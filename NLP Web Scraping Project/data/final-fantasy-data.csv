1595798574.0,"Patrick Rothfuss's editor confirms that, after nine years, she is yet to read a single word of THE DOORS OF STONE","In somewhat surprising news, Patrick Rothfuss's editor Betsy Wollheim [has reported](https://www.facebook.com/betsy.wollheim/posts/3449737608372826) that she is yet to read any material from his next novel, *The Doors of Stone*, the third and concluding volume in **The Kingkiller Chronicle**, and notes a lack of communication on the book's progress.

Rothfuss shot to fame with the first book in the trilogy, *The Name of the Wind*, in 2007. With over 10 million sales, *The Name of the Wind* became one of the biggest-selling debut fantasy novels of the century. The second book, *The Wise Man's Fear*, did as well on release in 2011. Nine years later, the third book remains unpublished.

*The Doors of Stone* is probably the second-most-eagerly-awaited fantasy novel of the moment, behind only George R.R. Martin's *The Winds of Winter*, which it actually exceeds in waiting time (though only by five months). Martin has [provided](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/06/23/writing-reading-writing/) [updates](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/07/19/writing-2/) on *The Winds of Winter*, albeit extremely infrequent ones, but has recently reported much more significant progress being made. Rothfuss, on the other hand, has maintained near constant zero radio silence on the status of book in recent years, despite posting a picture of an apparently semi-complete draft in 2013 that was circulating among his beta readers.

Reasons for the delay, as with Martin, have been speculated. Rothfuss has reported bouts of ill health, as well as trauma related to family bereavements. Rothfuss was also closely involved in an attempt to launch a multimedia adaptation of his books, which would have involved both a trilogy of films based directly on the novels and a prequel TV series revolving around the parents of his protagonist, Kvothe. However, the TV show was cancelled mid-development at Showtime, apparently due to massive cost overruns on their **Halo** television series, and a new network has not yet picked up the series. The movies also fell out of active development when director Sam Raimi, who had expressed interest, decided to move forward with a different project. Both projects now appear to be on the backburner at Lionsgate (unsurprisingly, the pandemic has not helped this situation).

Rothfuss has also been involved in charity work, blogging, video game commentary, spin-off material and contributing writing to other projects, causing comparisons to be drawn with Martin's similar engagement in secondary projects, which some commentators have speculated is the main cause of delays on the books. Without having access to an author's schedule, it is of course impossible to say if this is really the case, only that the *perception* of it being the case becomes unavoidable if the author in question is refusing to provide concrete updates on their book progress whilst discussing other, unrelated work in multiple public communications. Questions of ethics and obligations on the part of authors to their readers have circulated on this subject for decades, ever since the delays to Harlan Ellison's *The Last Dangerous Visions* (originally due to be published in 1974, Ellison was allegedly still occasionally promising to publish it at the time of his death in 2018) stretched into the decades, and have been debated ad nauseam online enough to avoid going over them again here, suffice to say that the tolerance for such activities will vary dramatically by reader.

>""[This article](https://bookriot.com/authors-dont-owe-you-books/amp/?fbclid=IwAR3EjfvLBvDLzzbOe9qdARUQISwCx0uD6Rz9txcT3QbDea3IVg01Y9_tAk8) is right: authors don't owe their readership books, but what about the publishers who paid them? Book publishing is not as lucrative as many other professions, and publishers rely on their strongest sellers to keep their companies (especially small companies like DAW) afloat. When authors don't produce, it basically f\*\*\*s their publishers...When I delayed the publication of book two, Pat was very open with his fans--they knew what was happening. I've never seen a word of book three.""

Wollheim's statement is surprising, however. Martin has noted being in communication with his editors on numerous occasions, flying to New York to provide in-person updates and apologise for the book's lateness, and periodically submitting completed batches of chapters for them to work on whilst he continues to write new material. In the case of **The Kingkiller Chronicle**, Wollheim reports not having read a single word of *The Doors of Stone* in the nine years since *The Wise Man's Fear* was published, which is mind-boggling. If Rothfuss had a semi-complete draft in 2013 that he was circulating to friends and early readers, the question arises why he didn't also share this draft with his publishers. Furthermore, if the book's non-appearance since 2013 indicates considerable problems with this draft (as would appear inevitable), it would also appear to be common sense to share that draft with his publishers to see if they agree. It's not uncommon for authors to believe their latest novel is poor and a disaster and threaten to delete it and having to be talked off the ledge by their editors, since they've been working so closely on the material that they've lost all objectivity.

Normally, of course, authors only share completed manuscripts (at least in first draft) with their editor, but when the author in question is a decade behind schedule and one of the biggest-selling authors in the publishers' stable, that normally changes to having much more regular feedback.

Although she notes the impact a long-missing manuscript can have on the margins of a small publisher like DAW, Wollheim notes no ill feeling towards Rothfuss and she continues to be proud of him and the work they've done in the first two volumes:

1655851518.0,11 questions I wish male fantasy authors would ask themselves before publishing.,"I’ve been a diehard fantasy fan all my life, but I am so constantly frustrated by series like WoT and Night Angel that simplify women or use them to make men look cooler. I wrote these a while ago and thought I’d share. Would love additions!

1. Do your female characters have inner struggles/ identity journeys or emotional developments that have nothing to do with motherhood or romantic love?
2. Are your female characters as complex as their male counterparts?
3. One in four women has been raped. The rape scene you’re thinking about including  could very well alienate, traumatize, or lose you the loyalty of a big chunk of your potential audience. Knowing this, do you still think it is essential to the plot? Are you using it to create a meaningful motivation and essential piece of the story, or are you just trying to create a general aura of evilness for this (rapist) character or this world? Could something else work instead?
4. Are your any female characters single dimensionally morally pure or single-dimensionally seductive sex pots? Do you have madonnas and whores? 
5. If we know your character’s breast size, do we also know what her face looks like and at least three facets of her personality? 
6. If your (male) hero has a love interest or, especially, TWO, have we as readers seen enough evidence to justify that love? Have we seen growing intellectual connection, mutual respect, etc . , or is this just adoration from afar? Are you using female characters as foils to make your male characters look cool?
7. Have you considered drawing from aspects of real women you know—like capturing your mom’s propensity for taking new neighbors under her wing or your friend’s struggles feeling comfortable working in a male-dominated field?
8. Do you have characters whose gender doesn’t matter? Could they be women?
9. Do you have opportunities to ground your female characters in ways that make them feel relatable rather than idealistic? (E.g. body hair/acne, coping with societal pressures, identity crises, family obligations warring with dreams, depression or other mental health issues etc.)
10. Are you sure your understanding of a an experience in the female body (like pregnancy or periods) is accurate? Have you asked at least one and ideally multiple women who have gone through that experience to read it and confirm that it is? 
11. If you have a hero that we’re supposed to like and be rooting for, how does he treat the women in his world?

Edit: shout out to my boy Brandon Sanderson, though, for doing female characters (imo) exceptionally well.

Edit 2: Wheel of Time might have been a bad example (there are lots of women characters, and many have depth). I didn’t mean to condemn either that series or Night Angel, both of which I enjoyed. 

And edit 3: To the people who are angry with this post, I never meant to antagonize male writers or suggest they’re all bad. I just wanted to express my personal sense of feeling misunderstood and possibly be helpful if new writers ARE looking for guidance. If you’re on the fence about whether to send an angry message, please don’t. I have immense love and respect for everyone in this community.

Also, I’d personally love a similar list for women authors to ask themselves about male characters! 

Another edit (I’m so sorry lol): the rape stat in question 3 varies by source ([here](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence) is one that says 1 in 6). My point is just that it’s common.",Fantasy

You’ve a gift for language, you’re a deft hand at plotting, and your books seem to have an enormous amount of attention to detail put into them. You’re so good you could write anything. Why write fantasy?**

Pratchett: I had a decent lunch, and I’m feeling quite amiable. That’s why you’re still alive. I think you’d have to explain to me why you’ve asked that question.

**O: It’s a rather ghettoized genre.**

P: This is true. I cannot speak for the US, where I merely sort of sell okay. But in the UK I think every book— I think I’ve done twenty in the series— since the fourth book, every one has been one the top ten national bestsellers, either as hardcover or paperback, and quite often as both. Twelve or thirteen have been number one. I’ve done six juveniles, all of those have nevertheless crossed over to the adult bestseller list. On one occasion I had the adult best seller, the paperback best-seller in a different title, and a third book on the juvenile bestseller list. Now tell me again that this is a ghettoized genre.

**O: It’s certainly regarded as less than serious fiction.**

P: (Sighs) Without a shadow of a doubt, the first fiction ever recounted was fantasy. Guys sitting around the campfire— Was it you who wrote the review? I thought I recognized it— Guys sitting around the campfire telling each other stories about the gods who made lightning, and stuff like that. They did not tell one another literary stories. They did not complain about difficulties of male menopause while being a junior lecturer on some midwestern college campus.

Fantasy is without a shadow of a doubt the ur-literature, the spring from which all other literature has flown. Up to a few hundred years ago no one would have disagreed with this, because most stories were, in some sense, fantasy. Back in the middle ages, people wouldn’t have thought twice about bringing in Death as a character who would have a role to play in the story. Echoes of this can be seen in Pilgrim’s Progress, for example, which hark back to a much earlier type of storytelling. The epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest works of literature, and by the standard we would apply now— a big muscular guys with swords and certain godlike connections— That’s fantasy. The national literature of Finland, the Kalevala. Beowulf in England. I cannot pronounce Bahaghvad-Gita but the Indian one, you know what I mean. The national literature, the one that underpins everything else, is by the standards that we apply now, a work of fantasy.

Now I don’t know what you’d consider the national literature of America, but if the words Moby Dick are inching their way towards this conversation, whatever else it was, it was also a work of fantasy. Fantasy is kind of a plasma in which other things can be carried. I don’t think this is a ghetto. This is, fantasy is, almost a sea in which other genres swim. Now it may be that there has developed in the last couple of hundred years a subset of fantasy which merely uses a different icongraphy, and that is, if you like, the serious literature, the Booker Prize contender. Fantasy can be serious literature. Fantasy has often been serious literature. You have to fairly dense to think that Gulliver’s Travels is only a story about a guy having a real fun time among big people and little people and horses and stuff like that. What the book was about was something else. Fantasy can carry quite a serious burden, and so can humor. So what you’re saying is, strip away the trolls and the dwarves and things and put everyone into modern dress, get them to agonize a bit, mention Virginia Woolf a few times, and there! Hey! I’ve got a serious novel. But you don’t actually have to do that.

(Pauses) That was a bloody good answer, though I say it myself.",Fantasy
1622429952.0,"If an author doesn't bother to write female characters well, then they don't write characters well. Period.","*EDIT: Please stop sending me antagonistic DMs. If you have something to say, you can say it here where everyone can see you. I've had to block several people already. Grow up.*

A female character is a character that is female. The ""character"" part should be more important than the ""female"" descriptor in regards to their place in the fictional story. If an author is consistently writing them with a sexist lens or a shallow manner, or not making the effort to create nuanced female characters on the same level of the males, then maybe we should stop saying ""they don't write female characters well"" as a minor criticism but rather ""this author doesn't write characters well"" as a major criticism, because after all, the female characters... are **characters**, just like the males. They are people the author created, people inhabiting the story. Females are 50% of the human race and if an author is consistently *choosing* to write them in a lesser, demeaning, or shallow way, then that should be a major criticism of the way they write characters in general. 

I'm really aware of the way people talk about these things, the type of language they use to talk about characters, and I'm sick of women in fantasy books being referred to as almost an afterthought; for example, some version of this comment I've seen so many times for various series: ""I love this authors's work, but I definitely think they have a problem writing women,"" or ""I adore this series and I think the author is really talented, if you can just look past how they write women."" Like sorry, but no, I don't want to ""look past"" this. That's a quick way to make me never want to pick up that author's work. Life is way too short to spend time reading shitty ~~female~~ characters. 

**""Female character"" shouldn't be a separate sub-category, an afterthought... They're just characters, and how they are written is as indicative of an author's intent and character-work and storytelling ability as how they write male characters**. The level of criticism shouldn't be raised and lowered depending on the gender of the character. Whatever level of writing talent and character-work you expect for male characters shouldn't suddenly change for female characters in a story. And if it does, if you notice yourself doing this, if you notice yourself making excuses for the author and treating ""female characters"" as a lesser sub-category of ""character"" then take a moment to think about why that is and whether or not you want to continue reading that way. 

And yes, because I am certain someone will comment this, because a topic about women in literature can never just be discussed without someone needing to flip the argument, yes it goes the other way- if a female author consistently writes male characters poorly then they too should be criticized for their character writing.",Fantasy

Edit: Wow, I didn't expect that kind of response. Super happy so many found this useful! :)

Hey guys,

To make the fighting scenes in my low fantasy novel more realistic, I went to see a trainer for historical sword-fighting last week, both to barrage her with questions and to develop realistic choreographies for the fight scenes in the novel. Since I figured some of what she told me might be useful for you too, I put together a small list for you. Big thanks to [Gladiatores Munich](http://www.gladiatores-muenchen.de/) and Jeanne for making time! (More photos [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Sa-SZoWuP/))

*Caveat: I’m by no means a sword-fighting expert myself, so take these nuggets with a grain of salt – I might have misremembered or misinterpreted some of the things Jeanne told me. If I did, feel free to tell me.*

**1.)** **Weapon choices need to make sense**

Let’s start with a truism: always ensure your character’s weapons make sense for a.) their profession, b.) their cultural background and c.) the environment they’re going to fight in. A farmer probably couldn’t afford a sword and might use a knife or threshing flail instead, and someone who doesn’t want to be noticed probably wouldn’t be milling about sporting a glaive or another large weapon. Also, soldiers native to a country with wide open plains would be more likely to carry long-range melee weapons such as spears or large swords, than those from a country consisting of mostly jungle or dense forests. The same applies to situations: if your character is going to be fighting in close quarters (even just a normal house), he’d get little value out of a spear or even a longsword, as there’d be no space to swing it effectively.

**2.)** **Boldness often beats technique**

In real swordfights, recklessness was often more important than technique . The fighter who was less afraid of getting hurt or wounded would often push harder, allowing them to overpower even opponents with better technique.

*(Edited this because the phrasing wasn't ideal. Thanks for pointing it out!)*

**3.)** **Even a skilled fighter rarely stands a chance when outnumbered**

While a skilled (or lucky) fighter might win a two-versus-one, it’d be extremely unlikely for even a master swordsman to win a three versus one against opponents below his skill level. The only way to plausibly pull this off would be if he split the opponents up, perhaps by luring them into a confined space where he could take them on one by one. The moment they surround him, he'd probably be done for – because, unlike in Hollywood, they wouldn’t conveniently take turns attacking but come at him together.

**4.)** **Dual wielding was a thing**

... at least in some cultures. I often heard people say that people using a weapon in each hand is an invention of fiction. And while my instructor confirmed that she knew of no European schools doing this—if they did, it’s not well-documented—she said it was a thing in other cultures. Example of this include the dual wakizashi in Japan or tomahawk and knife in North America. However, one of the biggest problems with the depiction of dual wielding in novels/movies/games are the “windmill”-type attacks where the fighter swings their weapons independently, hitting in succession rather than simultaneously. Normally you’d always try hitting with both weapons at once, as you’d otherwise lose your advantage.

**5.)** **Longswords were amazing**

Longswords might seem boring in comparison to other weapons, but they were incredibly effective, especially in combat situations outside the battlefield. The crossguard allowed for effective blocking of almost any kind of attack (well, maybe not an overhead strike of a Mordaxt, but still), the pommel was also used as a powerful “blunt” weapon of its own that could crack skulls. Though they were somewhat less effective against armored opponents, the long, two-handed hilt allowed for precise thrusts at uncovered body parts that made up for it.

**6.)**  **“Zweihänder” were only used for very specific combat situations**

Zweihänder—massive two-handed swords—were only used for specific purposes and usually not in one-on-one combat as is often seen in movies or games. One of these purposes was using their reach to break up enemy formations. In fact, one type of two-handed sword even owed its name to that purpose: Gassenhauer (German, Gasse = alley, Hauer = striker)—the fighters literally used it to strike “alleys” into an enemy formation with wide, powerful swings.

7.) **It’s all about distance**

While I was subconsciously aware of this, it might be helpful to remember that distance was an incredibly important element in fights. The moment your opponent got past your weapons ideal range, it was common to either switch to a different weapon or just drop your weapon and resort to punching/choking. A good example of this are spears or polearms—very powerful as long as you maintain a certain range between you and your opponent, but the moment they get too close, your weapon is practically useless. That’s also why combatants almost always brought a second weapon into battle to fall back one.

8.) **Real fights rarely lasted over a minute**

Another truism, but still useful to remember: real fights didn’t last long, especially when only using light or no armor. Usually they were over within less than a minute, sometimes only seconds – the moment your opponent landed a hit (or your weapon broke or you were disarmed), you were done for.

**9.)** **Stop the pirouettes**

Unfortunately, the spinning around and pirouetting that makes many fight scenes so enjoyable to watch (or read) is completely asinine. Unless it's a showfight, fighters would *never* expose their backs to their opponent or turn their weapon away from them.

**10.)**  **It still looks amazing**

If your concern is that making your fight scenes realistic will make them less aesthetic, don’t worry. Apart from the fact that the blocks, swings and thrusts still look impressive when executed correctly, I personally felt that my fights get a lot more gripping and visceral if I respect the rules. To a certain extent, unrealistic and flashy combat is plot armor. If your characters can spin and somersault to their heart’s content and no one ever shoves a spear into their backs as they would have in real life, who survives and who doesn’t *noticeably* becomes arbitrary. If, on the other hand, even one slip-up can result in a combatant’s death, the stakes become really palpable.

That’s about it! I hope this post is as helpful to some of you as the lessons were to me. Again, if anything I wrote here is bollocks, it’s probably my fault and not Jeanne’s.

1612075372.0,The end of a 30 year relationship,"So roughly 30 years ago I was in a dusty military thrift shop in southern Arizona. My dad had just deployed overseas and my mom was ""thrifting"", a favorite hobby of hers. As any kid would do I wandered off on my own, eventually finding myself in the book section. It had maybe 40 books, mostly romance (those Army wives loved them some romance).

On the shelves I found one single book that looked interesting. Some strange 'The Wheel of Time' thing. It was a paperback and the thrift shop wanted 49 cents for it, and with at least two dollars burning a hole in my pocket that was a fantastic deal.

Once home I tore through this book faster than anything I had ever read. But it ended in such a cliffhanger. A really confusing, abrupt cliffhanger. It felt like there should be way more. And that is when I realized it wasn't a complete book! It was a promotional copy of The Eye of The World, by Robert Jordan. It was about the first 6 or so chapters. Imagine reading a great book and someone walks by and tears it in half and takes the entire ending with them. That is what it felt like. And this was pre-everything. I couldn't just pop onto my Kindle and be reading an eBook copy in a few seconds.

My mom didn't even drive, we had walked that day I bought the book.

So heading off-base to a legit book store was not happening. And the nearest book store was miles away in a neighboring town. My hopes were dashed. I did the only sensible thing I could think of: I grabbed my friends and we skipped town on our bikes. We rode off the base. To the next town. Across that town and found the store. And I found The Eye of The World in glorious hardcover edition. And couldn't afford it. Not even close. All of us putting our money together wouldn't have been able to buy it. I hadn't known how much new books cost, I had never owned one.

That thrift shop had ruined my economic perception of the world.

I rode all the way back home. It was the saddest bike ride of my life. This exact moment led to me and all my friends starting a thriving lawncare business to make money, but that is another story.

A few months later I found the book in my bedroom. My mom had bought it. And every single release day for the next 7-8 years, even though I had money of my own, she'd buy me the next of the series. It was the one gift she knew I'd love. It became our thing. She became almost as excited about an upcoming book as me, and she didn't even read them. But that was how my love of the series was born. When Mr. Jordan eventually passed away, with the story unfinished, it broke my heart. An author and a story it felt like I had grown my whole life with, gone.

In fact it affected me so deeply that, even after learning the series would continue, I didn't read the final 3 books. Not because I feared Brandon Sanderson wouldn't do justice to the story (I love all of his books, for what its worth) but because I knew it was over. After I read those final books, it was done. There would be no more story. That world would be over.

It wasn't until this week, years and years later, at the ripe old age of 40, I read them. And yes, I did put the last book down with a tremendous sense of loss. Almost a hollow feeling. Like saying goodbye to a friend for the very last time, and knowing it *is* the very last time. But also I just had a feeling of gratitude. For Robert Jordan for starting me on this journey, his estate for allowing the journey to continue, and above all, to Mr. Sanderson. The skill, love and respect you brought to these final novels, it honestly makes me emotional.

I don't know what the mass reception of these books has been, for obvious reasons I had never read a single review. I don't know if they were hated or loved. All I know is what I feel, and all I can say is I'm glad you were the one.

Thank you, Robert Jordan. Thank you, Brandon Sanderson.

So what about you?

What is for you the one fantasy saga big TV networks needs to get their hands on asap?

My personal answer would be Robin Hobb. 

She may be my favorite fantasy writer. She is absolutely a master at crafting brillant and deep characters and making them go on such emotional journeys...

And the physical journey is one to behold as well, she's just as good at building a world... from Buck to Jamailia, from the Rain Wilds to the pirates isles, the world of the *Realm of the Elderlings* simply stays with you.

And I would absolutely love to see it on TV one day... I know Robin previously said she wasnt really open to the idea but things have moved on, we live in a golden age of TV and some networks could really do with a prestige fantasy TV show. And the story of Fitz is up there in terms of prestige. Though I hope they'd go all the way in and adapt all sagas.

The writer in me would give an eye (well, maybe not) to be involved in adapting the entire story on screen.

But I'm curious to read what would be your top choice.",Fantasy

1607795386.0,Middle-earth from Sauron's Perspective,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I'll be honest, I actually have a bit of a soft spot for Sauron. That's not to say he's in any way a good guy, but I do really enjoy his character, and I'd consider him (possibly) the most interesting villain in the Legendarium. Which is pretty nuts when we consider that he only has the *most* limited appearance on the pages of *The Lord of the Rings,* despite the fact that he *is* the titular Lord of said rings. The problem is that by the Third Age, Sauron was  just a (metaphorical) shadow of his former self, and by the time of the more recognisable elements in the Legendarium such as Gondor, Hobbits, and the Wizards, Sauron's most interesting days are behind him. So today I want to chronicle the Ages of Arda from the perspective of Sauron, and try to explain what makes *The Deceiver* such a great character. 

Now Sauron is a being with many many names, and way back in the beginning, no one would have thought to call him Sauron. You see what Sauron actually means in the Quenya language of the Elves is *""the abhorred""*, and so this name was used only *after* his fall into darkness. However in *The Silmarillion* his original name is never given, and when *Morgoth's Ring* was published 17 years later, all we're told is that Sauron was what he was ""*afterwards called.""* So what was his original name? Well it wasn't until 2007 that this question was finally answered. So in the 17th issue of the *Parma Eldarlamberon,* which is a book of Elven Tongues concerning names and words from Tolkien's fictional languages, which was written by the Professor in the 1950s but not published until *way* more recently, we're told that Sauron's original name was *Mairon*. Which means ""*the Admirable.""* And this is key to understanding Sauron's character. 

Because back in the beginning Sauron was not a creature of darkness. He was in fact the complete opposite.

Right at the beginning, before the universe was even made, Eru Ilúvatar (God with a capital G) created the Ainur, *""the Holy Ones, that were the offspring of his thought.""* Now the mightiest of all the Ainur was Melkor, and he was destined to become the first Dark Lord. And to be honest, in my opinion, Melkor absolutely sucks. After him, the fourteen most powerful Ainur are known as the Valar, and in some ways they're kind of similar to a pantheon of gods and goddesses (with a little g). And the rest of the Ainur are known as Maiar, sort of like angels or demi-gods. And one of these Maiar was Mairon. And unlike most other dark Maiar such as the balrogs, Mairon was not originally a follower of Melkor. Instead he was a pupil of Aulë, the Vala of crafting.

And this is also very important to Sauron's character. Because, if for a moment we remove all the ethics and all the morality from him, at his core, Sauron is the greatest craftsman ever to live in Middle-earth. And this love of crafting is central to his purpose and motivation. It's very important to note that whereas Melkor turned to evil out of a jealous desire to bring about discord, ruin, and dominion, Sauron's motives are much more understandable. Mairon was a lover of order and perfection. And as the greatest of the Maiar, he believed himself worthy of ruling Middle-earth and crafting his vision of a world without waste or turmoil. Now as is so often the case with geniuses, this desire soon turned to obsession, and before long, Mairon found himself admiring Melkor's power ""*to effect his designs quickly and masterfully.""* And thus Mairon was corrupted into Sauron, and *""for long he served another and not himself.""*

Now in order to keep this story moving, I'm going to have to skip forward tens of thousands of years, to the moment where Melkor is defeated and imprisoned by the Valar, after the War for the Sake of the Elves. So for three long ages, (which with a bit of Tolkien maths we can calculate as 2874.6 years as we'd reckon it), Melkor is locked away in the West, but Sauron is not locked away with him. Instead Sauron simply remains in Middle-earth, and he spends these long ages faithfully rebuilding Melkor's armies and awaiting his master's eventual return. And in this time we can speculate that Sauron may have given some thought to the future, and to the perfectly ordered world that he hoped to build with Melkor. 

But this is not what happened. When Melkor eventually did return to Middle-earth, he was angrier, pettier, and more bitter than ever before. And instead of crafting Middle-earth into a perfectly ordered kingdom, he simply wanted to pollute, ruin, and pervert everything that the Elves and the Valar had built. His goal was to corrupt Middle-earth into something obscene. And I imagine this must have struck a sour chord with Sauron. But still, Sauron remained faithful to his master. 

Now throughout the First Age of the Sun, Sauron became Melkor's chief disciple, and along with the Lord of the Balrogs, Gothmog, he was the Dark Lord's highest ranked servant. But unlike Gothmog, Sauron was no warrior. In fact in the entire Legendarium, he only wins one single fight. However it's at this time that we get some more of Sauron's many names. Because among the Sindar Elves of Beleriand, legend told of a dark sorcerer known only as *Gorthaur the Cruel* (Gorthaur means terrible dread in Sindarin), and this sorcerer turned out to be of course...Sauron. 

So Gorthaur did a lot of terrible things, and he killed a lot of innocent people, and it's at this early point that he seemed to develop a bit of a chip on his shoulder in regards to Men. You see, Melkor's great enemy were the Elves, but even in the First Age, Sauron developed a particular disdain for Men, and he desired to rule them all. This will be important later. Now Sauron's great claim to fame in the First Age comes with the tale of Beren and Lúthien. And I don't want to spoil specifics, but just before this story, Sauron invaded the Elven island of *Tol Sirion*, and he renamed it *Tol-in-Gaurhoth - the Island of Werewolves.* And it was this island that both Beren and Lúthien came to. But to be honest, this is not Sauron's finest hour. I mean to be fair, he did defeat Galadriel's older brother in a magical battle of music, he imprisoned Beren in a werewolf infested dungeon, and he also found himself in possession of the Ring of Barahir at this time, which I like to imagine sparked some sort of curiosity of his own in regards to forging magical rings in the future. But ultimately Sauron was utterly defeated when Lúthien and her faithful hound came to rescue her lover. 

And this is the last that we see of Sauron for hundreds of years. He fled from Tol-in-Gaurhoth, and we can presume he returned to his master Melkor, but he does nothing else for the rest of the First Age. And I have to speculate that things did not go well for Sauron when he returned to his master. His failure to kill Beren and Lúthien ultimately began a chain of events that ended with the eventual destruction and defeat of Melkor. And I imagine Sauron was severely punished for his failings. In fact, I would speculate that during this time, Sauron may have begun to grow resentful of Melkor, and it may have entered his mind that *he* would make a far better Dark Lord. 

Anyway, the next time that we see Sauron is after the defeat of Melkor in the War of Wrath. Now this was a devastating war in which the Valar basically destroyed the region of Beleriand in order to banish Melkor into the void. And so when Sauron returns to the story, he doesn't do so as a servant of darkness, but instead in a fair and repentant form. In fact Sauron even approached a dude called Eönwë (the highest-ranking Maia of them all) and he begged forgiveness and pardon. However forgiveness was not Eönwë's to give. Sauron was told that if he truly wanted forgiveness, he must kneel before the Valar and accept whatever punishment they deem worthy. But for Sauron this was simply too great a humiliation, and instead of facing his due judgement, he fled far into the South East. 

Now we can speculate for days as to whether Sauron was genuine in his repentance or not, but either way it doesn't really matter. Because by the time that the Second Age began, Sauron had relapsed into a being of darkness once more. Except this time, he was done acting as the servant of another. 

So with Melkor (and all of Beleriand) gone, Middle-earth entered its Second Age, and this is the Age in which Sauron really came into his own. But he took his sweet time in doing so. For the first 500 years, Elves and Men lived together in peace without any interference from a Dark Lord. Gil-galad was the High King of the Noldorin Elves, and Elrond's brother became the High King of the Men of Númenor. Again, Númenor will be an important part of what comes next. 

So remember how I said that Sauron fled into the South East? Well it's there that he founded the lands of Mordor, and began to corrupt many southeasterly men from Harad and Rhûn into his service. But unlike his later incarnations, Sauron was not yet openly committed to evil. After all, if there's one thing that's true about Sauron, it's that he is the deceiver. 

So by the year 1200 of the Second Age, the Elves of Eregion had become some of the finest craftsmen in Middle-earth. And under the command of their lord Celebrimbor, a brotherhood of Elven jewel smiths founded the *Gwaith-i-Mírdain,* which began creating objects of exquisite power and beauty. And it was at this time, that a divine and angelic being came to Eregion. His origins were a mystery but he introduced himself as *Annatar - The Lord of Gifts.* 

Now I doubt it will come as too much of a spoiler that of course Annatar's secret identity is in fact Sauron. And Sauron had not forgotten his ambition to craft Middle-earth into his warped version of a perfect world. Now I've found that when one Google searches images of Annatar he's often portrayed as an evil looking elf, but this is not the case at all. Annatar was astoundingly fair to look upon, and no one but the few absolute wisest beings in Middle-earth had any reason to mistrust him. And unfortunately for the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, Celebrimbor was not one of these few. 

So Annatar taught the Elves of Eregion how to forge Rings of Power, and together they created the first sixteen rings that would one day be split into the Nine and the Seven. But in secret, Celebrimbor forged three rings of his own, and Sauron had no hand in their creation. These are of course the Elven rings, and this is actually the reason why Sauron isn't able to dominate the Elven ring-bearers in the same way he dominates the nine Men into his Nazgûl. But we all know that Celebrimbor wasn't the only one to forge rings in secret. And in the fires of the Sammath Naur, better known as the Cracks of Doom, Sauron forged the One Ring. 

Now, I don't want to go making excuses for Sauron. He was a bad guy. But I do believe that if the Elves of Eregion had willingly joined with Annatar at this point, and submitted themselves to the power of his Ruling Ring, then all the ugliness that followed may not have had to occur. But of course it did occur. Because the moment that Sauron put on his Ring in Mordor, hundreds of miles away, Celebrimbor sensed his evil, and the days of trusting Annatar came to an abrupt end. 

So what follows is known as the War of the Elves and Sauron, and I won't go into specifics, or else this post would be 10,000 words long, but I have to say that it ends particularly horribly for Celebrimbor. His body is shot with arrows, impaled on a spike, and then carried around by Orcs as their war banner. But Celebrimbor's sacrifice is not for nothing. Although Sauron does successfully reclaim the original sixteen Rings of Power, Celebrimbor sends the Three far away, and Sauron never gets his hands on them. Now this war is long and bloody, but as is so often the case with Sauron, he actually loses pretty much every single battle. You see, although Sauron more-or-less defeated the Elves, he was in turn defeated by a great army of Men from Númenor who came to the Elves' aid. And I think this really cemented Sauron's hatred of Men forever. 

However despite the fact that Sauron lost the war, over the next few thousand years, he came to dominate almost all of Middle-earth. Slowly his power spread, and the way he did this demonstrates how Sauron is much better suited to political influence than he is to military might. Despite magnificently losing the war, by the 1800s of the Second Age, Sauron was worshiped by almost all Men in Middle-earth. During the following Dark Years, Sauron revealed his Nazgûl for the first time, corrupted the inhabitants of southern Middle-earth, and he (probably) burned the Entwives alive in their gardens (which is arguably the worst thing he ever does). In fact the only three places in Middle-earth that were really able to resist Sauron were the Elven refuges of Lindon, Rivendell, and Lothlórien.  And during these long years where Sauron ruled, he even declared himself the Lord of the Earth, and the King of Men. But that turned out to be a mistake. 

You see Númenor was not a part of Sauron's empire. It was an island nation that existed far from Sauron's influence in Middle-earth. And Númenor was the realm of the most powerful Men ever to exist in the Legendarium. So the King of Númenor did *not* appreciate Sauron declaring himself the King of Men. And in his arrogance the King of Númenor, who's name was Pharazôn, decided he would declare war on the Dark Lord and teach him who the true King of Men really was.

And this is pretty much what happened. Pharazôn mustered a fleet and an army. He sailed to Middle-earth, and he marched right up to the the Black Gate of Mordor. And just to give you an idea of how mighty the Númenorean army truly was, not a single living thing stood in there way throughout their entire march. When they finally did arrive outside Mordor, they were ready to slay every orc and troll that they found inside. But no battle ever happened. Instead Sauron himself came out to meet Pharazôn and his army, and immediately, Sauron knelt, and surrendered himself to be taken as Pharazôn's prisoner. And so the Dark Lord was taken to Númenor in chains.

Now I would argue that this next part of the tale, is one of the most interesting stories that Professor Tolkien ever wrote. Because Sauron came to Númenor as a hostage, but only 57 years later, he was responsible for wiping Númenor off the map forever! 

So in order to fully understand this, we need a brief overview of Númenor's history. 3000 years ago, back at the beginning of the Second Age, Númenor was was the most wonderful place. It was governed by great kings who ruled for hundreds of years and lived in peace and harmony with the Elves of Middle-earth. *And* with the Elves of the West. But this didn't last. Over the millennia, a shadow fell upon Númenor. You see when their island was first brought out of the sea, it was a gift from Eru Ilúvatar. But there was one rule. The Númenoreans were allowed to sail wherever they wanted, but they could not sail West. They could not sail to the Undying Lands. And in time, the Men of Númenor began to resent this rule. They began to resent their mortality which they viewed as a curse. Their relation with the Elves turned to hatred, and by the time of Pharazôn, the Kings of Númenor considered themselves enemies of the West and enemies of the Valar. Now all of this is great news for Sauron!

Because, as I've said a few times already, Sauron was the deceiver. He couldn't destroy the Men of Númenor with orcs and trolls, but he could deceive them into destroying themselves. And this is exactly what he did. So in the span of only a few years, Sauron went from Pharazôn's prisoner to his chief advisor. And he did so by playing on Pharazôn's fear of mortality. The older the king grew, and the closer to death that he came, the more he relied upon Sauron. And the greater Sauron's influence over Númenor extended. And Sauron knew exactly what lies to tell the king. 

He told Pharazôn a story. He told Pharazôn lies about the Valar. And he told Pharazôn about the one being who who was powerful enough to fight them. Melkor. *""The Giver of Freedom.""* So for the second time in his life, Sauron became Melkor's Chief Disciple, although this time I believe it was all a deception. Sauron promised the king that by turning from Eru Ilúvatar and worshiping Melkor instead, the secrets of immortality would be revealed to him. And Pharazôn believed every word. 

As the years went on, Sauron became the de facto ruler of Númenor *""from behind the throne"",* and he adopted his old name from eons ago. *Tar-Mairon - King Excellent.* Although I should clarify that the Númenoreans never used this Elven name because they hatred the Elven language, and so in Adûnaic (the language of the Nûmenoreans) Sauron was known as Zigûr, which means the Wise One. 

Now Sauron's rule in Númenor was brutal, and he made the worship of Melkor into the official state religion. A great black temple was constructed in the nation's capital, and inside there was a black seat for Sauron and a great fiery altar. Upon this altar The White Tree of Númenor was burned to ashes, and when that was done, the Kingsmen of Númenor turned to human sacrifice. Only a small number of Faithful Númenoreans refused to betray the Valar, and many of these were murdered in Sauron's temple. It was hoped that their bloody offerings would free Pharazôn from his fated death. But it didn't work. 

In the end, Sauron told the King that there was only one way to achieve immortality. He must take it through conquest. And so, Sauron convinced Pharazôn to build a great armament of ships, and to sail West. To declare war upon the Valar. 

And so *that* is how Sauron wiped Númenor from existence. When the first of Pharazôn's ships landed on the Undying Lands, Eru Ilúvatar himself intervened, and he changed the shape of the world, so that no Men could ever again sail into the West again. And in this cataclysm, the Kingsmen were destroyed. Númenor was obliterated, and not unlike the legend of Atlantis, it was lost beneath the waves. Now ironically Pharazôn actually got his wish. He was buried alive *""under falling hills,""* and there he will remain for countless millennia, in the Cave of the Forgotten, *""until the Last Battle and the Day of Doom"".*

However as it goes, Sauron himself was also utterly destroyed when Númenor fell. But he wasn't gone. He had the One Ring, and so although his body was lost, his essence survived, and in time he was able to rebuild. 

And this pretty much catches us up to the story of Sauron that we're all familiar with. Only 111 years later, the surviving Faithful Númenoreans, under their new High King Elendil, made a Last Alliance with the Noldor's High King Gil-galad. And after ten years of war the two High Kings eventually defeated Sauron in one on one (or I guess two on one) combat. However they gave their lives to do so. And as I'm sure everyone here knows, Sauron was eventually defeated when Elendil's son took up his father's broken blade, and cut the ring from Sauron's vanquished hand. 

Now we all know that this isn't the end of Sauron's story. His malice endured throughout all of the Third Age, but his days as the deceiver were over. Never again would he be the Lord of the Earth. And to be honest, I feel that Sauron in the Third Age is but a shade of who he'd been before. By the time of the Lord of the Rings, he was a tyrant and a lord of evil, but he wasn't really much more than that. He was a far cry from Tar-Mairon. A far cry from the admired Maia spirit who'd had so much potential so long ago. 

Sauron wanted to rule a perfect world, but in the end, the deceiver was deceived by his own warped sense of virtue. Perhaps the thing to take away from Sauron's story is the danger of believing that perfection can be forced through dominion. Or that order can be crafted by control. 

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on one of Middle-earth's finest villains.

1647060118.0,Unpopular Opinion: Most Fantasy Adaptions Would be Better as Animated TV Shows,"I don’t think this a popular opinion amongst fantasy fans, especially with cartoons and animated shows having a rap as being childish, but I think a lot of fantasy series adaptations would be better from this. 

Not only could the budget be utilized in different ways creating really cool animations, but with an animated TV show there is more room to tell the story, like in Harry Potter. For example, there could be more of the every day life at Hogwarts that drew people in to begin with,  along with the coziness and with a more fleshed out plot than what was possible in the movies. Plus, they could give Harry his mother eyes!

This leads into another point: presentation. A show like GOT is good for this. Due to budget reasons and the constraints of live action, things like the scope of the Wall, the  castles, the landscape, world, and characters had to have changes to be adapted to live action. This is one of the many reasons why asoiaf fans want an animated show when—or if, given GRRM’s recent blog post—the books are completed. 

Those are my points for my unpopular opinion, at least I assume it’s unpopular. I think fantasy series would be only helped by being made in the form of an animated show, though of course it depends on the series in question. 

I really hope to see shows/remakes done like this in the future. The biggest point is that they can make things look very cool and representative of the books their adapting.",Fantasy

1639292738.0,Anne Rice has passed away,">Earlier tonight, my mother, Anne Rice, passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke. She left us almost nineteen years to the day my father, her husband Stan, died. Below is a statement I posted to her Facebook page moments ago.


>Dearest People of Page. This is Anne’s son Christopher and it breaks my heart to bring you this sad news. Earlier tonight, Anne passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke. She left us almost nineteen years to the day my father, her husband Stan, died. The immensity of our family’s grief cannot be overstated. As my mother, her support for me was unconditional — she taught me to embrace my dreams, reject conformity and challenge the dark voices of fear and self-doubt. As a writer, she taught me to defy genre boundaries and surrender to my obsessive passions. In her final hours, I sat beside her hospital bed in awe of her accomplishments and her courage, awash in memories of a life that took us from the fog laced hills of the San Francisco Bay Area to the magical streets of New Orleans to the twinkling vistas of Southern California. As she kissed Anne goodbye, her younger sister Karen said, ""What a ride you took us on, kid."" I think we can all agree. Let us take comfort in the shared hope that Anne is now experiencing firsthand the glorious answers to many great spiritual and cosmic questions, the quest for which defined her life and career.  Throughout much of her final years, your contributions to this page brought her much joy, along with a profound sense of friendship and community. Anne will be interred in our family's mausoleum at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans in a private ceremony. Next year, a celebration of her life will take place in New Orleans. This event will be open to the public and will invite the participation of her friends, readers and fans who brought her such joy and inspiration throughout her life.

I remember that I really enjoyed it, and have been wanting to read it again. Unfortunately, I couldn't remember the name of the book, or the author.

Today, as soon as I woke up, the name of the book randomly popped into my head. I hopped out of bed, grabbed my phone, and googled it. Sure enough! It was the correct title!!

The book was ""Dark Waters"", by Robert S. Stone. Turns out it was a sequel to a book named ""Hazards Price"", that I've never read. I've ordered both books and cannot wait to read them.

There was no real point to this post, other than wanting to share my excitement. Not being able to remember that book has driven me CRAZY for YEARS!!! Anyone else familiar with it?",Fantasy

1641835945.0,"Publishing news: Amazon shuts down account of Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki, editor of Year's Best African Speculative Fiction, without explanation, refuses to pay out over $2000 in royalties","One of the best trends we've seen in fantasy and science fiction in recent years is the explosion in accessibility of non-Western fantasy and speculative traditions entering the global English language market. 

For those not familiar with him, Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki is a Nigerian SF/F writer and editor who has been doing amazing work to showcase African speculative fiction. He's won the Otherwise (formerly Tiptree) and British Fantasy awards and been nominated for the Nebula, Locus, and others. He edited the first Year's Best African Speculative Fiction anthology ([review in Locus](https://locusmag.com/2022/01/t-g-shenoy-reviews-the-years-best-african-speculative-fiction-by-oghenechovwe-donald-ekpeki/)), the award-winning anthology Dominion with Zelda Knight, and is editing the upcoming Tor anthology Africa Risen with Knight and Sheree Renée Thomas (current editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, best known for the Dark Matter anthologies).

The Year's Best African Speculative Fiction, which contains fiction from both African writers and writers from the African diaspora, rightly made a splash in the field, and I enjoyed listening to [Ekpeki's recent interview on the Coode Street Podcast](https://jonathanstrahan.podbean.com/e/episode-564-oghenechovwe-ekpeki-and-african-speculative-fiction/). He has in the past detailed issues he's had as a Nigerian in this industry, from being unable to use PayPal to [people not respecting African names](https://www.sfwa.org/2021/12/14/oghenechovwe-donald-ekpeki-african-names/).

Today, Oghenechovwe Ekpeki [posted this thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Penprince_/status/1480478847485325313) about a really messed up situation with Amazon. Ekpeki published the anthology through a press he set up, Jembefola Press, and so put it on Amazon himself. He was told he'd receive the accrued royalties in January (which he was waiting on to be able to finish paying contributors), over $2000 so far. On December 31, Amazon emailed him to say they were shutting down his account because he either had multiple accounts and/or his account was ""related to"" a banned account. He has no idea what they're talking about and they've refused to clarify in follow-up. They're saying all the royalties are forfeited.

It's a really messed up situation and goes to show yet another reason why we should be concerned with Amazon's growing dominance of the book market. Hundreds of people got this anthology through Amazon to read exciting new work and support the writers and editor in bringing it to them, but Amazon ends up with all the money, the people who actually produced the work get left out in the cold, and one of the most significant rising editorial talents in the fantasy and science fiction field gets banned from the largest global publishing platform. Likely because some internal system thought it was suspicious that someone was publishing from Nigeria. Now without access to the primary ebook market, Jembefola Press will have to shut down and Ekpeki won't be able to directly publish anymore (which affects at least an upcoming nonfiction anthology as well, for which he had already fronted expenses).

This subreddit is a great community so I'm posting this here for a few reasons.

* The anthology ebook is still available [on Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-years-best-african-speculative-fiction-ogenchovwe-donald-ekpeki/1139994697) in case anyone is interested in buying it. Hopefully those royalties will still make it through. Edit: [here’s a list of other places you can find it](https://jembefola.com/the-years-best-african-speculative-fiction-2021/).

* Ekpeki is going to do some kind of fundraising to benefit the writers whose payments are affected by this, so look out for that hopefully soon. Currently he's looking for a platform that he'll be able to use from Nigeria (GoFundMe is out), so if you happen to know one that would work, I'm sure he'd appreciate anyone leaving a suggestion on that twitter thread.

* Just a PSA in general that Amazon is no stranger to unethical business practices. Buy from other sources when you can, like local bookstores or online site like [Powell's](https://www.powells.com/), [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/), or [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/). Even for ebooks, there are often other sources.

* This is just the latest example of barriers to non-Western creators getting their work out and being an active part of the field we all love. It's worth going out of your way to look for and support these writers and editors, if for no other reason than that they bring different perspectives and traditions to the table and that can produce mind-blowing fiction.

Edit: sounds like this kind of thing has been happening to a lot of authors on Amazon! While cases like this have the added barrier of someone trying to figure out these systems from outside the county, it can happen to anyone anywhere, and sounds like a nightmare to get anything done about it.",Fantasy

1596562620.0,"No, Mistborn Is Not Romance: An Essay on Romance Recommendations and Where They Go Wrong","This particular rant has been simmering in my head for a while. I did a twitter rant about a year ago that I have always wanted to rework into something more comprehensive and coherent, less scattered and hasty. So even though, yes, I can't deny the motivation to get around to writing and finish it has been inspired by a recent rather disastrous thread, it's something I've been thinking about for a long time.  
  
I am both a fantasy reader and, since much more recently, a romance reader. I'm not claiming to be an expert, I know for a fact there are people on this subreddit who are much more well-read and well-versed in it than I, but it pains and infuriates me that every time someone asks for fantasy romance recommendations (it's even a Bingo square this year!) the same thing happens: no matter how specific the OP's post, there will be a slew of unhelpful, hilariously off topic recommendations mixed with misconceptions and general uselessness galore. Since I'm eternally an optimist, I believe that one day, it will be possible to ask for romance recommendations and get recommendations that are mostly helpful.   
  
Now, let's clear up some terminology first.  
  
# What is romance?  
  
For a book to qualify as romance-the-genre, there are only two conditions:  
  
* A romantic relationship must be **central** to the plot somehow, if you take it out the story would not work. 
* It must feature a HEA (happily ever after) or HFN (happy for now) ending.^1 
  
These two are non-negotiable, same as fantasy requiring to have either some supernatural element, whether magic or non-human creatures (like vampires) AND/OR being set in a secondary world. Except with romance it's AND instead of AND/OR, it **must** have both. 

Now, with SFF romance, there will probably be some other stuff going on plot-wise. But suffice to say, if someone is asking for romance, the relationship must have *significant* pagetime and focus.   
  
Edit: You can also think of it like this, fantasy is a setting-based genre (setting matters for the definition, plot does not) and romance is a plot-based genre (plot matters for the definition, setting does not). So overlap is incredibly easy since they complement each other well, but they're defined from almost opposite angles.  
  
# What is a romantic subplot?  
  
A romantic subplot features people falling in love. It may end well, it may end tragically. It may feature two, or three, or more people. It may have significant pagetime, it may only develop in the last couple chapters. It's a common component and people have different tolerances and preferences. 
  
But, on its own, **a romantic subplot does not make a book romance**.     
  
# Where do recommendations go wrong?

The core issue seems to be fairly simple: to put it bluntly, **many fantasy readers here do not read romance and as such have no clue about what a romance reader would want or expect.**     
  
Mistborn is not romance.^2  
  
Wheel of Time is not romance.  
  
The Witcher is not romance.  
    
*Not every fucking book that has people falling in love is fucking romance.*   
  
Ignorance would not be a problem per se - not everybody likes or has to read everything, and I started off with definitions for a reason - if a vocal share of those who do not read or like romance did not think they are absolute experts on it and know better than those who do. Doesn't help that romance is coded feminine^3 and as such often looked down on, as if it's something lesser.    
  
Most books feature a romantic subplot of some sort to the extent it's incredibly difficult to find a fantasy book that center on friendships or family relationships^4. But said near-obligatory romance subplot usually isn't integral to the main plot (and often not done particularly well^5 \). While it may be a feature of the main plot, or important to the character arc of the protagonists, the romance is ultimately not what the book revolves around.  
  
Someone who is *specifically* asking for romance usually isn't asking for any old book that features people falling in love. And unless they are a clueless time traveller or a literature student, they almost certainly aren't looking for a romance in the 17th century sense of the word or any other alternate definition. Definitions change and deliberate, malicious obtuseness serves no one.    
   
# What romance is and what it isn't: a comparison

So, to highlight the difference, I'll compare Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson and A Charm of Magpies by K.J. Charles. Mistborn because it's the new Malazan and it being recommended as romance even though it isn't is a bit of a meme, A Charm of Magpies...honestly mostly because it's the first fantasy (= not normal historical) romance series I read that came to mind. There are other, probably better examples, but this is already getting long, so let's stay focused on two.   
  
## Is the relationship central to the book? 
  
In Mistborn, no, not really. It's not even close to the main theme, doesn't take up a significant amount of pagetime, and the book would still work without it. In addition, there is no chemistry between the leads and it isn't very in-depth.   
  
On the other hand, if you take away the relationship between Lucien and Stefen in A Charm of Magpies, there is no book left. It's more central to the series than the subplots about who placed a curse on Lucien in the first book, or the mystery of the giant rats in the second. 
  
## Is there a HEA/HFN?  
  
A Charm of Magpies: Yes.  

Mistborn: >!Given that both Elend and Vin die in the end, no, there is not.!< This would be an *absolute* no-no in a romance book.    
  
# What should we do?  
  
Really, it's the same as with any kind of recommendation request.  
   
* **Be mindful of what the OP wants.** The spirit, not the letter.    
* Be mindful of Rule 1. If you don't like or read romance, that's absolutely valid, but do not shit on anyone's preferences. Everyone is welcome.  
* Don't recommend a book that doesn't fit, no matter how much you like it. No, not even if it's your favourite.^6  
* If you don't have anything to recommend, upvote those who do rather than litter the thread with offtopic recs.  
* If you see someone rec something that doesn't remotely fit, in my experience, the best course of action is to gently (Rule 1!) call them out on it. Even if you won't convince whoever you're replying to, it helps the OP and it helps the bystanders.   
  
In addition, examine your own views. A few years ago I was the one looking down on romance, so this is personal experience. Think hard. Ask yourself *why*. Read outside of your comfort zone. If you want to write a book with a romantic subplot, do some research and read some romance or books with good romance subplots. I'm not going to say finding recs you'd like is easy, even without the barrier of people not knowing what romance is - I have friends who are experts and I still struggle.     
  
Romance should not be a dirty word. And we can all do better.

## Footnotes   
  
^(**1** And no, this is not a spoiler. If you have a mystery book, you know the mystery will be solved. If you have a romance book, you know characters will get together. It's a promise, the fun bit is the *how*. Journey before destination! :D)  
^(**2** See: the comparison with A Charm of Magpies below.)  
^(**3** *Coded*, deliberate phrasing there. By which I mean, stereotypically, romance is seen as something for women just as sci-fi is seen as something for men and fandom demographics would probably reflect that. Does it have to be? Are there no men who read romance and no women who read sci-fi? Absolutely not. However, sexism _does_ play a role in how genres are perceived and valued, and to say it plays no role in the way romance is disparaged, to say that romance is disparaged because it sucks would be moronic.)  
^(And just to skewer the bias once and for all, yes, romance has value. A lot of romance books I read recently have a lot of good things to say on consent and good communication. And even those that *are* mindless fluff - comfort and hope is value too. But others have written on this topic better and more eloquently than I. Essay-within-essay over.)   
^(**4** It honestly irritates me a lot that there's so many sloppy, half-arsed, forced-feeling romance subplots and so few fantasy books focusing on friendships, family, etc. Yes, falling in love is a common human experience, but not an universal one - aromantic people exist! - and *so are families and friendships.*)    
^(**5** Not nearly well enough by romance reader standards. Seriously. No chemistry whatsoever and little depth. I think the fantasy genre would be far better off regarding even the most minimalist of romance subplots if romance was more accepted and widely read.)   
^(**6** Not even if it's Malazan or Sanderson :P)",Fantasy

>J.R.R. Tolkien has become a sort of mountain, appearing in all subsequent fantasy in the way that Mt. Fuji appears so often in Japanese prints. Sometimes it’s big and up close. Sometimes it’s a shape on the horizon.

I’m best known for my “Legend of Drizzt” and DemonWars” series, and also for a couple of ventures into the Galaxy Far, Far Away…
(But we don’t talk about Chewy, no, no, no…)

My newest book, Glacier’s Edge,” was just released, and “The Dao of Drizzt,” the famous drow’s journal, will be released in September.

So here we go, Ask Me Anything and I’ll try to pretend I know the answer.


EDIT: Okay, got to run now for a bit. Have to finish this e-signing, give my little pup his medicine, and get ready for a softball game!

I'll try to get back to the rest later on, and thank you all for joining in and walking this road of adventure with me!

1596240916.0,The Name of the Wind: I don't get it.,"I just finished Patrick Rothfuss' The Name of the Wind, and I have to admit I'm flummoxed. A blurb on the back says to shelve it next to The Lord if the Rings as ""the first among equals"" which either speaks incredibly poorly about the reviewer's opinion of Tolkien, or of their qualifications as a reviewer.

I genuinely don't get the hype around this novel. Clocking in at a gargantuan 700 pages, the narrative goes approximately nowhere. Thinking over the book as a whole, I can't point to a single event of consequence that happens to the protagonist after the childhood tragedy that ostensibly starts his story. The tale, that portends to reveal the true story behind a legendary hero spends almost the entirety of its time on the world shaking question of whether or not the protagonist will be able to pay off his student loans. My hand to God, I wish I was making this up. The closest thing this epic fantasy novel, which has been heralded as the second coming of the genre, has to an ongoing conflict is predatory lending.

The author is talented, I suppose, but everything is dressed up in this tortured purple prose with pretentious of being literary despite the absolute absence of theme or plot. Much has been made of the world building but I found the world, it's politics, and level of technological development to be incredibly amorphous. Everything feels dull and static and  vague in a way that makes me wonder if the author himself even knows what any of the various countries, people, and cultures he tosses around are supposed to be.

And let's talk about this protagonist. Kvothe (pronounced like Quothe, because sure it is...) has got to be the author's DnD character or something, because Rothfuss LOVES him. He is a super skilled genius who is good at everything and, by the age of 15 is admitted to super wizard college on a special scholarship that no one else gets because of how clever and Joss Whedony he is. There is never a point where he faces an obstacle that he can't overcome with conveniently pre-existing knowledge. He is insufferably smug and good at everything and, despite the fact that the story sorta-kinda-maybe implies that at some point in the two books to come this arrogance will be his undoing, this volume does almost nothing to make Kvothe a sympathetic figure. Every character exists only in their relation to him. Every woman between fifteen and thirty flirts with him, despite his repeated claims (outright bald face lies) that he isn't good at talking to women, wise characters (with kind of one exception) exist to recognize and proclaim Kvothe's genius, and the primary antagonists are all comically stupid bullies who exists only to antagonize Kvothe for arbitrary reasons until he cleverly one ups them with all of his amazing skills. I would almost forgive all of the other issues I have with this book if the protagonist wasn't so deeply insufferable. He undergoes almost no meaningful change between the age of 11 where his story begins and the older, more jaded version of the character we see in the framing narrative. He remains a completely self assured insufferable know it all. I read most of the story thinking this older version of Kvothe, telling his story to a receptive chronicler, had to be in his fifties at the very least, but I was shocked to discover he was TWENTY-FIVE. It's such a bizarre choice given most of the story takes place when he is 15 and we are supposed to believe that somewhere in those ten years he becomes an almost mythological figure shrouded in legend and mystery. I can't. 

Imagine all of the worst elements of Harry Potter with 75% less plot progression and also Harry is a deeply punch able arrogant pissant for whom every subject is a breeze. That's basically the majority if this story.

I didn't write this to yuck anyone's yum. If you likes The Name of the Wind, that's okay, I just genuinely don't understand the hype.",Fantasy

Even original content gets complaints when there are Black characters.  There is never any explanation for why 90% of a fantasy or sci fi world is white despite the majority of the world being non-white. Nobody cares that the entirety of Avatar was Asian.  But if Black, there is immense backlash if not explained why they exist. I’m tired of the racist double standard and hypocrisy applying even to original content. People can suspend their disbelief for mythical creatures but not Black people. It’s honestly incredibly dehumanizing and reminds me that we haven’t improved as a society at all. I simply want to see women that look like me thriving in a world where we aren’t hated on sight.

Black people want escapism and fantasy stories of our own outside of slavery but the reason we have so few is because Hollywood studios only greenlight things that showcase slavery and overcoming oppression or poverty.  I’ve even had friends of mine on social media that work in animation and writing completely scrap original fantasy projects inspired by Caribbean mythology with a fully Black cast because of racist producers or backlash.",Fantasy

1582405609.0,The Definitive Scientific Guide to Eyebrow-Raising in Fantasy Fiction,"You all know what I'm talking about. A character cocks an eyebrow, or raises a sardonic brow, or arches an eyebrow. People like to joke about this when it's overused and since I'm a big ole nerd I decided to quantify exactly how often it happens and which authors like this trait best.

The results will shock and amaze you! Truly this is a study of critical and groundbreaking importance!

**Note: This is neither definitive nor scientific. I'm just doing this for fun. See the note near the bottom for real limitations in my methodology.**

Short Version: I tried to choose a spread of authors to cover different styles and subgenres. I searched the books in epub format, manually counted eyebrow raising, then divided wordcount by that number. Anything that means one eyebrow is getting raised was counted. Strikingly it's relatively uncommon for authors to describe eyebrows that AREN'T getting raised. I expected more physical descriptions and brow furrowing but they didn't appear much.

I'll lay out some notes later but I'll start with the numbers. The LOWER the number the MORE eyebrow-raising:

* Joe Abercrombie: 12,285
* Jacqueline Carey: Almost no single eyebrow raises, but 10,384 for both eyebrows raising
* Larry Correia: 14,125
* Steven Erikson: 6,000
* Robert Jordan: 9,838
* Guy Gavriel Kay: 54,000 single; 13,375 both
* Scott Lynch: 18,181
* George RR Martin: 88,500
* Patrick Rothfuss: 5,391
* JK Rowling: 128,500 single; 8,031 both
* RA Salvatore: See below
* Brandon Sanderson, MB: 4,037
* Brandon Sanderson, SA: 8,163
* NEW: Jim Butcher: 8,260 single; 10,738 both

&#x200B;

**THE NO EYEBROW CLUB**

* JRR Tolkien never has a character raise an eyebrow in LOTR. However every time eyebrows occur they are described as long or bushy (to be fair it's not many).
* Ursula Le Guin doesn't use eyebrow raising because NOBODY in Earthsea seems to have eyebrows. They're never described or referenced at all in the books I have.
* Robert E Howard likewise never once uses the word ""eyebrow"" in the complete Conan series.
* Robin Hobb uses eyebrow raises so rarely (like once or twice a book) that she gets to be an honorary member of the club.
* Salvatore has nearly no eyebrows in his early work (and zero eyebrow raises) but some later books have them in the 25,000-50,000 range.

**OBSERVATIONS**

* In the sample as a whole eyebrows were MUCH more likely to be raised than to be described in any other way.
* Raising both eyebrows at the same time is also not that common. Some authors never use this, some do rarely, and only three do frequently: Jacqueline Carey, Guy Gavriel Kay, and JK Rowling.
* The authors who like double raises like them a LOT. They're 80% of eyebrow appearances for Guy Gavriel Kay, 94% for JK Rowling, and 96% for Jacqueline Carey.
* If you count ""waggle"" then in some of Steven Erikson's books ALL uses of the word ""eyebrow"" are them being raised.
* Brandon Sanderson is the only other author to hit 100% eyebrow raising (in Mistborn 1). It was also rather repetitive overall, with the phrase ""raised an eyebrow"" accounting for 77% of all eyebrow raising. The exact sentence ""Kelsier raised an eyebrow"" occurs 14 times in the first book.
* I anticipated that some would object that Mistborn has a disproportionate number of writing tics so I also took numbers from Stormlight Archive. In it only 80% of eyebrow references were raising (actually lower than most authors on the list) and there weren't any phrases as commonly used. Average rate is still below 10,000.
* Patrick Rothfuss was the only person to challenge Sanderson on exact phrase repetition, with ""raised an eyebrow"" occurring 46 times in one book (62% of eyebrow raising overall).
* Robert Jordan was the only person in the entire sample who features eyebrows that droop expressively.
* NEW: By popular demand I added Jim Butcher to the bottom of the list! Early Dresden doesn't cock eyebrows so much but later books show it used frequently. What's unusual is that Butcher is the only author on this list to consistently use eyebrows in many categories. One book I analyzed completely was 41% single eyebrow raises, 31% double eyebrows, 12% other movements, and 16% neutral descriptions.

&#x200B;

**Methodology Notes**

The majority of the data was calculated by searching an epub version of the book and then tabulating by hand. In some cases where an entire series/author can be searched at once (like ASOIAF) I searched everything for more robust data. Other authors I take only one or two books as samples. I did experiment with testing more, but found that frequency of eyebrow raising was often consistent between books. If that isn't true for a given author, though, their data could be skewed.

I use the words/eyebrow method as an attempt to standardize, but it has limitations. Authors with a lot of back and forth dialogue are going to have more opportunities for dialogue tags than authors who write contemplative solo journeys. So it's an imperfect measure of frequency.

If any author uses ""brow"" in place of ""eyebrow"" then I might have underestimated their numbers. Expanding searches for ""brow"" would have included so many false positives it would have been a headache. Fortunately this seems rare from my preliminary testing.

&#x200B;

**THE THRILLING CONCLUSION!**

The implications of this study are profound. Racism, sexism, classism, grimdark, noblebright, postmodernism... these are words that have nothing to do with eyebrow raising. But if I've made you smile that's good enough. :P

Edit - The fact that so many other people have been amused by my little post warms the eyebrows of my heart! Thank you for the silver and gold, kind redditors!

Edit 2 - Well it seems like this silly post is going to be the peak of my Reddit career. I will continue to update the post and reply to data-based questions as I can!",Fantasy

Hi everyone!

My name is Mitch and I'm a small-time indie author who has today published the third and final book in my first-ever trilogy! I'm incredibly excited about it all, despite all the stresses along the way, and wanted to share the moment with you.

The Rising Saga is the story of three people who are brought together under the shadow of a war-mongering king who is driving his nation to the brink of disaster. Hopeful that together they can bring about an end to his reign and the iron fist he rules with. It's a story of friendship, loyalty, war, and betrayal.

Books 1 & 2 are currently free to celebrate book 3's launch today.

1646231344.0,RIP Priscilla Tolkien,"News [has sadly broken](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7703856341303488608/5403636253953328830#) that Priscilla Tolkien, the only daughter and youngest child of J.R.R. Tolkien, has passed away at the age of 92.

Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien was born on 18 June 1929 to John Ronald Reuel Tolkien and his wife Edith. She had three older brothers, John (1917-2003), Michael (1920-84) and Christopher (1924-2020). Her father read *The Hobbit* to her brothers as it gestated in the early 1930s, and later on to her before it was published in 1937. During the gestation of *The Lord of the Rings*, Priscilla helped her father by typing up some of the manuscript as it developed (Tolkien wrote his first drafts in longhand). Tolkien initially named the protagonist of the book ""Bingo"" after a stuffed bear Priscilla owned; he later changed it to Frodo.

Priscilla noted her father's ""complete belief in higher education for girls; never in my early life or since did I feel that any difference was made between me and my brothers, so far as our educational needs and opportunities were concerned.""

She gained a degree in English from Oxford University and worked as a social worker and probation officer. In August 1955, after Tolkien completed (at great stress) the revisions to *The Return of the King*, Priscilla took him on holiday to Italy, where he became enamoured of Venice.

After her father died in 1973, Priscilla was named as a board member of the Tolkien Estate. She became more active in the nascent fandom and scholarship surrounding her father's work. She contributed to the Tolkien Society and its periodicals *Amon Hen* and *Mallorn*, and served as the Vice-President of the Tolkien Society for many years (her later father is the President *in perpetuo*). She was a frequent guest at the Oxonmoot literary event.

Around 1977 she agreed to meet with Ralph Bakshi, who was producing an animated film based on *The Lord of the Rings*, and gave her approval to his concept art. The same year she gave a speech to celebrate the release of *The Silmarillion*: ""From my earliest years I recall my father telling me stories at bedtime, and in the darkened room as I was falling asleep I have a vivid memory of him retelling the story of Rapunzel and of how her prince sang to her at the foot of the tower where she imprisoned, telling her to let down her golden hair. This was brought back to my mind when reading the Tale of Beren and Luthien ... In *The Silmarillion* we have many shorter tales woven into one large tale of Creation and History ... It was possible for my father to conceive stories on both the grand and on the samll scale, and to have his imagination nourished by both the simplest fairy-tale and by great stories of the World.""

In 1992 she co-published *The Tolkien Family Album* with her brother John. She also took part in commemorations of the centenary of Tolkien's birth in the same year. Like most of the family, she offered no commentary on the success of Peter Jackson's **Lord of the Rings** film trilogy in 2001-03, but joined with the rest of the Estate in suing Warner Brothers for failure to pay royalties and trying to sell licences they had no right to, particularly related to gambling. After Christopher Tolkien's death in January 2020, she became the oldest and most senior member of the Tolkien Estate.

With Christopher Tolkien living in France for most of his life, Priscilla Tolkien became the more engaged of the family in the various fan groups and appreciators of her father's work. Well-known to be welcoming, charming and gracious, she will be missed.",Fantasy

It also just so happens that all three series are heavily fantasy oriented and have adapted and even expanded upon the world building of their source material in really compelling ways.

I've been quite disappointed with most modern fantasy adaptations in live action, but I hope that the success of these shows will encourage studios to put some big money into adapting some other beloved fantasy works from other mediums beyond video games in an animated format.

*EDIT:*   


*Just wanted to clarify some confusion about the OP.* 

1. *I'm not saying that Arcane, Castlevania and Dragon's Blood are the best fantasy adaptations by audience and critical consensus. I'm saying they're the best VIDEO GAME adaptations by audience and critical consensus. I feel like that's not particularly hard to prove.*
2. *I'm also not saying that animation is the ONLY WAY to adapt fantasy. Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, The Princess Bride, Stardust, Good Omens, American Gods, etc, etc, etc. all prove that it can be done well. I'm just saying that for magic heavy high fantasy, animation will allow the series to present the full scope and scale of both its magic and its world building, much more easily than live action would.*

It reminded me a little of Sting, so I found an hobbit to give you [an action shot as well.](http://imgur.com/a/cuc9Z)  

I'm deeply honored.  Many thanks again for all your enthusiasm.  If you've missed my previous AMAs, you can find two of them [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/k0fp8/iama_professional_fantasy_novelist_named_brandon/) and [HERE](
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ced7z/iamstilla_novelist_named_brandon_sanderson_ama/).  If you're curious about the progress on the third Stormlight Book, I've posted regular updates in r/Stormlight_Archive/. The latest is [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/5p4ydj/oathbringer_spoilers_stormlight_three_update_6/).

I'll likely be answering through the weekend, as is common for me.  I might not get to them all in a burst this time, as I have an interlude to write for Oathbringer, but I'll slowly work my way through the questions, in order, as I get them.  (Though I usually have to give a cut-off, to prevent the AMA from being eternal, so I'm going to promise to get to everything posted in the next four hours, ending around 5:15 Mountain Time today.  I might get to more, but that's my cut off point where I'm allowed to move on.)

If there's something I can't answer right now (because the answer would include spoilers, or because I don't REALLY want to spend hours searching through notes) I'll post RAFO, a phrase I inherited from Robert Jordan.   It means ""Read and Find Out"" or a more polite ""I worry that the answer might give away too much.""

(Warning to the cosmerenauts out there with very detailed worldbuilding questions: I won't outright forbid such questions, but this AMA is intended more for the general public of /r/fantasy, and I'd prefer more general interest questions.)

As always, I'm deeply grateful to you all for your support in this crazy thing that I do--and, in more expansive terms, I'm grateful for how you treat everyone on this subreddit.  It is one of the most welcoming places I've found for fantasy discussion.  There is not only great discussion, but respectful criticism.  I love how you treat newer authors, or writers who are lesser known as of yet. 

You're a great community and I'm happy to let you AMA. 

Brandon

EDIT:  Golden Stabby Thread [is over here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5t9ysg/brandon_sanderson_golden_stabby_award/)

For those wanting background, I asked to be recused from the Stabby awards for a little while, as I worried my presence on Reddit gave me an unfair advantage over other, equally worthy writers.  The mods came back and gave me this award instead--called a coup de grace award--intended to be for writers who topped too many stabby award lists, and needed to take a breather.  :)  

Also...should I be promoting something?  I never know.  Something something about Rampart.  I do have a new novella [coming out next week, though.](http://brandonsanderson.com/mgm-options-brandons-forthcoming-novella-snapshot/)

EDIT 2:  And...time!  Wow.  Over four hundred comments.

It could take me weeks to get through all of these, but I will do my best.  I'm hereby calling this enough work for me to take on for now.  I will work through these, keeping this page unrefreshed with all the comments on it, and try to answer everybody.  Four hundred is a little overwhelming, though, so be patient--and forgive me if some answers are short.  Thanks again, everyone!  ",Fantasy

It hasn't been **that** long. Mr. Wood was in *Sin City* not too long ago... right?""

And then I rememberd that *Sin City* came out in 2005, and felt old. :)

I remember seeing *Star Wars* when it came out. I don't remember the where's or when's for seeing the first installment of those two franchises, though. I never actually finished Potter's story in the theaters, I was content waiting for the DVD. I remember *The Return of the King*, because the best theater in Seattle had a marathon, where they played the director's cut of the first two movies and followed it with the premiere of the third, the day it came out, and we had to camp out in line practically overnight to make sure we could get in.

I feel super old saying this, but--Wow, you've grown! I think you had like 60k members when I joined. So first, for those who don't know me:

I am the r/Fantasy Stabby Award-winning author of The Night Angel trilogy and the Lightbringer Series. I wrote in obscurity for years as I finished my entire trilogy, and then my publisher gambled on a rarely tested approach, popularizing\[\*\](#s ""I won't quite say 'pioneered' it, though their success doing it with my books led to other publishers trying the same approach. The romance genre did rapid publication first, then Naomi Novik published normally in the UK (IIRC?) but then published rapidly--and very successfully--in the US."")

the rapid-publication-of-trilogies by putting out THE WAY OF SHADOWS, SHADOW'S EDGE, and BEYOND THE SHADOWS in consecutive months in late-2008. The books just kept going back to press, and THE WAY OF SHADOWS hit low on the New York Times bestseller list a full six months after publication. Since then, for the last 11 years, I've been writing the Lightbringer series (starting with THE BLACK PRISM and finishing with THE BURNING WHITE, out next week). It's been a mammoth undertaking, and I am so delighted that it didn't kill me. I mean, so delighted to share it with you.

Due to the twisty nature of my plots, it's hard to talk about my books without spoilers, so please do remember to hide those as appropriate. Check in that column ---> under #2 for instructions. After that, it's on readers themselves if they click spoilers. >!Brent dies at the end.!<

He bent down and pulled his willy out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.

---------------

**""Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this."" said Hermione, raising her willy.**

---------------

""EXPECTO PATRONUM!"" Harry yelled. Nothing happened. Harry gripped his willy tighter and shook it up and down until a thick, whispy white substance prtruded from the end of it.

---------------

**Then, with a sigh, he raised his willy and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.**

---------------

""No!"" roared Snape's voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his willy and panting.

1705922153.0,I’m a bit surprised by the relatively subdued response to the Hugo Awards scandal,"Maybe I’m just naïve, but I’m pretty shocked that the Hugos/Astounding Awards were so blatantly rigged this year (I’m sure it’s a barn fire among those actually involved in the process, but I haven’t heard much from the rest of us normal readers).

I’ve seen a lot of people saying that they don’t care about book awards anyway, but regardless of whether you personally care about awards, the Hugos are pretty clearly the biggest, most well-known award in science fiction and fantasy. Presumably it boosts books sales, brings recognition, leads to bigger future book deals, etc. At least, I always see “Hugo Award Winner” stamped pretty prominently on the covers of the winners, so it must have some real-world impact. And this year’s awards, at least, have been pretty clearly tainted.

I’ve just been learning about this as I’ve been reading what has become public over the past couple of days, so forgive me if I’m missing or misunderstanding anything, but this is what I’ve gathered so far (important to note that Worldcon, the annual convention of the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS), which organizes and presents the Hugos, was held in Chengdu, China this year, and was therefore exposed to potential pressure from the Chinese government):

* Several writers were declared ineligible for the awards with no explanation. Most of these are from the Chinese diaspora, including R.F. Kuang for best novel (Babel) and Xiran Jay Zhao (Iron Widow) for the Astounding Award for best new writer. Both should pretty clearly be eligible according to the posted criteria. And for the Astounding Award, new authors have two years of eligibility. Xiran Jay Zhao was already eligible last year, so it shouldn’t be possible for them to suddenly be ineligible this year.
* The nominating [stats](https://www.thehugoawards.org/2024/01/2023-nominating-and-final-ballot-statistics-published/), released a couple of days ago, seem fake or corrupted, especially for the awards for best novel and best series. Both have a huge drop-off between the works that were eventually nominated and the rest of the pack. Such a huge drop-off, in fact, that the results would require that the vast majority of the nomination ballots contained almost identical lists of books/series. This [blog post](https://alpennia.com/blog/comparison-hugo-nomination-distribution-statistics) explains it way better than I can
* The Chengdu Worldcon waited until the last possible day under the WSFS constitution to release the nominating statistics (90 days after the announcement of the winners), even though they are normally released within days. They should have had all the numbers already, so why wait, unless hoping the Hugos would pass out of the spotlight and the sketchy stats would get less attention?

I feel terrible for the “ineligible” authors and creators, who were unfairly blocked from receiving a potentially life-changing award. I feel terrible for the nominees and winners, who probably experienced one of the best moments of their lives, only to see these nominating statistics months later and realize that they won a devalued award through no fault or knowledge of their own. I feel terrible for victims we don’t even know who might have been nominated if not for the rigged process.

And the craziest thing to me is that there doesn’t seem to be anybody who can be held to account for this. Everyone just seems to be saying there’s nothing anyone can do, because each Worldcon is its own independent entity and there’s no central governing body. As a science fiction and fantasy fan I’d always just assumed the Hugos were legitimate awards, but if they’re able to be tampered with to this extent with no repercussions, they really shouldn’t exist! It seems to me that if you’re going to create and hand out awards, you have some kind of responsibility to ensure that the awards are fair. If the WSFS can’t ensure that, they shouldn’t be handing out their bogus awards, and should just shut the whole thing down so that legitimate awards can get more attention.

Anyway thanks for reading my rant, and feel free add any other shenanigans I’ve missed

- He *is* working on it.  

- It’s hard! But progress has been made and he sounds very upbeat.

- The books are different to the show, and getting even moreso.  *”Some things will be the same.   A lot will not.”*

- Some characters who die in the show will live in the books and vice versa.  

He also explains in some detail his “gardening” writing style and the impact it has had on his writing, and why it takes so long.   *”Things twist, things change, new ideas come to me (thank you, muse), old ideas prove unworkable, I write, I rewrite, I restructure, I rip everything apart and rewrite again, I go through doors that lead nowhere, and doors that open on marvels.”*

The presence of blacks, my teacher felt, changed the focus of a story, drew attention from the intended subject.

These are the first words of Octavia butlers powerful essay, ""The Lost Races of Science Fiction"". These words written in 1980 would make me think Ms. Butler could predict the future. Her words hit home today even greater when conversations of diversity are more readily had, but came from a a time when people rarely talked about diversity and representation to this extent. The biggest reason for me making this post is because people haven't read her or this wonderfully crafted essay. It was 1980 and it didn't make a splash in the lit world. Partly because it was in a magazine that was only published once and was ran by a teenager. Thankfully it was collected in a book recently so it's more easily available. 


 I've recently re read it and found a few parts so profound I wanted to share them and start a discussion. I'll include a link to the the entire essay at the bottom.

-----

>Science fiction reaches into the future, the past, the human mind. It reaches out to other worlds and into other dimensions. Is it really so limited, then, that it cannot reach into the lives of ordinary everyday humans who happen not to be white?

>Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Amerindians, minority characters in general have been noticeably absent from most science fiction. Why? As a black and a science fiction writer, I’ve heard that question often. I’ve also heard several answers. And, because most people try to be polite, there have been certain answers I haven’t heard. That’s all right. They’re obvious.

>Best, though, and most hopeful from my point of view, I’ve heard from people who want to write science fiction, or who’ve written a few pieces, perhaps, and who would like to include minority characters, but aren’t sure how to go about it. Since I’ve had to solve the same problem in reverse, maybe I can help.

>But first some answers to my question: Why have there been so few minority characters in science fiction?

>Let’s examine my teacher’s reason. Are minority characters—black characters in this case—so disruptive a force that the mere presence of one alters a story, focuses it on race rather than whatever the author had in mind? Yes, in fact, black characters can do exactly that if the creators of those characters are too restricted in their thinking to visualize blacks in any other context.

>This is the kind of stereotyping, conscious or subconscious, that women have fought for so long. No writer who regards blacks as people, human beings, with the usual variety of human concerns, flaws, skills, hopes, etc., would have trouble creating interesting backgrounds and goals for black characters. No writer who regards blacks as people would get sidetracked into justifying their blackness or their presence unless such justification honestly played a part in the story. It is no more necessary to focus on a character’s blackness than it is to focus on a woman’s femininity.

On the various writing subs and even reading subs we see people talk about black characters as being political and only write them if it's relevant to the story. Or if they see a character who's black they need immediate justification for that or else it takes them out of the story. 

She suggests that writers who have trouble giving black characters interesting backgrounds and stories, and writers who get sidetracked justifying “why” a character is black, are incapable of regarding black people as people. She compares this to the stereotyping that women have historically received and concludes, “It is no more necessary to focus on a character’s blackness than it is to focus on a woman’s femininity.” This is especially apt because of her double identity as a woman and a black person and how they intersect. 



>Now, what about the possibility of substituting extra-terrestrials for blacks—in order to make some race-related point without making anyone…uncomfortable? In fact, why can’t blacks be represented by whites—who are not too thoroughly described—thus leaving readers free to use their imaginations and visualize whichever color they like?

>I usually manage to go on being polite when I hear questions like these, but it’s not easy.

>Onward, then. Let’s replace blacks with tentacled beings from Capella V. What will readers visualize as we describe relations between the Capellans and the (white) humans? Will they visualize black humans dealing with white humans? I don’t think so. This is science fiction, after all. If you tell your readers about tentacled Capellans, they’re going to visualize tentacled Capellans. And if your readers are as touchy about human races as you were afraid they might be when you substituted the Capellans, are they really likely to pay attention to any analogy you draw? I don’t think so.

This is something I've felt but usually don't have the vocabulary to accurately explain. I've seldom met a ""racism but it's androids, elves, meta humans, aliens"" metaphor that didn't fall flat to me as a black person. Butler takes everything I've felt about it and puts it on display. It always made me feel like white people couldn't emphasize with me as a black person when I talk about racism and discrimination but could completely get it if it was an alien or fantasy race. 



>That brings me to another question I hear often at science fiction conventions. “Why are there so few black science fiction writers?” I suspect for the same reason there were once so few women science fiction writers. Women found a certain lack of authenticity in a genre that postulated a universe largely populated by men in which all the power was in male hands, and women stayed in their male-defined places.

>Science fiction writers come from science fiction readers, generally. Few readers equal few writers. The situation is improving, however. Blacks are not as likely as whites to spend time and money going to conventions, but there is a growing black readership. Black people I meet now are much more likely to have read at least some science fiction, and are not averse to reading more. 

She touches on a question that is still being asked. A question that ive asked too when I was younger. I think the growing readership gets more diverse every year year! I think that the more we get diverse readers we'll see diverse writers get more chances and properly compensated because the disparity between award winning and exceptional black authors and new and unproven white authors is too high. [This article about the viral hashtag  #PublishingPaidMe into the numbers] (https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/6/17/21285316/publishing-paid-me-diversity-black-authors-systemic-bias) 

>A more insidious problem than outright racism is simply habit, custom. Science fiction has always been nearly all white, just as until recently, it’s been nearly all male. A lot of people have had a chance to get comfortable with things as they are. Too comfortable. Science fiction, more than any other genre, deals with change—change in science and technology, and social change. But science fiction itself changes slowly, often under protest. You can still go to conventions and hear deliberately sexist remarks—if the speaker thinks he has a sympathetic audience. People resent being told their established way of doing things is wrong, resent being told they should change, and strongly resent being told they won’t be alone any longer in the vast territory—the universe—they’ve staked out for themselves. I don’t think anyone seriously believes the world of the future will be all white any more than anyone believes the present world is all white. But custom can be strong enough to prevent people from seeing the need for science fiction to reflect a more realistic view. 

>A second insidious problem is laziness, possibly combined with ignorance. Authors who have always written of all-white universes might not feel particularly threatened by a multicolored one, but might consider the change too much trouble. After all, they already know how to do what they’ve been doing. Their way works. Why change? Besides, maybe they don’t know any minority people. How can they write about people they don’t know?

Custom and laziness are two of the biggest reasons why science fiction and fantasy has been kept so monochromatic and from the outside looks so unwelcoming to anyone who isn't the standard white man. Customarily she makes the point of people getting comfortable and people get upset at being told their established way is wrong. It's why people need to keep speaking up when talking about diversity so the laziness problem doesn't cone into play where people get complacent and they won't do the thing all writers have to do research. Thankfully butler covers that too. 

>But what do authors ordinarily do when they decide to write about an unfamiliar subject?

>They research. They read—in this case recent biographies and autobiographies of people in the group they want to write about are good. They talk to members of that group—friends, acquaintances, co-workers, fellow students, even strangers on buses or waiting in lines. I’ve done these things myself in my reverse research, and they help. Also, I people-watch a lot without talking. Any public situation offers opportunities.

Thirty years later, Octavia Butler’s words still hold true. Science fiction is getting more diverse, but minority characters are still sorely lacking. Books written by straight white men still flood the market, many of which conveniently forget the existence of people who exist outside of this demographic. However, Octavia Butler would be pleased to know that there are more black science fiction writers today than there were in 1980. Take a look at N.K. Jemisin, opens a new window, who broke new ground in 2016 by becoming the first black author to win a Hugo Award for Best Novel!

I don't wanna put the whole article up because it wouldn't fit and because it deserves to be read in its entirety. But maybe my words aren't enough! Here's a few excerpts from reviewers talking about the essay. 


In her review for the Women’s Review of Books, Nisi Shawl writes about

Butler’s long out-of-circulation 1980 essay, “Lost Races of Science Fiction.” A manifesto about the erroneousness of excluding black characters from SF because of the “messiness” involved in depicting nonwhites, “Lost Races” ends with a half-jubilant, half-deploring assessment of science fiction’s attitudes toward inclusivity and prejudice. “Times have changed,” Butler decrees. In the next sentence, though, she admonishes the field that “it still has a long way to go.” That her pronouncements on this matter hold true nearly forty years after they were first published speaks volumes about the slow rate of social change and Butler’s continuing centrality to our understanding of the fantastic genres.

A review in Bookforum calls it “a blunt 1980 essay on the absence of nonwhite characters in the genre.”

1541640421.0,"Today, two years ago, I started writing a sci-fi/fantasy novel. Today, a Big Five publisher bought it as a debut in a three book deal.","I still remember sitting down in a Sydney city cafe, sometime in the afternoon, and writing the first chapter of what was going to be my next novel. I had some prior outlines and plot sketches, but Nov 8, 2016 was the day I started putting pen to paper. I kept plugging away at it until, in May 2017, I had a first draft.

Today, on Nov 8, 2018, Gollancz, the science-fiction and fantasy imprint under Orion Publishing, announced that they’d be buying STORMBLOOD as the first book in a contracted trilogy, for a planned release in hardback and trade paperback in Feb 2020.

Still wrapping my head around that. But suffice to say, I'm pretty stoked.

For those interested: the book is mash-up of space opera and adventure, about the DNA of an extinct alien race that’s used as a drug, making millions of people permanently addicted to aggression and adrenaline. The protagonist is a former a Reaper, biosoldiers injected with this drug to make them super soldiers, returns home from a major war to find his estranged brother is possibly involved in the distribution of this drug and murder of his fellow Reapers. He's still fighting his drug addiction, and as he gets deeper, the worse his body's urges become. Things only get worse from there. And then there's drug traffickers, cults, and intergalactic politics on the side. Its very character and voice driven, and is The Expanse meets Mass Effect.

I packed so many of my passions and themes I love exploring into this book, not because I thought they’d be selling points, but because I love them. I imagined a lot of things would work against me: its written in first person instead of 3rd or multiple PoVs, that having an addict protagonist would turn off certain audiences, that the space opera elements are low-key, more The Expanse than Star Wars. So it’s quite mind-boggling for it to get picked up by one of the leading SF/F publishers in the industry. There's more info on the book on their announcement page if you want it: [https://www.gollancz.co.uk/2018/11/06/acquisition-announcement-stormblood-by-jeremy-szal/](https://www.gollancz.co.uk/2018/11/06/acquisition-announcement-stormblood-by-jeremy-szal/)

It’s taken several failed novels over the course of several years, rejections from both agents and publishers, and thinking so many times it would never happen, but it’s finally happened and here I am. The book’s been through a dozen drafts, and the first chapter was heavily rewritten at the request of the publisher, but it’s fundamentally the same book and caked with the same DNA I envisioned it in.

So, I hope this also serves as encouragement for writers out there, especially the ones who feel like you’re not getting anywhere. Keep writing, keep growing, keep plugging away, keep looking for areas to improve in. If you do, in a year’s time from now you could have a polished, final draft of a novel. You could have signed with an agent. You could have sold a book to a major publisher. If you hit the right notes, there’s no reason why it can’t happen. It’s all about persistence. In this industry, the only thing you can completely control is your writing output. Take advantage of it.

So keep writing, keep editing, and keep submitting. And one day, you could easily be making a post like this yourself.

ETA: Well, this sort of blew up. Wow. Thank you all - your feedback and responses have made my day.

A few folks have asked me to remind them when the book comes out, so I'll say here that pre-orders are disproportionately helpful for new authors like me. They tell the publisher people are interested, and they give our books the extra push we need to survive. In the meantime, I've created the book on Goodreads, so feel free to add it to your pile so you don't forget: [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42683840-stormblood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42683840-stormblood)

Edit: since so many are still bringing up race swapping I thought I’d share my thoughts on it. Race swapping for me represents a bigger issue with the film/tv industry: that they still aren’t adapting much by poc authors and many races are still very under-represented (native/indigenous and asian actors, among others, are rarely chosen). Everything these days is remakes and spin-offs.

Name of the Wind is my favorite book. I'm not a big re-reader, but I think I've read it five or six times by now. I've lent it to nearly a dozen people, and added their names to the cover, back before the cover fell off. I notice something new every time I read it. I've spent hours puzzling over its mysteries, and managed to come to many of the fandom conclusions all on my own. I've spent time contemplating how the story ties together its many threads by being *about stories.* The phrases stuck with me, from 'the cut flower sound of a man waiting to die' to Sim's shy blue eyed smile. Wise Man's Fear made me think about riddles differently, about exploring for the sake of exploring. The women in the books made me think ""hey, where are all the good female characters?"" So. It's not all perfect.

But I love those books. And any time I read someone feeling hurt or betrayed or disappointed that Rothfuss hasn't produced a third one, it saddens me, because I've gotten so much out of them already. I get that people who loved these books have been waiting a long time and have gotten frustrated. I’ve been waiting too. But not all riddles have answers; not all stories have endings.

The first season is kinda bad, the animations are horrible, some characters are blank and the story is boring. But do not stop there because season 2 and 3 are MUCH better, the team did learn from their mistake and greatly improved. The blank characters became very complex and you will love them, the animations issues are fixed you won't have a problem with it anymore and the story is interesting.

Season 3 started jumping around to different characters (kind of like game of thrones) but it never felt jarring or out of sync. Also we finally saw Xadia with beautiful magical landscapes and an elven golden city. The characters arcs keep getting betters.

Netflix took the show for 4 more seasons, this mean that now the creators are sure not to be canceled and can start working on long term stories. Season 4 might come in 2021.

 I'm writing this in hopes of turning  more people to giving it a try. It doesn't get a ton of mentions and  talked about like other Netflix shows. I don't want Netflix to decide to  cut it like it did its superhero shows, before enough people find it  and give it the ol college try. I want this show to do well. They  listened to fans after season one and continue to push the series in a  great direction.

**Edit**: First off, thank you to everyone who read, upvoted, commented, and awarded this post - it means a lot! Secondly, I wanted to clarify what the point of this post was. It was not to say that all people described as 'swarthy' by Tolkien are meant to be imagined as dark-skinned. As several people have stated, 'swarthy' can refer to white people with dark hair and dark eyes, but it can also refer to people with dark skin, such as Tolkien's usage with the Haradrim. Rather, the point of this post was that you could easily interpret the use of the word as meaning dark-skinned, or you could interpret it as meaning the example above, or any other way you choose. Any interpretation is valid and has a precedent in the text, and we should not criticise people for their chosen interpretation. Thank you all for remaining civil and respecting one another.

&#x200B;

The release of the teaser for Amazon’s *The Rings of Power* has sparked further debate online about the future of the series, much of which is based upon rumours and unverifiable leaks. One of the most prominent debates concerns the inclusion of many actors from non-white ethnic groups in the cast. I’d like to here lay out why such criticism of the casting for a work set in Tolkien’s Middle-earth is unfounded, and why such claims as ‘there are already many roles for non-white actors in Middle-earth, like the Haradrim’ are, while well-meaning, missing the larger picture.

I am not the first to approach this topic, nor will I likely be the last. Reddit user u/rh_underhill made a case for [diversity in Middle-earth](https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/nr8ge5/a_case_for_a_some_diversity_in_the_books/), and u/LincolnMagnus examined the [case for non-white Hobbits](https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/qbppgk/concerning_nonwhite_second_age_hobbits_focusing/), coming to a very reasonable conclusion:

>I’m not saying there definitely, without a doubt, *had* to have been non-white hobbits in Middle-earth in the Second Age.  
>  
>What I’m contending is that we ought to leave space for fans to dream.

The sparsity of evidence concerning the Hobbits, coupled with u/LincolnMagnus’ thorough treatment, means I shall be focusing primarily on Men within Middle-earth, expanding upon the work of those before me.

&#x200B;

**The First Age**

Already in the First Age of Middle-earth, from both *The Silmarillion* and the *History of Middle-earth* series, we get a picture of the race of Men being rather diverse. There are, of course, the Edain, the first Men to come to Beleriand, and there are the Easterlings, those Men who came in the final decades of the First Age.

For those of you who might not know, the Edain are three ‘houses’ of Men that came to Beleriand. While the overarching term ‘Edain’, itself meaning Men, implies some form of shared culture or ethnicity, the three houses are distinct from one another (although they do become related through marriage ties, and there is no reason to suppose that there was not some mingling prior to their coming to Beleriand, there is certainly much after the Dagor Bragollach). Likewise, the Easterlings are distinct from the houses of the Edain, and are themselves what appears to be a general grouping of different tribes under one name (more on this below).

The first house of Men we are described is the House of Hador. They are described as being:

>“of great strength and stature, ready in mind, bold and steadfast, quick to anger and to laughter, mighty among the Children of Ilúvatar in the youth of Mankind. Yellow-haired they were for the most part, and blue-eyed”**^(1)**

Additionally, in *The Peoples of Middle-earth* it is said that of this house “all were fair-skinned”.**^(2)** Therefore, it is clear that the House of Hador are meant to be analogous with northern Europeans, with their blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin.

The next house of Men described in *The Silmarillion* is the House of Bëor.

>""The Men of that house were dark or brown of hair, with grey eyes; and of all Men they were most like to the Noldor and most loved by them; for they were eager of mind, cunning-handed, swift in understanding, long in memory, and they were moved sooner to pity than to laughter.”**^(3)**

We get a more in-depth description of the House of Bëor in *The Peoples of Middle-earth*:

>“There were fair-haired men and women among the Folk of Beor, but most of them had brown hair (going usually with brown eyes), and many were less fair in skin, some indeed being swarthy. Men as tall as the Folk of Hador were rare among them, and most were broader and more heavy in build.”**^(4)**

This is a rather interesting description of a people as it appears to be so diverse. It appears that there were some who were like the members of the House of Hador, fair-skinned and blond-haired, but there were also many more of a darker complexion with dark hair, and some even being ‘swarthy’ (more on this below). To me, this variation suggests that the House of Bëor might have been composed of peoples from various other tribes, perhaps having been adopted during the wanderings that brought them to Beleriand. However, there is nothing in the text to suggest this, merely my own interpretation.

Last among the Edain, we are described the People of Haleth, or the Haladin, and they are said to resemble the People of Bëor, albeit lesser in stature.**^(5)** Thus, of the three Houses of the Edain, the people of two are of a darker complexion, meaning that, even before the Easterlings came to Beleriand, there were many non-white peoples settled there.**^(6)**

The coming of the Easterlings means even more explicitly non-white Men arrive in Beleriand.**^(7)** They were:

>""short and broad, long and strong in the arm; their skins were swart or sallow, and their hair was dark as were their eyes. Their houses were many""**^(8)**

According to Merriam-Webster, sallow means “of a grayish greenish yellow color”, while its etymology is connected to Old English terms for ‘dark’ or ‘dusky’.**^(9)**  Similarly, ‘swart’ or ‘swarthy’, as is also used for some of the House of Bëor, means “of a dark colour, complexion, or cast”.**^(10)**  Etymologically, ‘swarthy’ is derived from the Old English *sweart*, meaning “black” or “dark”, and other words derived from the same proto-Germanic root word, such as German *schwarz* or Dutch *zwart*, also meaning black.**^(11)**  Thus, the Easterlings of the First Age, and some members of the House of Bëor, had dark skin that could conceivably be black. If not black, then they are still of a dark complexion, given how Tolkien used the same word to describe the Haradrim.**^(12)**

**Edit:** Tolkien uses 'swarthy' in his poem *The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun* to mean 'dark'. The phrase he uses is ""night-swarthy"" (IIX.18), likely a poetic way of saying 'black'.

Thus, we can see that there were plenty of Men in the First Age that could be considered non-white. Although, considering that Amazon’s *The Rings of Power* is going to be set in the Second Age, at first glance it appears that the ethnic character of the Men of the First Age would have little to add to discussions of that particular period of Middle-earth’s history. However, the Men of the First Age, and their migrations that brought them into Beleriand and onto the pages of *The Silmarillion*, had a great impact upon the character of later peoples of Middle-earth.

&#x200B;

**The Second Age and Beyond**

Firstly, and perhaps most importantly for *The Rings of Power*, the Númenóreans. The Númenóreans are the descendants of the Edain, who alone of the Men of Beleriand fought alongside the host of the Valar in the War of Wrath - other kindreds of Men instead fought for Morgoth and fled eastwards after his defeat.**^(13)**  Of course, the various houses of the Edain suffered many calamities and great loss during their time in Beleriand, causing their populations to mingle with one another. For example, the destruction of Dorthonion saw the House of Bëor leave their homes and instead take up residence among both the People of Marach and the People of Haleth.**^(14)** Thus, the population of Númenór is composed of a diverse group of people, with skin tones ranging from fair-skinned to swarthy.

This same ethnic diversity can be seen in Eriador. In *Peoples of Middle-earth* we are told that:

>“At that time the migrations of Men from the East and South had brought advance-guards into Beleriand; but they were not in great numbers, though further east in Eriador and Rhovanion (especially in the northern parts) their kindred must already have occupied much of the land”**^(15)**

Indeed, we are told that even after the Edain were settled on Númenór many of their kin remained in Eriador or wandered further eastward, settling between the Misty Mountains and the Sea of Rhûn, but always far from the coast.**^(16)** In Eriador, the people there are said to descend primarily from the House of Bëor, with some being descended from the House of Hador.**^(17)** Suggesting a diverse population which, just as in Númenór, had skin tones ranging from fair-skinned to swarthy. One Bree-lander is actually described as such, and in a way that suggests that he was not unique in his skin tone.**^(18)**

&#x200B;

[Middle-earth in the Third Age](https://preview.redd.it/nnm7cw52d0f81.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=68e43abe74fd76e692ea47e1f3bfedb8dd828862)

Further south, in Minhiriath, along the coasts south of the Ered Luin, was home to ""a few secretive hunter-folk"", and in Enedwaith there was ""a fairly numerous but barbarous fisher-folk"" in the Third Age.**^(19)** These people, and the Dunlendings further east, are kin of the House of Haleth, the House of Men from the First Age described as being similar to the House of Bëor.**^(20)**

Further south again, in the land that would become Gondor, there dwelt a ""short and swarthy folk among them whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed in the shadow of the hills in the Dark Years ere the coming of the kings”.**^(21)** Thus, if we see the Númenóreans in the land that would become Gondor in *The Rings of Power*, they will be mingling with 'swarthy' people, people with dark skin.

It has already been noted how some people of Eriador were descended from the House of Hador, but they are explicitly stated to be in the minority. Rather, it appears that people descended from the House of Hador appear to primarily be located east of the Misty Mountains. The Longbeards (that is, Durin's Folk), who controlled the Misty Mountains, the Grey Mountains, and the Iron Hills, were most associated with Men who were kin of the House of Hador:

>""These Men, it seems, had come westward until faced by the Great Greenwood, and then had divided: some reaching the Anduin and passing thence northward up the Vales; some passing between the north-eaves of the Wood and the Ered Mithrin. Only a small part of this people, already very numerous and divided into many tribes, had then passed on into Eriador and so come at last to Beleriand.”**^(22)**

The most famous of these people is the Rohirrim, also known as the Éothéod. A tribe of the Northmen the Longbeards associated with that dwelt in the Vales of the Anduin after having fled from the plains between Mirkwood and the Celduin, or River Running.**^(23)** Faramir relates that the wise of Gondor in his day noted the connection between the Rohirrim and the House of Hador.**^(24)**

&#x200B;

**A Mythology for England**

The most common argument against the casting of non-white people in certain roles in Middle-earth is the belief that Tolkien was creating a mythology for England. Tolkien was, initially, but gave up on the idea, calling it ""absurd"", as his legendarium grew.**^(25)** Had Tolkien continued to write a mythology for England, the argument goes that the peoples of Tolkien's legendarium would resemble English people, or the Anglo-Saxons that preceded the concept of 'English'.  However, he did not, and as u/LincolnMagnus says, ""If Tolkien, in 1951, had already let go of his dream of writing an English Kalevala, I'm not sure why we as fans should be beholden to it seventy years later.""

Of course, I am not telling readers how they should imagine Middle-earth, that is up to them. The reader can choose to interpret swarthy as meaning 'Mediterranean', or they can interpret it as black, or anything that they choose, it is entirely up to them. However, what I am telling readers is that they cannot criticise other people's imaginings of Middle-earth when there is a precedent in the text for whatever they criticise. Ultimately, *The Rings of Power* is Amazon's creation, it is their choice who they cast, they are not making their show to match someone else's ideas about Middle-earth.

I am sure the Peter Jackson trilogy is somewhat responsible for this understanding of Tolkien's world. The Jackson trilogy shaped how many modern readers visualise Middle-earth, and the Jackson trilogy cast white actors in most roles, particularly the most prominent ones. There is nothing inherently wrong with this. As I said, it was Peter Jackson's (or someone else involved with the production's) choice, and there was likely nothing malicious behind this casting, with the choices made most probably being driven by expediency.

If you have read this far, thank you. I hope I have made a strong case for the inherent diversity of Middle-earth, and that, while there may be issues with Amazon's *The Rings of Power* (issues raised from unverifiable rumours), the casting of a diverse group of people is certainly not one of them.

&#x200B;

**A Note on Black Elves**

While a bit off topic, I would like to add a brief note on the skin colour of Elves. Several comments on YouTube videos criticising *The Rings of Power* express concern over the possibility of black Elves, despite the fact that we have very few physical descriptions of Elves from Middle-earth. We primarily have descriptions of hair colour, eye colour, and temperament, not skin colour.

There is an instance in *The Silmarillion* that tells us that ""Of all Men they \[the people of Bëor\] were most like to the Noldor"".**^(26)** However, this quote does not tell us anything about the appearance of Elves, only that they were like the people of Bëor, who are said to be ""eager of mind, cunning-handed, swift in understanding, long in memory, and they were moved sooner to pity than to laughter"".**^(27)** Yet, elsewhere we are told that ""the Eldar said, and recalled in the songs they still sang in later days, that they \[the people of Bëor\] could not easily be distinguished from the Eldar - not while their youth lasted, the swift fading of which was to the Eldar a grief and a mystery”.**^(28)** Thus, the Eldar themselves said that they resembled the House of Bëor, who themselves were fair-skinned and darker, some being even 'swarthy'. Black Elves are certainly not inconceivable.

The compassion on them. The tolerance, the antimilitarism, the sheer acceptance of others. The love for diversity. I had never seen this kind of message translated so masterfully. The tragedy of war.

""It's impossible to truly understand someone and not love them. Even your worst enemy."" Hot damn.

And then I found about Orson Scot Card, and as a LGBT person... dude.

I mean, I'm familiar with not liking the author of your favorite book. Bad people can write good stories and all of that. But this guy...

It's like he never understood his own words at all. As if he never read his own books, even more wrote them. I'm completely astonished. How can you write a treaty abou tolerance and love like that and just... treat people like that? To the point of actively taking the money you made off your book about love and use it to take away people's rights.

The message of the book is that we should strive to understand diferent points of view. So my dude, you're saying you're ok with aliens murdering people, they must be forgiven because they didn't know what they were doing. But real human beings loving someone of the opposite sex, that's too far...

1615137960.0,You can like hard AND/OR soft magic systems! THEY'RE BOTH GOOD!,"I've seen more than a couple of posts in the last few days in which people are having this fight over types of magic systems again and it drives me crazy. Look, I'm a huge hard magic system fan, and I love Sanderson books, but that isn't the only way to write fantasy, and anyone who says it is the *best* way is *probably* not reading widely enough and sticking to their Sanderson-McClellan-Weeks-etc. circle of authors. And on the flip side, I can love a good soft magic system, but just because it doesn't have rules doesn't make hard magic systems highly mechanical and lifeless! It just means you have your own tastes for what you like, and that's okay.

For this post I'm going to be using Brandon Sanderson's definitions of hard and soft magic systems. I'm using them because he was really the one to coin and popularize these terms in discussions of magic in fantasy, and because they are very precise and refer to VERY specific effects. I can't actually find you the specific moments in videos where he talked about these definitions, because that would take me ages and I would rather get this post done in the next half hour so I can sleep, so if you guys don't trust me I invite you to go look for those quotes yourselves, or else don't partake. But essentially, he defines these as follows:

**Hard Magic System**: A magic system in which the *reader* understands *most* of the costs/limitations/abilities in the magic system, and the magical activities in the story mostly work within the bounds of that understanding to get things done.

**Soft Magic System**: A magic system in which the *reader* does *not* understand *most* of the costs/limitations/abilities in the magic system, and the magical activities in the story work beyond the bounds of what the reader understands to do the magic.

You'll notice that these don't actually refer to whether the magic ultimately has rules or not, but whether the reader knows these rules. This is because, at least in Sanderson's view (and I understand that this can be debated), a magic system that operates on a lot of rules, but where the reader doesn't know the rules at all, can have the same effect as a magic system without many rules at all. He often cites *Lord of the Rings* for this, where people who have read *The Silmarillion* will be a lot more aware of the powers and limitations of someone like Gandalf, but if you only read *Lord of the Rings*, you'll experience it as a wondrous soft magic system. Another example is the Lord of Light magic in ASOIAF—there's clearly rules about what that magic can and can't do (because they can't just burn all their enemies with it with a flick of the wrist or whatever), and we do learn a couple of these rules, but for the most part we have no idea how it works and so it's a scary primal sort of magic that is exciting to see in the story.

Anyway, I would ask that you accept these definitions if only so we can get into the more interesting discussions below.

So I'm approaching this as a fan of both hard and soft magic systems. I think I enjoy reading hard magic system stories more overall because I enjoy seeing characters use magic to deal with conflict, but a) that is definitely possible to do with soft magic, and b) I've definitely enjoyed a lot of other types of soft magic stories as well. I want to get into some of the merits of both hard and soft magic systems, and I think I'll start with soft magic systems. Obviously, there are some things like a sense of wonder and stuff which soft magic systems are better at, but I want to dig specifically into what it can do on a technical level for a story.

**Soft Magic Systems**

1. A soft magic system can be a great source of conflict. While yes, a magic-user in a hard magic system can create conflict by being the opponent to the protagonist, a soft magic system can actually create conflict on its own. Perhaps, inexplicably, your soft magic system causes environmental problems every time someone tries to use it to do something—like you ask for a wish, but then there's an earthquake, or a wildfire, or something else. And maybe the thing you want to do is always done with some kind of an unpredictable twist, so you wish for someone to die, but inexplicably, that person comes back to life as a zombie and starts infecting everyone. This is kind of a silly random example I made up on the spot, but the point is, soft magic systems can create all sorts of conflict in your world.
2. A soft magic system can create awesome character moments. One of the things I loved about *Book of the Ancestor* was that the magic's limitations were never super clearly defined. The full extent of what the different magic systems could do was very vague, and we were supposed to buy the characters doing awesome things by trusting in their skill level. What this allowed Mark Lawrence to do in the story was that he could do all kinds of different things with his magic that hadn't been set up or shown before, but it was completely and 100% believable because we always bought that the character could/would do this with their skill and knowledge level. Similarly, in Harry Potter, we saw tons of instances where Harry or another character would use a spell we had never seen before to resolve a conflict, but we could believe that they had learned said spell because of their progress through Hogwarts at the time (and we see a lot more of this in later books, when they are a) in higher grades and b) more experienced in conflict).
3. A soft magic system can create deep fear. Besides a sense of wonder, which I already said in the paragraph before this list, soft magic systems can evoke a sense of fear which hard magic systems can't very easily. This sort of emotion thing, by the way, is something that soft magic systems are far better at overall, because when you don't really understand something, it's a lot easier to have it evoke emotion than when you do really get it. I'd say the best examples of scary soft magic are all in *A Song of Ice and Fire* where you have an all-you-can-eat-buffet of soft magic systems that are all kind of scary and things you want to stay far far away from. Similarly, even *The House in the Cerulean Sea* has this: >!We're never fully aware what Lucy is capable of with his Antichrist magic, and this is used to scare the reader, particularly when Lucy is having that nightmare and Linus and Arthur have to calm him down.!< Even in this wholesome story, we see a soft magic system being used to scare the reader.

**Hard Magic Systems**

1. This is gonna be controversial, but based on these definitions, every hard magic system starts as a soft magic system, because your reader doesn't understand the rules, and you can create a lot of story progression out of your characters learning about the rules of the system and exploiting those rules more and more to solve conflict. I'm currently in book 2 of the *Mage Errant* series by John Bierce and this is exactly what this story is doing—at the beginning of book 1, the characters can't use magic at all, and as we go through, we learn more and more about the sources of magic, the limitations of magic, and the different abilities that characters have and can unlock, and we get a lot of story progression out of seeing them grow in their abilities. The same thing is accomplished in *The Stormlight Archive*, where the magic is actually pretty soft through book 1 and much of book 2, and it isn't until near the end of book 2 where we see the characters have learned enough rules to start calling the magic ""hard"" and where they can exploit the rules to solve conflict. And this is one of the things that makes magic in Stormlight really fun, where we unlock more knowledge of the magic in every book, and yet we can see that there's still a ton more left for us to learn as the story goes on. So it's not just a mechanical, simulationist system—it's engaging to the reader because we are always learning about it. Your magic system **learning curve** is the rate at which the reader learns the rules of the magic (even if characters already know the rules, the reader still has to learn them).
2. A hard magic system can affect worldbuilding in complex and technical ways. If your magic system is like a tool or a weapon, and can be used consistently (as hard magic can), then your society is undoubtedly going to be affected in deep ways, at least on an economic and cultural level, if not political and social as well. Think of *The Sword of Kaigen*, where bloodlines guard their special magic techniques closely, or *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, where different Nations with different forms of bending have adapted their cultures and philosophies to their bending styles. Think of *Warbreaker*, where everyone has a Breath which is traded for on the market, and where citizens are forced to donate Breath to the gods to keep the gods alive, or *Powder Mage*, where hard magic using powder mages clash with elemental soft magic using Privileged across the world in many different countries. The point is, while soft magic systems do affect worldbuilding in important ways, hard magic systems can be ingrained into the fabric and pulse of society in ways that soft magic systems can't.

And there's more to say for both of these, but I'll leave it at that. As you can see, I read more hard magic system stories than soft magic system stories, because that's more where my interests lie and more of what's being published today, but I do try to seek out soft magic systems occasionally to read about, because those stories are always great (and feel free to recommend some to me! I've already got a bunch on the ol' TBR, but always looking for more!).

But all of this being said, I want to close with this: **both of these types of magic systems are great.** The tone of some of the posts I've seen on this subject has been strangely combative and defensive, where those who prefer soft magic are talking about how hard magic systems feel dull and lifeless and mechanical (which is perfectly fine if you feel that way), and they don't understand how people can enjoy them (preferences), while those who prefer hard magic systems are talking about how soft magic systems solve all the problems with little to no explanation (they don't, they usually create more problems than solve them, and if they do deus ex machina like this, that's bad writing, and I've seen this WAY more in hard magic stories than in soft magic stories anyway) or are all the same (literally read *A Song of Ice and Fire* or watch *Game of Thrones*, or read *Book of the Ancestor*—there's a thousand ways to make them unique).

In my opinion, this is a dumb thing to fight about, because it's so down to individual preference so what's the dang point? Let's go back to gushing about Robin Hobb please.

Edit: I should add, I tried to use more popular stuff as examples here because more people would be familiar with them. Sanderson tends to be a go-to example for hard magic of different types, but I tried to branch out to other ones that people would be familiar with to different degrees.",Fantasy

So since I disliked the other end of the spectrum, I jumped to the other end. But now days I like something that is in the middle, and more towards the lighter side.

The lightweight banter between friends, the humor that carries the light tone through the book even if there are bad things happening is what keeps me interested. When the book is all depression and grim and dark it does not keep me interested. I want the main character to succeed, I want them to be someone I like, I want to empathize with them but also I want them to be someone I would actually like to be friends with, someone who I can root for. It just creates a better connection, makes me care about the main character. Makes me invested in what happens to them.

And mythical and folk lore style fantasy elements in the story create this magical atmosphere, like the world itself is not ordinary but is magical. Like in ""His dark materials"" trilogy. Even thought that book has serious themes and sad things happen, the world in which it happens in has this mystery to it, it is a world of myth and magic. Same with Harry Potter.

I sometimes see people talking badly about ""childish"" books. I read a comment here that said that Joe Abercrombie's books are not childish but realistic and that is why they dont have a happy ending to them and that if you want those kind of books look at the children section of the library.

But to me childish to a certain extent is actually good. I dont know why ""childish"" is so often only used to relay a negative opinion of a book. There is a certain very comfortable vibe to ""childish"" books or books that are written for a younger audience. I dont think that all books that are also written for a more mature audience need to get rid of this vibe and be all serious and adult and dark with characters that are all bad people and where no one wins at the end.

# Epic Fantasy

* [**The Rage of Dragons**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41952489-the-rage-of-dragons?from_search=true) **by Evan Winter** \- This is one of those ""out for revenge"" type stories that get better and more complicated as it goes on. It's set in a Xhosa-inspired world that has a rigid caste system, a never-ending war, and yes, dragons. This world is also parallel to another world where demons roam the planet. If you ever liked **Red Rising** by Pierce Brown, and wished for a more fantasy-ish equivalent, this will scratch that itch. High-action all the way through.
* [**The Wolf of Oren-yaro**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36640276-the-wolf-of-oren-yaro?ac=1&from_search=true) **by K.S. Villoso** **-** There are few people who can pull off character-work like Villoso can. A queen known to some as the ""she-wolf"" leaves her struggling country to meet with her estranged husband, and the father of her son. Shit then hits the fan. We follow Tali as she fights for her country, and for survival.
* [**Age of Assassins**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33296298-age-of-assassins?ac=1&from_search=true) **by R.J. Barker** \- Okay, look, I know the word ""assassins"" is right there, and yeah Girton is technically an assassin, but this isn't the kind of book you might think it is. There's no sulking, silent badasses here. Girton is vulnerable. He largely does what his master tells him to do. He struggles. And the book and series are so much better for that.
* [**Lost Gods**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34804767-lost-gods?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Micah Yongo** \- What we have here is a multi-POV epic fantasy in a world with a brotherhood of assassins, which is shaped by the feel and wisdom of West African folktales and is laced through with conspiracies, betrayals, and the supernatural. Sounds pretty good, right?
* [**Empire of Sand**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39714124-empire-of-sand?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Tasha Suri** \- A wonderfully written Mughal Indian inspired fantasy. Tasha Suri’s writing style is beautiful and evocative. She has a talent for navigating the structures, quirks, and happenings of her world in a way that never neglects the emotional response of her characters. And speaking as someone for whom romances are more miss than hit... the romance here is sweet, complicated, and beautiful.

**Honourable Mentions:** [The Sword of Kaigen by ML Wang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41886271-the-sword-of-kaigen?ac=1&from_search=true), [Master & Mages by Miles Cameron](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30344847-cold-iron?ac=1&from_search=true), [City of Lies by Sam Hawke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36225135-city-of-lies?ac=1&from_search=true), [A Time of Dread by John Gwynne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34392663-a-time-of-dread?ac=1&from_search=true), [Master of Sorrows by Justin Travis Call](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39308821-master-of-sorrows?ac=1&from_search=true), [The Winter Road by Adrian Selby](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39088527-the-winter-road?ac=1&from_search=true)

# Urban Fantasy

* [**The Girl Who Could Move Shit With Her Mind**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41155087-the-girl-who-could-move-sh-t-with-her-mind?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Jackson Ford** \- What a fucking title, right? You'll be happy to know that it fits the book like a glove. What we have here is a story about a snarky woman with telekinesis, and a whole lot of shit going flying through the air.
* [**Paternus: Rise of Gods**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35621572-paternus?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Dyrk Ashton** \- The way I always pitch this one is... ""what if all of the myths and religious figures in our world were real?"". All of them. Imagine you could have Hercules fighting the literal devil. Norse gods battling with Hindu gods. Well... Paternus has all of that. And it's brilliant.
* [**Nice Dragons Finish Last**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20426102-nice-dragons-finish-last?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Rachel Aaron** \- This is the kind of book you read when you're looking for something optimistic. A goody-two-shoes character that isn't demonised for trying to be good. A dragon that doesn't fit the mould for what a dragon is supposed to be, but fights through that prejudice to just... be nice. It's simply written, and some of the series gets a little repetitive, but it's great. The audiobooks in particular.
* [**Magic for Liars**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34594037-magic-for-liars) **by Sarah Gailey** \- A bit of a strange book. It's slow paced in the extreme, and overflowing with mundane description. I'm talking ""a few sentences to describe a hand on a doorknob"" stuff. And yet... The level of description did mean that it took me a while to fully immerse myself in the book, but when I did, I really *was* immersed in the main character and her story. I've a love for broken things, and this is a story about a broken person trying to mend a broken relationship with her twin sister, against the backdrop of a magical murder mystery.

**Honourable Mentions:** [Jade City by Fonda Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43587154-jade-city?ac=1&from_search=true), [The Imaginary Corpse by Tyler Hayes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42873309-the-imaginary-corpse?ac=1&from_search=true), [Amberlough by Lara Elena Donnelly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939270-amberlough?ac=1&from_search=true)

# Grimdark

* [**Priest of Bones**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37884491-priest-of-bones?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Peter McLean** \- This is basically magical Peaky Blinders. And it's every bit as fucking good as that sounds. The voice in this one is just so infectious, you'll find your inner-monologue speaking like Tomas Piety for days. It's dark, brutal, brilliant.
* [**We Ride the Storm**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39781307-we-ride-the-storm?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Devin Madson** \- I've yelled about this book on here a lot. One of the best self-published books I've ever read. Three characters, all in first-person, all struggling to survive in a world with so much violence and politicking that it just won't leave them at peace.
* [**The Poppy War**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068705-the-poppy-war?ac=1&from_search=true) **by R.F. Kuang** \- Drop a tab of acid, call the gods, burn every fucking one of your enemies to a crisp. That's basically how this goes. Of all the books here, this is probably the darkest. Based on some of the darkest points of Chinese history, it doesn't shy away from any of the shit that actually happened in real life. A hell of a book.
* [**The Court of Broken Knives**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32469783-the-court-of-broken-knives?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Anna Smith Spark** \- Talk about an infectious voice. The Court of Broken Knives is stylized to a fucking ridiculous level, and I mean that as a compliment. So much violence. So much fucked-up shit. Characters that are fucked in the head. And through it all: Death. Death. Death.

# High-Concept Fantasy

* [**This is How You Lose the Time War**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36516585-this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone** \- Cards on the table, one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. It's basically a love story. No, scratch that. It's basically the best love story of the past few years. Two time-traveling operatives of two enemy factions meet throughout the centuries, and re-write history just for a chance to talk to each other. Dueling POVs, dueling perspectives. Or maybe not.
* [**The Ingenious**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40531014-the-ingenious?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Darius Hinks** \- I don't even know where to begin explaining this one. Crazy shit happens to crazy people. Go read the blurb and a few of the reviews. It's insane. It's great.
* [**The Gutter Prayer**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39836383-the-gutter-prayer) **by Gareth Hanrahan** \- A girl, a ghoul, and a stoneman walk into a bar. The bar explodes. A god shows up and kicks the shit out of all them, then a policeman dressed up as a candle shows up and they all run away because those tallowman bastards are *scary*. A fucking excellent book.
* [**Shadows of the Short Days**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40041298-shadows-of-the-short-days) **by Alexander Dan Vilhjálmsson** \- A translation of the Icelandic fantasy novel ""Hrimland"". What we have here is a revolution on the go, with a half-elf who wants to tear down the government, and a mad wizard who wants as much power as it is possible for him to hold. It doesn't shirk away from exploring the nasty side of revolutions. It doesn't shirk away from much at all. It's not really like anything else I've ever read before.

**Honourable Mentions:** [The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43521657-the-ten-thousand-doors-of-january?ac=1&from_search=true), [Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42036538-gideon-the-ninth?ac=1&from_search=true), [Foundryside by Robert Jackson Bennett](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37173847-foundryside?ac=1&from_search=true), [The Ninth Rain by Jen Williams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29758013-the-ninth-rain?ac=1&from_search=true)

# LitRPG

* [**Death March**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39980416-death-march) **by Phil Tucker** \- If ""bingeable"" was a word in the dictionary, the cover for this book would be the picture they'd use. Not too heavy on the stats, but they're definitely there. A standard ""guy ends up in a video game that turns out to be real"" plot, but so, so fun.
* [**Stuff and Nonsense**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37654736-stuff-and-nonsense) **by Andrew Seiple** \- A LitRPG from the perspective of a teddy bear golem. It can't speak. It can't really do much of anything, to be honest. But it stumbles from situation to situation, levelling up as it goes. An incredibly fun book. In my opinion, the sequels aren't as good, but this one at least is hilarious, charming, and just plain worth reading. Also, Tim Gerard Reynolds reads the audiobook.
* [**The Wandering Inn**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41033158-the-wandering-inn) **by Pirateaba** \- This one is a web-serial, but it's a great web-serial. Erin finds herself in a world that runs based on the laws of a videogame, only to the inhabitants this is just how the world has always worked. Does she use her video game knowledge to take over the world? Does she fight evil? No. She opens an inn and starts selling pasta.
* [**Forever Fantasy Online**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204341-forever-fantasy-online) **by Rachel Aaron & Travis Bach** \- A similar premise to Death March (a LOT of LitRPGs use the same tropes) but perhaps slightly darker, and with more than one POV. Worth reading just for that one dude who gets stuck in his big-tittied cat avatar body.

**Honourable Mentions:** [New Game Minus by Sarah Lin](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42847216)

# Fairytale/Mythical Fantasy

* [**The Bear and the Nightingale**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489134-the-bear-and-the-nightingale) **by Katherine Arden** \- An incredibly atmospheric book set in medieval Russia, following a girl with a touch of magic in her as the natural magics fade away with the introduction of Christianity. Some of my favourite prose in the genre.
* [**Spinning Silver**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36896898-spinning-silver) **&** [**Uprooted**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22544764-uprooted?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Naomi Novik** \- two books inspired by the stories of Rapunzel and Rumpelstiltskin. Novik moulds these inspirations with some fantastic world-building to create atmospheric books with strong women characters that you want to root for.
* [**Brightfall**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41946234-brightfall) **by Jaime Lee Moyer** \- Okay, so what if Maid Marian was a witch and Robin Hood was a bit of a prick? And what if there was a curse on all Robin's old mates, and Marian had to fight her way through fae-infested Sherwood to find the cause? That's Brightfall.
* [**Under the Pendulum Sun**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34643773-under-the-pendulum-sun) **by Jeannette Ng** \- This book is just so well written, and explores the fae-realm in a way that leaves you feeling so incredibly uncomfortable. A sister travels to the world of the fae to meet her brother, who is attempting to convert them to christianity. When she arrives, her brother is not there, and all she has are the members of his household for company. Slow-paced and spooky.
* [**Yarnsworld**](https://www.goodreads.com/series/193808-yarnsworld) **by Benedict Patrick** \- These books are almost like a revival of the Brothers Grimm, but with original worlds moulded based on fairytales and myths from our world, and Patrick's imagination. You can pick these up in basically any order, and while the first one is notably the weakest, they're all pretty great.

# Science Fiction

Yeah, yeah. ""It's not fantasy"", I know. If you don't like it, you can just skip over this part. If you want even more great books though, I'd pay attention.

* [**Anything**](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8389735.Becky_Chambers) **by Becky Chambers** \- Seriously. The Wayfarer's series won a Hugo for a reason. These are THEE books you read if you're having a bad day. They never fail to make me feel better. High-concept sci-fi with aliens and lots and lots of feelings.
* [**The Vela**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43472049-the-vela?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Serialbox** \- This is a serialized story about a solar system with a dying star, and a conspiracy revolving around a missing refugee ship. Rather than tell you any more, I'm just gonna list the INSANE list of authors that worked on this: S.L. Huang, Becky Chambers, Rivers Solomon, and Yoon Ha Lee.
* [**Rosewater**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38362809-rosewater?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Tade Thompson** \- A recent winner of the Arthur C. Clark award, and for a reason. This book is fucking good. A ""biopunk"" story about an alien dome that turns up in Nigeria with mysterious healing powers, and about a man who can read minds, but still can't understand humans. A masterclass in worldbuilding.

# Assorted Other Stuff to Read Anyway

* [**Undoing of Arlo Knott**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46822913-the-undoing-of-arlo-knott?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Heather Child** \- Dude basically has an ""undo button"", and we learn how using this shapes his life, who he is, and those around him.
* [**Orconomics**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25326486-orconomics?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Zachary Pike** \- A comic fantasy that plays with the concept of hunting monsters and other ""evil creatures"" for gold, and the subsequent financial nonsense that follows when you base your entire economy around such a fucking stupid thing.
* [**Nevernight**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114463-nevernight?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Jay Kristoff** \- Stabby girl stabs lots of people and gets stabbed in turn, in all senses of the word. Smutty violent fantasy with a talking cat-of-shadows that is snarky as fuck.
* [**The Black God's Drums**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38118138-the-black-god-s-drums?from_search=true) **by P. Djèlí Clark** \- A fucking incredible novella. Amazing worldbuilding. My only complaint is that I wish it were a full-sized novel.
* [**Miranda In Milan**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39947822-miranda-in-milan?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Katharine Duckett** \- An F/F (or maybe bi) novella that reimagines the consequences of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Slightly strange, slightly unsettling, but very sweet. The writing flows like beer at a stag party.

Aaand, well. That's it. Here are nearly 50 great fantasy books for you to kill your TBR with. Not all will be to everyone's tastes, so click away and those Goodreads links and see what seems up your alley!

I'm aware that I may have made typos, or that things might not strictly be in the correct subgenres, or that I haven't mentioned <this thing> or <that thing> in my descriptions, or that X or Y deserves more than being ""just an honourable mention"", but hey... otherwise it was just gonna look even more like a big ol' list of bullet-points.

I've tried to keep this to authors that don't get much talk on this sub, and to keep it to more recent releases, so hopefully there's something up there that spikes your interest and that you haven't read before. Happy reading!",Fantasy

1624714092.0,It saddens me that some of the best fantasy novels won't be read by many people.,"I'm a Swedish Fantasy author. My first novel got published last year, written in swedish. I'm also a big lover of fantasy books since childhood. Here in Sweden, fantasy isn't a big genre like in the Anglo-American world. Not from lack of readers, but from the lack of interest from the big publishing houses. Crime novels are king here in Sweden. The big genre. The one that every swede and their cat reads. Feelgood has a pretty big precence as well, as long with romance and non fiction. The fantasy books that sell in many copies here are mostly translated from english. Despite this a small but dedicated band of authors, book fans and small publishing houses have begun to write, read and publish swedish fantasy novels. I am one of the authors. As the scene is small, we support each other as authors, and as fans. 

Having been on this scene since 2015, I've noticed that many of the swedish fantasy novels are of really high quality. I'm talking Brandon Sandersson, Joe Abercrombie, Robert Jordan, Scott Lynch etc kind of quality. I'm reading a book right now, ""Skärvor av en brusten värld"" (Shards of A Broken World) by swedish author Matias Kuldkepp. His book is a 10/10 Masterpiece. Easily one of the best books I've ever read. If Kuldkepp was english/american, and famous, he would be hailed as the new Sandersson. And he deserves to become famous. His books deserves to become world wide bestsellers. Instead his books will be sold in a few hundred copies at most, and wont be translated to english, since that is expensive for a small time author to afford. And since agents only want to get the publishing rights for books that's allready famous in their home countries, that is a really hard problem. It is the same thing with another swedish fantasy trilogy I've been reading since 2016. The last part came out this year, really high quality. With an awesome story, world and characters. 

I don't know what to do about this. Obviously I'm partial as an author myself. I want the swedish fantasy novels to succeed as much as possible. I dream of them becoming translated by a big, english/american publishing house some day. Not only my own novel and the sequels I'm writing, but every good swedish fantasy novel. Simply put you english/american/world wide readers good in english don't know what you are missing! I'm feeling frustrated and just want to went. If people have soutions that would be awesome. If people are understanding that's equally good.",Fantasy

1541709675.0,Wizard's First Rule Rant,"Sorry about this, but... I had to. I had to. If you care to read on you'll understand.

A couple people who pay really, really close attention to r/fantasy posts may recall that a while ago I was given a copy of Wizard's First Rule by Terry Goodkind. I was, umm, hesitant to read it, from what I'd heard, but I just proceeded to tell myself that it surely couldn't be that bad - they say it doesn't get worse until the later books anyway, right?

Holy shit. Just... holy shit. I did not realize.

I mean, it started off on a decent note. Cliched, yes, but noble country boy teams up with a badass wizard to save the kingdom is still an enjoyable premise. Expository, yes, but it was from the 90s, fantasy writing has changed a lot in the past 30 years. But by the Light, were parts of this book contrived! Kahlan happens onto where Richard, the hero, ends up walking - fair. Richard just happened to have the special book memorized in his head, *and* be the Seeker - well, I guess I can roll with that, narrative causality and all.

But. Apples are poisonous in the Midlands because the wizards just *happened* to have a ""turn all food of a certain color poisonous forever and ever"" spell lying around somewhere (and what does that even mean, to *have* a spell? It was taken from them, somehow...), and no it can't be reversed and also it only works once, because reasons, and also it's range limited, and also who knows there the hell the spell came from - and then Darken Rahl (or Panis Rahl, not caring right now) got his hands on it through no adequately explained method and used it because ""children like red fruit"". 

And all of this set up just for like three moments where people got weirded out by Richard eating an apple, and as a contrived excuse for him to not have to have sex at one point.

**WHAT THE FUCK**.

Also, this is a bit of a non sequitur, but the Wheel of Time ripoffs are abundant. Now, I want to be careful about what I refer to as a ""ripoff"", because lots of fantasy has similarities. But this one really goes for it - there's a type of magic that women possess, and men who are born with it are considered extremely dangerous because of a time way long ago when a bunch of men got together, went crazy, and ushered in an age of Darkness. Sound familiar, WoT fans? What about the women from a foreign land who have special collars that allow them to control people in a large number of extremely specific ways, including making them feel pain, have an inability to move if they put the collar down, and being able to turn their magic against them? That's almost past ripoff and straight to fucking *stealing*. It even has, and I swear I'm not kidding, multiple times where a woman crosses her arms under her breasts. He's down to using *written tics* from the late Jordan.


Even then I was willing to call the book all right - until Darken Rahl and Demmin Nass showed up and had a conversation that went something like, and I swear this is only the slightest bit of exaggeration:

Rahl: You got the boy?

Nass: Yep, got the boy.

Rahl: You didn't molest him, did you?

Nass: Rahl, I *told* you I wasn't gonna molest this one! Just the ones you don't care about.

Rahl: Yeah, but what about that other time?

Nass: That was *ONE TIME*!

And then like three chapters later Rahl pours molten lead into a psychologically tortured pre-adolescent boy's mouth and then eats his balls. That, I should point out, is not an exaggeration at all.

I kept reading, though. And then. AND THEN. The *fucking* BDSM scene. Those of you who have read this book surely know what I'm talking about. Richard gets captured, out of nowhere, by a crazy BDSM lady with one of the aforementioned collars. I'd been warned that there was a 100-page BDSM scene in the book somewhere, but I didn't really take that warning at face value. Then this section started and it was, more or less exactly, that.

Not sure if it goes on for a hundred pages in truth, though. I made it to the part where a young girl (I got the impression she was about 9) starts BDSM torturing Richard and saying she'll have his love Kahlan raped, then he shatters her jaw and causes her to bite her own tongue off. I fucking stared at the page for a moment, processing what I'd just read. *A nine year old was fucked up enough to be talking about having a woman raped, and then Richard kicked her in the jaw hard enough that she bit her tongue off.* I then closed the book, walked to my computer, and typed this out - and I'm getting a sour taste in my mouth (literally, I can taste something sour) as I recall it.

Am I going to finish the book? I suppose so - I'm nearing the end, it'd be a shame to peace out now.

But oh dear lord. I had no idea. I... I didn't know.",Fantasy

1620571649.0,"Just because a fantasy story has 'dragons and wizards' in it doesn't mean all arguments for logic, realism, and consitency should be dismissed!","This is something I've seen too many times lately all over twitter, youtube, and even r/fantasy and I just want to get my thoughts out.

First of all, a fantasy story, like any story, starts with *established rules* that the audience and the author sign a pact on at the start of the journey. The rules should be clear at the start. The author can say. ""Alright, this is a fantasy story, so there will be dragons, wizards and magic and super strong giants that can swing a tree like a baseball bat. But our farmer boy main hero is a farmer boy and he is just like you and I, and he cannot swing an oak tree like a giant bat.""

As the story progresses, you can get into the shoes of the farmer boy protagonist and you know that he is just like you and I. So if the story is consistent, the farmer boy will stay that way and will solve his challenges using what you and I can realistically do if we were to thrust ourselves into this fantasy setting, this is what we mean by 'realism', and 'realism' here has nothing to do with dragons existing!

Now the story would become 'inconsistent' and 'illogical' if for example the author puts the farmer boy hero on a dragon's back, and starts to narrate thus: ""Our farmer boy hero and his mighty dragon flew from Fort Doom to Castle Evil from dawn till dusk to save his friends just in time."" WHILE before the story it was already established that Fort Doom and Castle Evil were 2,000 miles apart, and that dragons could only fly at the same speed as the fastest pigeon. Running some quick calculations, we arrive to the conclusion that this story here was **INCONSISTENT** and **ILLOGICAL**, because our farmer boy hero and his dragon only has 12 hours to cover 2,000 miles, and thus their average speed would be **167 miles per hour** on average! That is the speed of a Lamboghini in full speed, on a dragon's saddle! No average person, and in this case it was established that our farmer boy is just an average person, could survive that journey, nevermind the fact that a pigeon could only cover 500-800 miles a day on average.

(Game of Thrones season 8 is woefully guilty of these inconsistencies)

And this is what I am getting at: if you were to bring these kind of arguments into any fantasy discussion nowadays, someone somewhere would have pointed out his ultimate weapon ""This is a story with dragons and you worry about these things?!"" as if that were his trump card. Yet this 'trump card' is simply wrong! Just because a fantasy story has dragons in it doesn't mean good story telling and logical narratives should be thrown out the windows! It can be a fantasy story and it can be consistent start to finish.

This also applies to other things often mentioned here and has become controversial to mention around certain circles (think the Witcher adaptation) and so on, but that's a can of worms I probably won't open.",Fantasy

1682006932.0,"I am Brent Weeks, writer of BFF (Big Fat Fantasy novels) including the Night Angel trilogy and The Lightbringer Series, now returning after 14 years to my first love with NIGHT ANGEL NEMESIS. AMA!","Hi r/Fantasy, thanks for [inviting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/di8ox8/i_have_finally_finished_my_fivevolume_epic/) [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/7bvs61/i_am_brent_weeks_ama_2017_version/) [back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/595vzx/i_am_epic_fantasy_author_brent_weeks_i_talk_to/). I’m Brent Weeks, the author of [The Night Angel trilogy and the Lightbringer Series](https://www.brentweeks.com/). I’m a husband to the best wife in the world and a father to two amazing daughters (ages 10 and 7), and as my Covid-era distraction now a fountain pen aficionado. I am formerly—and fervently hope that makes me forever—a winner of r/Fantasy’s Stabby Award for Best Novel. I’ve won some other plaudits too, but none of those came with cool flair, so they’re not really worth mentioning, are they?

Today, I hope to talk to you a bit about my new novel set in the Night Angel world that is coming out next week called NIGHT ANGEL NEMESIS, to talk about unveiling secret ambitions, and to dodge as few questions as possible—I’m the one who signed up for a thing called Ask Me Anything, so I do expect the usual amount of silliness and irreverence.

If you’ve never heard of Night Angel or me, you CAN read NEMESIS first. Here’s the blurb to help you see if it might be your kind of thing:

“After the war that cost him so much, Kylar Stern is broken and alone. He's determined not to kill again, but an impending amnesty will pardon the one murderer he can't let walk free. He promises himself this is the last time. One last hit to tie up the loose ends of his old, lost life.

But Kylar's best—and maybe only—friend, the High King Logan Gyre, needs him. To protect a fragile peace, Logan’s new kingdom, and the king’s twin sons, he needs Kylar to secure a powerful magical artifact that was unearthed during the war.

With rumors that a ka'kari may be found, adversaries both old and new are on the hunt. And if Kylar has learned anything, it’s that ancient magics are better left in the hands of those he can trust.

If he does the job right, he won’t need to kill at all. This isn’t an assassination—it’s a heist.

But some jobs are too hard for an easy conscience, and some enemies are so powerful the only answer lies in the shadows.”

I intend to hit your questions in shifts so that those in later time zones have a chance of me answering their questions, too: I’ll spend at least an hour here in three different blocks throughout the day, and then come back in a few days to catch as many stragglers as possible. I’ll hit the most-upvoted questions first, which I hope will save some of you time asking duplicate questions—or seeing me repeat myself with the same response. But I’ll also look for questions that seem interesting or insightful or fun for other Redditors to see me tackle.

Next week, I’ll be hitting the road for a book tour, starting at my home bookstore: the [Powells in Beaverton](https://www.powells.com/book/night-angel-nemesis-the-kylar-chronicles-1-9780316554909/2-3), then doing a new virtual signing stop with [The Signed Page](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_UQEPQNIuRzezISs6N-BmlA#/registration) as I sign many books to send worldwide, then hitting [University Books in Seattle](https://www.ubookstore.com/events?id=229&month=04&year=2023) before flying down to San Diego to visit the new-to-me location of Mysterious Galaxy. From there, I’ll head to [The Tattered Cover](https://www.tatteredcover.com/event/brent-weeks-live-aspen-grove), this time to its Littleton, Colorado branch; and my last official stop will be at [Joseph-Beth in Cincinnati, Ohio](https://www.josephbeth.com/event/brent-weeks-discussing-and-signing-night-angel-nemesis).

For those of you who love listening to your books, I’m proud to have audiobook legend Simon Vance narrating NIGHT ANGEL NEMESIS. Not only is Simon in the Audible Hall of Fame, and quite likely the narrator with more books narrated than anyone else in the business (over one thousand titles now), this year he broke his own record by being nominated for the 49th and 50th times for Audie Awards. I’ve always loved working with Simon, and he agreed to stream a conversation with me about what he has fun with and how his process works on [May 3rd at 11am Pacific](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/audio-nightangel). My editor will probably try to force me to talk, too, but Simon would be entrancing reading a database of Social Security Numbers, so I intend to mostly ask questions and listen. We also recently conned Simon into re-recording ALL of the old Night Angel books, so the character voices and all the artistic choices a narrator makes when performing will match between old books and new. We’ll be taking live questions, too. (Register for that conversation [HERE](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/audio-nightangel).)

On May 16 (at 5pm Pacific), once everyone's had some time to finish this massive tome, Orbit's trying an experiment with me doing a Spoiler Book Club for everyone who wants to talk about NEMESIS, including the ending. If that sounds like something you'd be interested in--and I think there are some chapters you'll really want to discuss--you can register [HERE](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/spoilerbc-nemesis). I'll be there. My ergonomic keyboard is getting warmed up. I’ll be back in a half an hour to start the first round!

~~(EDIT 2: It's 2:26pm PT. I'm back from my break for the next hour or two. Probably two. Know that somewhere, I'm tapping away furiously at my keyboard, trying to answer as many of these questions as I can. And feeling deeply appreciative for how kind all of you are being--even those who don't like certain decisions I've made in my work have been really gracious even while being honest. I appreciate that,~~ r/fantasy\~\~. Good job keeping this community healthy and kind.)\~\~

~~EDIT 3: It's now 6pm PT and I've been answering questions for more than 5 hours today. My brain is tired. I'm going to take a break for a couple hours to see my family, but I'll be back for just one more hour later tonight. I wanted to let you know that I WILL read all the comments, even though it's clear now that I won't have time to answer them all. I will also be back in a few days to hunt for the late upvotes or over-looked gems. Thanks all for being so welcoming. I first joined this community when there were 60k members. That you've kept awesome with 3.2 million is amazing. Be back late tonight!~~

~~EDIT 4: I came back and hit as many as I could. I have to call it for tonight. I WILL come back one last time in the next couple of days to hit as many as I can. I see that there's no way I'm going to be able to answer every question, but I CAN promise that I will at the very least~~ *~~read~~* ~~every last comment.~~

Thank you, moderators, for the opportunity to borrow your stage to say hi again, and for all the work you obviously are doing to keep this place great. And thank you, r/Fantasy for your questions, your thoughtful criticisms (really!), your kind compliments, your stories--and especially your lactose-free ice cream recommendations. I hope that many of you will grab NIGHT ANGEL NEMESIS when it comes out on Tuesday. I'd love to hear what you think of it, and I hope that you find I've grown as a writer once again, and maybe shored up some of the weaknesses you pointed out. I can't promise that you'll like it, but I promise to give my best to become a better writer with every book, and beyond that, a better human.

FINAL EDIT: I came back one last time after my book tour and hit as many as I could. If I didn't get to your question this time, well... maybe I've been good enough that the moderators will invite me again in a couple years. :) I do also do live streams and you can find me in various spots on social media. I DO also read all of my email (though replies are sparser than I wish!) that's Brent at Brent Weeks dot com. Thank you again. See you next time!

I’ve been trying to both calm down enough to write this post (you’ll see why in the next paragraph), and then not to have one of these kinds of threads for a few days so that way no one would think it was a direct rebuttal to the most recent post about an author. It seems like I'll never get the timing right, so this isn't in rebuttal to the Dresden post from a couple days ago. It's just...all of them blended together.   


The day after sending out my monthly newsletter to let my readers know my father died, I received this email:

>How writing and finishing the Tranquility Series and stop wasting time writing about your personal life and problems. I mean really we all have life problems and have to deal with crisis in our lives, but hearing about their personal problems from someone who makes a great deal of money, I'm so tired of it. How about finishing what you started, because I like to move on and finish the Tranquility series.

It wasn’t the first one I've gotten - and it's not the last one I've gotten - but that was the one that made me cry. 

We get asked a lot of times why an author doesn’t have a new book out. It can be benign: does Book Title have a release date yet? Is the preorder date on Amazon accurate? (Answer: Unless you hear it from the author, it’s not accurate).

Sometimes, we get aggressive judgement right out of the gate: why the fuck is Book Title taking so long? Why does the author need \[things\] to write? Why can’t they get off their ass and just finish the book. 

There are other times that the aggressive judgement take a while to come, like after getting their “reasons why” question answered.

>I only started this series because you said it’ll be done in early 2019. Still waiting.

All of my books are delayed about two years right now. I’d like to pretend that’s not true, but they are. I have chronic pain, which makes it difficult to concentrate. Jumping around series, and trying new projects helps when I’m unable to think through a mid-series book. 2018 was a setback year for me. I was burned out from medical appointments, physio, always being in pain, not being able to think and focus…and I only wrote one book in 2018. And, it wasn’t the book most of my readers wanted. But it was the book I needed to write to get off my shoulders, so I wrote it. My mental health is important and it was a relief finishing that book.

Then, my Dad died in December. I had to fly across the country, then I had to fly back home for medical tests that had been booked prior to Dad’s death, and then I had to fly back across the country to help move my Mom into a senior’s complex because she is disabled and she was too afraid to be alone. 

Throughout everything, I kept my mailing list up to date. Everyone who follows me online in some form knows I have had health problems. While I have kept some of the details personal, I have not been secretive about why my books keep being delayed.

And that first quote was the first reply from anyone on my ""fan"" list that I got after Dad died. Telling me to get back to work. Because my grief was not as important as someone else's entertainment.

“Yeah, but Author is a jerk to their readers.”

How much abuse should an author take before they are allowed to tell people to piss off? How much toxicity should an author have to endure from their own projects before they decide to go do something else? At what point is an author allowed to go find another project (or job) because their current clients keep sending them hate?

It is dehumanizing to be treated like nothing more than an entertainment box for someone else’s amusement. It is demoralizing to have people who call themselves your “biggest fan” to tell you they don’t give a shit you’re sick; get the fuck back to work. It’s exhausting to never be able to write fast enough. 

I have one book I don’t remember writing. But I chose to write that book while mostly bedridden because that was healthier for me than the abuse I was going to get for being late with the book. 

I was days out of surgery, fighting an infection, and was being asked on social media if the surgery meant my books would be delayed.   
I’ve posted photos of me at physiotherapy where people have told me to get back to writing. 

  
I emailed people to say my father died; and someone told me to get back to work.  


It’s not funny. It’s abuse. It's toxic. It's rude. It's mean.

1682348528.0,Posting AI Content in /r/Fantasy,"Hello, r/Fantasy. Recently we and other subs have been experiencing a sharp rise in AI-generated content. While we’re aware that this technology is new and fun to play with, it can often produce low-quality content that borders on spam. The moderator team has recently had multiple run ins with users attempting to pass off AI-generated lists as their own substantive answers to discussion posts. In a particularly bad example, one user asked for recs for novels featuring a focus on “Aristocratic politics” and another user produced a garbage list of recommendations that included books like Ender’s Game, Atlas Shrugged, and The Wizard of Oz. As anyone familiar with these books can tell you, these are in no way close to what the original user was looking for. 

We are aware that sometimes AI can be genuinely helpful and useful. Recently one user asked for help finding a book they’d read in the past that they couldn’t remember the title. Another user plugged their question into ChatGPT and got the correct answer from the AI while also disclosing in their comment that was what they were doing. It was a good and legitimate use of AI that was open about what was being done and actually did help the original user out.

However, even with these occasional good uses of AI, we think that it’s better for the overall health of the sub that AI content be limited rather strictly. We want this to be a sub for fans of speculative fiction to talk to each other about their shared interests. AI, even when used well, can disrupt that exchange and lead to more artificial intrusion into this social space. Many other Reddit subs have been experiencing this as well and we have looked to their announcements banning AI content in writing this announcement. 

The other big danger is that AI is currently great at generating incredibly confident sounding answers that are often not actually correct. This enables the astonishingly fast spread of misinformation and can deeply mislead people seeking recommendations about the nature of the book the AI recommends. While misinformation may not be as immediately bad for book recommendations as it is for [subs focused on current events like r/OutOfTheLoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/12sc951/slight_housekeeping_new_rule_no_ai_generated/), we nevertheless share their concerns about AI being used to generate answers that users often can’t discern as accurate or not.

So, as of this post, AI generated art and AI generated text posts will not be permitted. If a user is caught attempting to pass off AI content as their own content, they will be banned. If a user in good faith uses AI and discloses that that is what they were doing, the content will be removed and they will be informed of the sub’s new stance but no further action will be taken except in the case of repeat infractions.

ETA: Some users seem to be confused by this final point and how we will determine between good faith and bad faith usages of AI. [This comment from one of our mods helps explain the various levels of AI content we've been dealing with and some of the markers that help us distinguish between spam behavior and good faith behavior](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/12xjf12/comment/jhjpex1/). The short version is that users who are transparent about what they've been doing will always be given more benefit of the doubt than users who hide the fact they're using AI, especially if they then deny using AI content after our detection tools confirm AI content is present.",Fantasy
1612204854.0,/r/Fantasy’s favorites and the Bechdel test: by the numbers,"The Bechdel test gets tossed around a lot as a metric for sexism in books/movies/tv/etc. Much of the conversation is dominated by arguing over whether or not the Bechdel test is even valid. The answer to that, I feel, is “it depends what you’re trying to figure out with it.” This post is an attempt to see how some of /r/Fantasy’s favorites fare when the Bechdel test is applied in a systematic fashion, rather than the cherry-picked way it usually is discussed.

#What is the Bechdel test?

It was first articulated by cartoonist Alison Bechdel in 1985 - [here’s the comic that originated it.](http://bechdeltestfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BechdelRule-768x432.jpg) For something to pass the Bechdel test, it must meet three criteria:

1. Feature two or more women

2. That talk to each other

3. About something other than a man

That’s it. It’s obviously not a high bar. And any feminist will tell you it’s not a great test for whether a work is actually feminist or not. Powerfully feminist works can fail it, and mysoginistic works can easily pass it. The *Twilight* movie, hardly the apex of the feminist movement, passes - there’s a scene in the beginning where Bella and her mom are talking, so it clears the bar. On the other hand, a movie like *Gravity* (starring an awesome female character) fails.

It’s not a coincidence that the Bechdel test originated with a comic. It is a joke, but a serious joke - it points to a real imbalance in how frequently and in what ways women are portrayed in media. It’s something that anti-feminists take more seriously than feminists to, or, to be a little more precise, anti-feminists *claim* that feminists take the Bechdel test much more seriously than feminists actually do. 

There are other tests one can apply, such as the Sexy Lamp test (“can this female character be replaced with the sexy lamp from *A Christmas Story* without substantially changing things?”), the Sexy Lamp with a Post-It Note Stuck On test (same as the Sexy Lamp test, to account for the circumstance where the female character provides the hero with information he needs to know, frequently occurs in James Bond movies), and the Mako Mori test (“does this feature a female character who has her own development arc, not in support of a man’s?”). But the Bechdel test is the first of these “tests” and the most widely known, so that’s what I’m going to be talking about here.

#What books am I looking at?

As I said, I wanted to be systematic about this, so I’m not choosing the books I’ll be looking at: I’m letting all of you people do it for me. Specifically, I’m looking at the top 10 books from the [2019 /r/Fantasy best novels poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/c7d7z8/the_rfantasy_2019_top_novels_poll_results/). Why 2019 specifically? Because it was the most recent list when I started this project. Because of the methodology of the polling, which goes by series/universe instead of individual novels, I’m just going to be looking at the first book in each series. (I feel a little bad that Sir Terry is going to be judged based on *The Colour of Magic*, but them’s the rules.) The specific books are:

*The Way of Kings* from the Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson

*The Hobbit* from the Middle-earth universe by JRR Tolkien (I debated whether to use *The Hobbit* or *The Fellowship of the Ring* as “book 1,” but it doesn’t actually change anything at all)

*A Game of Thrones* from the Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin

*The Eye of the World* from the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan

*The Final Empire* from Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson

*The Name of the Wind* from the Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss

*The Blade Itself* from the First Law by Joe Abercrombie

*Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* from Harry Potter by JK Rowling

*The Lies of Locke Lamora* from the Gentleman Bastards by Scott Lynch

*The Color of Magic* from Discworld by Sir Terry Pratchett

Observant readers may note that eight of the nine authors (nine not ten because Sanderson appears twice) are men, and the lone woman published with her initials because her publisher didn’t want to put out the book with the identifiably female name “Joan” on the cover. But that’s a different post.

#What’s my methodology?

I’m going to look at all these books, and see if they pass a strict reading of the Bechdel test. I will note how far into the book one has to go before the test is passed, and the circumstances by which it passes. Nothing in this post is a spoiler.

For something to qualify as a “conversation”, it needs to be between two individuals, and both need to participate. Professor McGonagall addressing the first years before the Sorting does not count, despite the presence of Hermione et al. There is a scene very early in *A Game of Thrones* where Magister Ilyrio’s serving girl tells Dany “Now you look all a princess!” which does not count because Dany does not respond. I recognize this is a judgement call on my part, but I want there to be clear lines and these seem fair. If anyone disagrees with my verdict, please let me know. And I’d be surprised if I didn’t miss something, especially in the books I don’t know as well.

And here’s where I try to turn this into something actually useful. We can’t really discuss any conclusions without something for comparison. To that end, as a control group, I will also be applying a **Reverse Bechdel test** to each of the books. To pass, the book must feature a conversation between two or more male characters that isn’t about a woman. I am applying the exact same definitions on what is or is not a “conversation.” Seems more than fair.

#Get on with it

* **The Way of Kings**. Passes the Bechdel test at the 9% mark, with the first conversation between Shallan and Jasnah. Passes the gender-reversed Bechdel test at 1%, with Kalak talking with Jezrien.

* **The Hobbit**. Fails the Bechdel test. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with Gandalf and Bilbo. (*Fellowship* also fails the Bechdel test, as does LotR as a whole, and passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1% with the Gaffer holding court at the Green Dragon.)

* **A Game of Thrones**. Passes the Bechdel test at 9%, with Arya and Septa Mordane. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with Gared and Ser Waymar Royce of the Night’s Watch.

* **The Eye of the World**. Passes the Bechdel test at 19%, with Egwene and Moiraine. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with Lews Therin and Ishamael.

* **The Final Empire.** Passes the Bechdel test at 72%, when Vin trades gossip with Lady Kliss at a ball. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with Lord Tresting and an Obligator.

* **The Name of the Wind**. Passes the Bechdel test at 70%, with the encounter between Auri and Mola. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with the crowd at the Waystone Inn.

* **The Blade Itself**. Passes the Bechdel test at 69% when Ferro encounters the Eater sister. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 2%, when Glokta interrogates Salem Rews.

* **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone**. Passes the Bechdel test at 57%, when Hermione lies to McGonagall that she decided to tackle the cave troll. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, when Uncle Vernon encounters random celebrating wizards.

* **The Lies of Locke Lamora**. Passes the Bechdel test at 51%, thanks to a few words exchanged between the mother-and-daughter alchemists d’Aubart. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with the Thiefmaker and Father Chains.

* **The Color of Magic**. Fails the Bechdel test. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1% with the Weasel and Bravd.

#Summary

8 of the 10 books on /r/Fantasy’s 2019 top novels list passed the Bechdel test. They passed the test, on average, 45% of the way through, though with a standard deviation of a whopping 28%.

10 out of the 10 books passed the gender-reversed Bechdel test, all within the first few pages of each book.

#Commentary

For every single one of these books, the reverse Bechdel test was passed in the first few pages of the book. Determining whether or not they passed a gender reverse Bechdel test was, in every case, a formality. Finding out whether or not they passed the regular Bechdel test was much more of a challenge. And one could argue that several of these that technically pass the Bechdel test fail it in spirit: *The Final Empire,* *The Name of the Wind*, and *The Blade Itself* certainly, and probably *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* as well. (*The Lies of Locke Lamora* isn’t on this list thanks to a substantial conversation between Doñas Vorchenza and Salvara, but that one comes after the one listed above.)

So what do I conclude from this? Pretty much what I expected to, honestly. The Bechdel test itself is nigh-worthless in assessing whether or not a given book is feminst. On the basis of any book in particular, passing or failing tells us nothing.

But in aggregate, it tells us a great deal. If there were equal representation of the genders, you would expect something even with these tests applied. It’s not even close.

Brandon Sanderson has commented on this with regard to Mistborn. [The original comment is here if you want to read it](https://old.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/3yyqf5/woa_does_this_series_fail_the_bechdel_test/cyhtotr/), but the point I want to mention here is Brandon’s admission that he was so focused on making Vin a “dynamic female lead” that he didn’t act as carefully or thoughtfully with the rest of the characters, so the entire crew is male by default. And that’s the key point right there - the “default” person, whether you’re a man or a woman, is male. There are whole fields of academic study devoted to the idea of “male-as-norm,” and you can find peer-reviewed study after study from psychologists, sociologists, and many others that bear it out. If you’re going to assert that this isn’t a thing, please do your research first.

I expect this post will ruffle feathers, but please keep in mind the values of /r/Fantasy and please be kind to each other.",Fantasy

END EDIT

Well, anything within reason, that is.I'm R.A. Salvatore...Bob, and I've been writing fantasy novels for more than 35 years. I'm best known for my Legend of Drizzt novels (except on Kashyyyk, but that's another story), which have been running from the beginning of my career and are still going strong with the release this week of  ""Lolth's Warrior,"" the 39th book (along with the 5 Cleric Quintet books, the Stone of Tymora Trilogy, an anthology of collected stories, and the ""Dao of Drizzt"" - I've done a lot of work in the Forgotten Realms).

I've got a bunch of other books, including 14 (with 3 more coming) in my DemonWars world of Corona.

I've worked on video games and tabletop RPGs, as well...it's been a busy 35+ years.Ask me anything...within reason.

EDIT: Well this is kind of funny. I couldn't figure out how or why I'm posting as Maleficent... Apparently, I checked into Reddit a few months ago and was assigned a name. So for today, I'm a  witch, and if you mess with me, I'll turn you into a newt - and it won't get better.

1636261385.0,Arcane on Netflix (First 3 Episodes) Absolutely Floored Me. Has Anyone Else Watched Yet?,"I was expecting a run of the mill videogame to TV-series but I have to say judging from the first 3 episodes I am blown away. Everything from the design, the music, and the acting went above and beyond anything I expected from this show. Has anyone else watched it yet? If so, what are your thoughts?",Fantasy
1702961612.0,Picked up Fourth Wing and I feel like I've been punk'd.,"I only heard about *Fourth Wing* a few weeks ago, and upon learning about it I *also* learned that it is explosively popular and very highly reviewed. A fantasy phenomenon that I'm missing out on! The premise looked interesting enough to warrant a purchase. I'm not really into academic settings in fantasy but I loved R.F. Kuang's *Babel* so I was willing to take a chance on something that is, as every source tells me, an excellent book.

It is not an excellent book. I think it may actually be very bad? 

*Fourth Wing* is billed as adult fiction, but it feels like this was a YA novel that the writer retroactively slapped a bunch of sex and F-bombs into to make it seem more mature. The first few chapters are loaded with cliches and tropes you would expect to see from, again, a YA novel like *Eragon*. Our MC has a classic case of Anime Main Character Hair, she'd rather be reading than fighting (but she seems to be mysteriously proficient at the latter anyway), and we're told a lot of stuff up front about her past that we're kinda just supposed to accept at face value. Our hero is very smart! And now she's going to prove it by rattling off a bunch of exposition disguised as worldbuilding!

I have put the novel down and I don't expect I'll come back to it. I guess I should have done a little more digging, but I'm plagued by the feeling of having been scammed. Every source I looked at told me this book is supposed to be a breakout hit for fantasy, but it's easily the worst book I've cracked open this year.

What's going on here? Am I just missing the appeal? Do I hate fun?",Fantasy

1621860494.0,Have you ever felt like NOT starting the final book in a series you love because it will be over after this?,"This is exactly what I'm feeling with Malazan Book 10. I've been reading it from March, 2020, and it has helped me a lot going through the quarantine and stuff. It has become my favourite fantasy series during the journey. Yesterday I finished Book 9, 'Dust of Dreams' and thought, Man I can't wait to get into Book 10, 'The Crippled God', the last book of the series. It was seating on my bookshelf and I picked it up. But I just can't start it. I read two paragraphs of the book and I out it back down because it feels like this is it, the end of the epic. I'll not get to know more of these characters I so love and enjoy. The intrigue will end, the mysteries solved, the questions answered (though knowing Erikson, I'll still have a lot of unanswered questions lol), the journey will be over.
Have you guys ever felt the same about a series?",Fantasy
1683116233.0,A Wizard of Earthsea is such a beautiful book,"I finally got around to reading this classic. Honestly was expecting to find it dated and cheesy given its age and the fact that I’ve seen people say it’s YA…but what I actually found is one of the most incredible fantasy stories I’ve read in a while. Maybe ever. 

In fact, the book feels the opposite of dated - it’s written in such a way that it actually feels kind of timeless. There’s a mythical, fairy tale quality to the narrative that makes it seem like it could’ve written yesterday or a 100 years ago. Le Guin’s prose is a thing of beauty - so simple but so elegant at the same time. She can convey do much in one simple line. 

The book really filled me with a sense of melancholy, longing and nostalgia. Ged’s story of finding and fighting his own shadow feels both epic and intimate and could be interpreted in so many ways. I understood it to be a tale of a man accepting his own vulnerabilities and insecurities but I’m sure others will have their own understanding of it. 

I really can’t recommend this book enough - it truly deserves its place in the fantasy canon",Fantasy
1532380501.0,Tolkien's response to Nazis,"In 1938 JRR Tolkien was in talks with a German publisher about a German-language version of The Hobbit. Except he was asked to provide proof of his Aryan ancestry. This was his reply:


**Thank you for your letter. I regret that I am not clear as to what you intend by arisch. I am not of Aryan extraction: that is Indo-Iranian; as far as I am aware none of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects. But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject - which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.**

**Your enquiry is doubtless made in order to comply with the laws of your own country, but that this should be held to apply to the subjects of another state would be improper, even if it had (as it has not) any bearing whatsoever on the merits of my work or its sustainability for publication, of which you appear to have satisfied yourselves without reference to my Abstammung.**",Fantasy

When I asked this question yesterday, I was expecting like maybe 3-4 recommendations, but you guys came in CLUTCH and recommended almost 30 series. Quick math's tell me that's probably over 100 books (3\*30=90 at minimum).

To help myself organize them (because I plan to get through most of them eventually), I created a section with some information for each series. You can see an example below.

[My man taking a mad long time with that last book.](https://preview.redd.it/vc5up9onnf051.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=9674dfb20733c82b378ea28e1e5d1671d1b4c7d5)

I realized halfway into writing this that this might be useful to other people. So, I wrote up the entire word document, and am uploading it here for others. Feel free to use it as you like. Well, don't like hand it in as an assignment or something, but other than that you can use it. Maybe in the future I might do this again for Female Fantasy MCs and other genres, if not for anyone else then at least for myself.

Here it is. Enjoy.

Also thanks for all the series recommendations. My final pick will be either The Gentleman Bastards, The Six of Crows, The Shadow & Bones or The Ririya Revelations.

Edit: So Apparently I have quite a few mistakes in this. Unfortunate. I will be making changes to the OG Doc and reuploading it in a few hours with the fixed mistakes. My Bad. Will edit post with another edit when I do finish making changes.

Edit #2: For those asking why I don't add the authors, it's mainly cause as I said earlier this list was originally for me lol, and I don't care about the author unless I really like the series. Case in point, I don't know a single author on this list. By the time I was thinking of sharing it, I was already like 60% through and I did not feel like retroactively researching the authors again lol. I assume if you like a series enough, you'll get to know the author on your own. At least, that's how it is for me.

Edit #3: For those recommending me series now, A little too late lol. Yesterday I was free, but today I got a ton of school work to work on lol, so it's incredibly unlikely for me to add it atm. I might make a second guide at a later date though.

EDIT #4 (The Important one): I added 3 new series (Cause I took out a few since apparently they are all related and reading the synopsis of the last ones would ruin the other ones). I also made a few fixes and stuff to it. Series added were ones I forgot to add last time. No new mentions were added.",Fantasy

It is legitimately cool to be here on Reddit on publication day in the US and U.K. for *All The Seas of the World*. (Canada has its ebooks and audiobooks ready, too, actual books will be 3-7 days in arriving in bookstores. There was an April snowstorm where the printer is! Don’t ask.) But we haven’t timed an AMA this well before. Given the constraints of the last two years, it feels good to be celebrating a book launch here online with you. I’m going to hope for a return of travel and in-person events soon — and I’ll announce them when they are slotted — but for now, let’s all pour a cocktail, a whisky, a cup of tea (not in same glass, please, people) and settle in to chat.

To re-introduce myself, I’m Guy Gavriel Kay, and today sees the release of my 15th novel, because although I may not be fast, I’ve been publishing since *The Fionavar Tapestry* in the 1980s. i.e. a long time. I’m one of the lucky writers: books in over 30 languages, staying in print, and generous responses from readers around the world over all this time.

*All The Seas* has already had several starred reviews and really rewarding pre-publication attention, so I can only hope you’ll all enjoy it, too. As usual, let’s try to avoid spoiler questions (unless behind the clever Reddit blackout that hides them until clicked on) but otherwise, I’ll be back here at 8 PM EDT to type replies like a crazy person for a couple of hours.

You can start posting your questions right now, though, and check back for answers tonight, or tomorrow, or any time, because these AMAs stay up. Let’s see how we do.

OK, I'm here now, and I see there are questions. Many, many, many (very good) questions! Thank you, you terrible people. I'll answer as many I can. One note ... if it looks as if I've missed or skipped yours, check if I answered it in someone else's. There's a few, there always are, which address the same point. (Best place to start with my work, for example.) Also, please be indulgent about typos! I can't (won't) blame autocorrect, but I'll be going fast here.

&#x200B;

OK, I think that's a wrap for tonight. Questions were great, many were very funny, some were genuinely engaging 'long conversation' ones. I did my best to get to as many as I could. I appreciate all who showed up (and who will show up later, as time zones slide). Hope you had fun. Slainte.",Fantasy

1609705045.0,You can be a true fantasy fan without reading Tolkien,"I've had a couple of people tell me in the last year that to be a true fantasy fan you must have read Tolkien. However, I strongly disagree with this view, seeing it as genre gatekeeping. I'm curious what others think.

It seems that many new readers these days discover the written fantasy genre after first enjoying fantasy films and TV shows, isekai anime, graphic novels, or YA books and then start exploring fantasy novels. As such, the first fantasy novels they're likely to read are more often the Witcher series, GRRM, and similar instead of Tolkien.

I know my kids love the fantasy genre and discovered it through YA books and anime. But when they tried to read Tolkien they found his stories didn't appeal to them. I hope one day they'll go back and give Tolkien another try. But if they don't that's also okay. B/c hey, they still love the fantasy genre!

And please note I'm not disputing Tolkien's influence on the fantasy genre. Just pointing out he's not the entry point for every new fantasy reader these days.

Previous poll results from [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/p1mwnx/the_rfantasy_2021_top_novels_poll_results/) and the [Top Lists Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/lists/)

Special thanks to the other mods for helping out majorly, especially u/kjmichaels who did so much. Thanks also to u/CoffeeArchives, u/Valkhyrie, and u/happy_book_bee. We wouldn't have this done without all that you did.

1613399094.0,"Oh Robin Hobb, what have you done?","I avoided your colossal series for so long, because so many things put me off: the medieval setting, animal companions, weird names based on virtues, the overly cliché fantasy titles, the cover art. Then one day I was in the mood for a comfort read, something familiar and easily digestible. My eyes fell on a copy of Assassin's Apprentice. I thought it might be a nice, light, palate cleanser.   


Yeah, I was an idiot.

A week later, I finished Assassin's Quest, and that bittersweet emptiness that only comes after finishing a life-changing book hit me with full force. Coming out of a state of complete and utter immersion like that left me feeling apathetic and paralyzed. Goddamn, Ms Hobb, you are good. I had almost forgotten what character development felt like, and now I can never go back. Also, Regal can just go eat a bag of toenail clippings.

I was aching to read about the rest of Fitz's adventures, but reined myself in and moved on to the Liveship Traders. I'm so glad I did. Again, I had been put off previously by the idea - sentient boats? That sounds like some weird Thomas the Tank Engine fan fiction or something. And again, Ms Hobb, you exposed me for the picky, snobbish idiot that I was. How do you take these ridiculous-sounding concepts and turn them into such rich, beautiful stories? I'm in awe. Also, Kennit can just go eat a bag of toenail clippings dipped in serpent slime. 

Then I finally got to return to Fitz. And after being away from him for three whole books, coming back felt all the sweeter. I could feel the time that had passed since the first trilogy, and it made the experience so much better. Fool's Errand destroyed me. I don't remember the last time I actually shed tears over a book, but you've gone and made me cry Ms Hobb. I hope you're happy with yourself.    


Now I'm halfway through Golden Fool, and I can't function properly in daily life anymore. I barely get any work done, because even when I stop reading my mind is still trapped in those pages. Every free moment is spent getting an extra chapter in. I'm postponing stuff just to get more time to read. My life is being controlled by a book. I haven't felt like this about a series since I was an unjaded kid, and it hurts so good.

I realize there are more then enough posts gushing over RotE, but I just needed to get these thoughts out of my system. I'm obsessed. These books are like a bowl of warm stew on a cold winter day. They somehow manage to be extremely cozy and wholesome whilst simultaneously ripping your heart out and feeding it to the dogs. You've ruined me Ms Hobb, and I can't thank you enough for it!

TL;DR: If you haven't read Hobb's work, do it. If you have, do it again.

EDIT: Wow, apparently some people thought my emotional outpouring was worth awards! That has never happened before. Thanks kind strangers!",Fantasy

I'm kind of old now (32M), but my Ma used to read **The Hobbit** to me when I was too young to read for myself. As a child, I read a lot of fantasy from **Redwall** to **The Lord of The Rings**. When the first **Harry Potter** came out, I was still in elementary and my Ma got me hooked again! I love her and I love a good fantasy story. What I love about **The Hobbit** in particular is how the heroes are just insignificant dudes who enjoy a good smoke, good food and drinks at their home but they step out of the comforts of their home and are swept away by adventure! It will always be my favorite! **Tales of Earthsea** by **Ursula K Le Guin** is great! This is all just a prelude to how disappointed I am by a lot of the modern epic fantasy. I like dark fantasy! Me and my lil bro totally vibed on Diablo 2 when I was a kid and I really dig **The Old Kingdom/Abhorsen** series by **Garth Nix**! However, rape is something I am not into. Particularly when it gets as bad as interspecies rape, gang rape, etc., which sadly has become almost normalized in fantasy.

Recently, I got to **book 9** of **The Malazan Book of the Fallen** series. Personally I feel that there some poor writing in general with this series but a few characters are written so well (**Tehol/Bugg, Kruppe**) that I kept reading. There is rape in several of the books. Given the amount of war in this series and experiencing my second major armed conflict of my life (U.S. occupying the Middle East and Russia invading Ukraine), I have come to accept rape as part of war and can bear it to some degree in the books I read by dismissing it as realism. However, there comes a point where it goes too far and fantasy regularly crosses this line. The optimist in me wants to say that the intention of the author is to describe a really graphic and repulsive rape scenario to evoke a reaction of disgust and horror. But sometimes I feel like it is used so often as a plot device that it helps normalize it. It goes so far sometimes, in the Malazan series for example, >!a woman has the front of her feet removed so that she is ""hobbled"" always presenting her backside to men and dogs in her tribe.!< **In anime/manga**, not a great example since women are frequently abused in anime/manga, >!women are raped to death by goblins or whatever!< **in Goblin Slayer and Berserk** (I would love Berserk for detailed drawings and darkness and world bulding, RIP Kentaro Muira). I also tried recently to read **The Demon Cycle** but that has >!gang rape!< too (also poorly written, there's a lot of words devoted to fighting which kind of reads like DBZ fan fiction). Can we get an appreciation/recommendation thread for all the authors that wrote engaging fantasy where women are awesome with stuff they had to overcome that wasn't being >!gang raped by a bunch of goblins?!< Personally I really like **Monstress by Marjorie Liu/Sana Takeda** comic series and **Children of Blood and Bone/Legacy of Orisha by Tomi Adeyemi**. I am sure there is so much out there! Let's hear it!! Thanks for reading!!!

Edit: I am extremely sorry if I triggered traumatic experiences for any of you. One of the things I am sort of curious about as a man who has never experienced sexual abuse is how people who have experienced this navigate through this genre where it has almost become normalized. I am very sorry if I have caused any stress for anyone my only intention was to show how extreme authors go! Also another interesting point that I considered after posting and that other commenters have replied is why does the public often react to other very personal forms of torture/abuse like slavery or forced starvation, etc. differently. I would argue that they aren't often described in as much detail or given the attention in fantasy literature but I don't like those either! I hate movies like ""Saw"" and others that have so much torture!",Fantasy

Sometimes you can just ignore it and sometimes it breaks immersion completely. 

In fantasy, the thing I notice the most is how archery is done. Characters having a conversation with their bow at full draw like it's some kind of gun, or being able to use a warbow perfectly the first time they touch it like it wouldn't require skill or strength. It's a pet peeve and it obviously depend on how heavily it impacts the plot, but at times you just wish the author would've looked it up when writing the story.

1645465814.0,Lin-Manuel Miranda no longer involved with adaptation of Patrick Rothfuss's KINGKILLER CHRONICLE series,"Actor, writer and singer-songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda [has confirmed](https://variety.com/2022/film/awards/lin-manuel-miranda-defends-not-submitting-bruno-for-oscars-teases-new-little-mermaid-songs-1235182753/) he is no longer attached to the long-gestating attempt to bring Patrick Rothfuss's **Kingkiller Chronicle** to the screen. 

Interest in the property began back in 2007, when *The Name of the Wind* was published to a rapturous reception and very high sales. It intensified in 2011, when the sequel *The Wise Man's Fear* was published.

In 2015, Rothfuss reached a wide-ranging and high-value deal with production company Lionsgate that included a feature film trilogy based directly on the novels, as well as a TV show which would act as a prequel and focus on Kvothe's parents. The following year it was confirmed that Miranda, the nuclear-hot creator of hit stage musical **Hamilton**, was working on the project as a songwriter for both the films and the TV series, whilst Lindsey Beer was working on the script for the first movie, based on *The Name of the Wind*.

In 2017, things really got moving when Showtime optioned the TV series rights, attaching John Rogers (**Leverage**, **The Librarians**) to write, produce and showrun. In 2018 Sam Raimi entered talks to direct the first film. A few months later, in 2019, John Rogers confirmed he had written all ten scripts for Season 1 of the show, which was entering pre-production. Things looked like they were going very well.

Then things collapsed, pretty quickly. In September 2019 Showtime abruptly halted all work on the **Kingkiller** TV series and returned the rights to Lionsgate. By that time it was clear that Raimi had passed on the movie project, and subsequently opted to direct *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* instead. The rumour in Hollywood was that Showtime has massively over-committed to its ambitious **Halo** TV series, spending much more than originally planned, and had to quickly divest itself of several other expensive shows, even ones that had been greenlit, in order not to have a huge budget overrun. Ironically, **Halo** was moved from Showtime to Paramount+ and the financial issues sorted out behind the scenes, meaning that possibly the **Kingkiller** project could have moved forwards after all. However, the project seemed to go cold.

In November 2020, Lin-Manuel Miranda confirmed he was still working on the IP, but the plan to adapt the (gigantic) novels as single movies had now been abandoned and the project was being reconceptualised as a TV show based directly on the novels. Miranda cited his work on the HBO/BBC co-production **His Dark Materials** (based on Philip Pullman's novels) as giving him a ""fresh perspective"" on the complexities of adapting a fantasy trilogy for the screen.

Miranda's departure from the project seems to be down to two reasons. First, his own workload is through the roof. He is currently enjoying huge success from his work on the Disney animated movie *Encanto*, including his first-ever Number One single for ""We Don't Talk About Bruno."" His 2021 film *Tick, Tick...Boom!* has also enjoyed significant critical and commercial success. Secondly, it sounds like he had not found a way of adapting the books' structure satisfyingly, noting that it has an ""insane Russian nesting doll structure,"" a reference to its multiple timelines.

An unspoken fly in the ointment is that the third novel in the trilogy, *The Doors of Stone*, remains incomplete after eleven years. Rothfuss's editor confirmed in 2020 that she had not yet read a single word of the book and did not believe any work had been done on it since 2016. Rothfuss has since spoken more openly about progress on the book, and read its prologue for the first time last year. However, no release date has been set.

Given the immense success of the series - reportedly well over 10 million and possibly closer to 20 million copies of the two books have been sold to date, easily making them the most successful debut epic fantasy series this century - it is likely an adaptation will eventually happen. However, it will not be in the near future and it will not be with Lin-Manuel Miranda's involvement.",Fantasy

I find it incredibly helpful. I don't always go straight through to book 2 when I finish book 1. Plus his stated reason is amusing. I don't notice many authors adding in exposition -- usually I'm just a little lost because maybe I forgot who is who and what they were doing.

1683317519.0,I am so tired of stories where characters don't communicate for no reason other than to create more drama in the plot,"I've seen it a thousand times, in some books/shows multiple times in one storyline. Simply telling someone something would solve EVERYTHING in 10 seconds, but NOOOOOOooooOOOOO, lets keep it inside for no apparent reason just to drag the story on so we can have a big tearful joyous ending.

Along those same lines, characters that show they can do things (like fighting back) but suddenly forget how simply because doing so would make things to easy for their side.

Basically, I HATE IT when characters do stuff/don't do stuff simply because the writer doesn't want to wrap things up yet. This is the worst trope in all of writing and it instantly kills drama/suspense for me. Just makes me want to skip to the end where they finally spill the beans or do whatever it is they need to do to end the plot line.",Fantasy

1594800818.0,The Dragon Prince (2018) is really good fantasy.,"The Dragon Prince is an animated kid’s show on Netflix that I’ve really been enjoying lately. Each episode is a tight 20-25 minutes, but they feel a lot longer with how well paced the action is. 

The plot of the show is about a war between humans and elves/magical creatures. Humans slay the Dragon King and destroy the egg of his only heir, the Dragon Prince. As retribution for this atrocity, elven assassins bind themselves to kill the human king and his heir, Prince Ezran.  One of the elves discovers that the egg of the Dragon Prince wasn’t actually destroyed and refuses to kill Ezran. Along with Ezran and his stepbrother (edit: half brother, not step brother!) Callum, the elf sets out on a journey to return the egg to its mother and end the war. 

My favorite character of the series has to be General Amaya: she’s the human princes’ aunt and a total badass in armor. I also loved Rayla, the elf who befriends the princes. I’m a sucker for characters who are conflicted about what’s right and wrong but do what they think is good anyways.

Even though this is a kid’s show, the conflict is still very nuanced and interesting. The “bad guys” are good friends of the prince and this adds another layer of intrigue to the plot. The magic system is also super cool; half the fun is just watching the animations. The art is truly gorgeous. There’s a part in the first episode that shows the Dragon King breathing lightning/thunder and it was absolutely incredible.

Watching this made me kinda sad that we won’t ever get a Wheel of Time animated series. Channeling would have been really awesome to watch in a similar art style to this show. (I’m still super excited for the live action though!) Fantasy in general lends itself well to animation.  I can totally imagine Kingkiller or the Liveship Traders as an animated series.",Fantasy

The plotting is incredibly tight and masterfully done in this dark sci-fi show, the characters are all fully realized and impeccably cast, and the music and atmosphere are just sublime.

Going into as few spoilers as possible, the series kicks off when a series of missing children cases in the small German town of Winden in 2019 starts to unravel a huge web of intrigue, lies, deceit, and secrets. There's a ton of characters but all of them matter and connect in ways you wouldn't even expect while remaining consistent until the end, all without having twist upon twist thrown at you just for the sake of twists. >!And it's legitimately the best plotted story about time travel that I've ever had the pleasure to experience, with every character across the many times cast so well that you would have sworn they were played by the exact same actors at different points in their lives.!<

The series is fully complete at 3 seasons and 26 hour long episodes, and the finale completely sticks the landing without ever buckling under the weight of its densely crafted plot. So please, if you can, give Dark a shot on Netflix. I guarantee that you will not regret it.",Fantasy

I told her Percy Jackson's Lightning Thief, and she looked at me like I'd just killed her prized cow and said ""Really? Percy Jackson? THAT'S your favorite book? I expected more from you."" Confused I asked her ""What do you mean you expected more?"" and she said ""I know you've read things like The Art of War, so I expected more from than JUST Percy Jackson as your favorite book."" I've been seeing that mentality more and more in reading groups and book clubs recently. People are outright getting attacked for being adults that enjoy young adult fiction. And I just....don't get it. Isn't the point of reading to be for enjoyment? Who cares what people read, what they enjoy or why?

&#x200B;

Do I study things like metaphysics in my free time? Yeah, yeah I do. I've read Art of War, The Prince, and many, many other tomes that people would consider too ""dense"" to be light reading or enjoyable reading. But that isn't ALL I like to read. I don't always want to have to sit and ponder the deeper meanings of words or interpret subtext. I don't want to have to be paying FULL attention at all times, otherwise I'll miss key details. Do I love Malazan? I absolutely do. Is it a headache to get through at times because of the dense, extremely detailed writing style that absolutely does not hold your hand or make it easy for you to get certain information? It certainly does.

I don't always want to feel like I'm having to fight an uphill battle to get the most out of the books I'm reading. I enjoy having adventures that are light, fun and fluffy.   And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I guess it just makes me sad because I remember growing up and being viciously bullied for being a nerd and reading things like Wheel of Time and Eragon because being a nerd wasn't ""cool"" yet unless you were into Harry Potter.

1678698738.0,"How did orcs go from Tolkien's short, bowlegged creeps with the best technology around, to tall, dim-witted hulks of muscle?","The OG orcs represented, among other things, the worst aspects of industry, and industrialized warfare in particular. So whatever their other flaws, they certainly weren't stupid or ill-equipped. But they *were* explicitly shorter than Elves and Men.

But nowadays, I feel that whenever the ""orc"" name is slapped onto a fantasy race, they are inevitably very physically strong, but often dumb and usually living in primitive, shamanistic tribes with crude weapons.

(Heck, I recently played the D&D game Solasta: Crown of the Magister, and in a cutscene where an orc stands up straight next to an elf, the elf comes up to the orc's *elbow*.)

Overall, they feel more like a stereotyped take on ""scary savages"" that threaten civilization. Which is a bit odd, since the days of civilization being under threat from barbarian tribes are long, long gone. Meanwhile, we are all familiar with the more negative aspects of industry in the modern world, ranging from pollution to immensely destructive warfare.

How did this fundamental change in what the word ""orc"" conjures up come about? It reminds me a bit of how people tend to think of Dracula as a suave charmer, and not the crude, ugly bastard from the original book.",Fantasy

1609783326.0,Homophobic Book Reviews (minor rant)," So, I just picked up the Mage Errant series because it seemed like fun, and I just finished the first book, and it was pretty fun - as well as being painfully realistic in its depiction of what it feels like to be on the recieving end of bullying, and of a character with what seems to be social anxiety disorder (that time where Hugh locks himself up in his room for days cos he's worried his friend is mad at him? Been there, done that.) Like, it's a book that genuinely gave me the warm fuzzies in a big way lol. 

 So cos I enjoyed it, I went to check out some of the reviews for the later books to see if they were as good. And lo and behold - 90% of people were complaining about a character being 'unnecessarily' gay in a later book (which I haven't read yet, so no spoilers!) 

 I just don't understand though, why people think there needs to be a 'reason' for a character to be gay. That's like me saying 'I don't understand why there's so many straight people in this book.' 

 Some people are gay. Why would it ruin a book for you, to the point of some people tanking reviews with like, 1 star because 'too much gay stuff, men aren't manly enough, grr'. It just seems pathetic. Grow up and realise that not everyone is like how you want them to be, and don't give someone a bad review because you're homophobic. 

 Okay rant over. Was just very annoyed to see this when I was looking for actually helpful reviews about what people thought of the rest of the series.

 Edit: I really appreciate all the thoughtful discussion this post has attracted, thank you!

 Also, if you find yourself typing the phrase 'I'm not homophobic BUT-' maybe take a few seconds to think really hard about what you're about to say.

1645636823.0,Burning books: Sarcastic recommendations of popular fantasy books,"Sarcastic, not serious, but grain of truth fantasy recommendations of popular fantasy books. 


The Broken Earth: recommended if you haven't been hit by a full barrage of fantasy jargon in a while and you miss that sensation. You prefer your fantasy worlds on the brink of destruction at all times.

Stormlight Archive: recommended if you think fantasy should be like science, world-building should be deep and editing your books for prose is more like a guideline than an actual rule. 

Throne of Glass: recommended if you like Cinderella, and also if you have absolutely no idea what assasins actually do. 

The Name of the Wind: recommended if you like teenage boy wishfullfillment tropes but you need something more high brow, like good prose, to tell people when they ask you why you like this book. 

The Lord of the Rings: recommended if you want an epic adventure fantasy where you don't ever have to wonder what the landscape the characters trudge through looks like because every 10 pages or so Tolkien will stop and spend at least 5 pages telling you exactly what it looked like. And then maybe a character will sing a song about it.

The Curse of Chalion: if you are tired of reading about young, eager adventurers, and would rather read about older, traumatized adventurers instead. 

Game of Thrones: recommended if you want to read fantasy that is ""real."" And by real you mean conforms to your vague and largely inaccurate ideas of what the Medieval period was like and your bleak worldview overall. 

The Sword of Shannara: recommended if you prefer your Tolkien imitators to be blatant about it. Like extremely blatant. 

Wheel of Time: if you started this in highschool and don't mind a lot of meandering. Can seem overly long at times, but what do you cut? Surely not important phrases like women crossing their arms over their breasts for the 100th time. 

Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel: recommended if you want to read ""high brow"" fantasy but really like Harry Potter and wish magic existed. Serious bonus points if you finished the whole book with no skimming whatsoever, all 10% of you. 

Piranesi: recommended if oh thank goodness it's shorter than her last book.

Cradle: you don't have any candy in your house right now and you are looking for the book equivalent. You really enjoy video games where you level up. You like feeling, a few books into a series, that the mc is progressing too quickly and easily while simultaneously feeling like it's taking a thousand years. 

The First Law: recommended if you have a bleak outlook on life and want to read characters that share this right now. Or if morally grey/black characters = edgy and cool in your mind with bonus points for blood, the more the better. 

Malazan: recommended if you want the grittiness of grimdark, but be forced to feel deep compassion for the characters and victims of characters and the trauma they go through. In other words read if you want to feel traumatized.

A Court of Thornes and Roses: recommended if you actually just want to read smut, but with magic people. 

Spinning Silver: if you want to read a book with female characters who have agency, take charge of their lives, actually talk to each other...but are still in problematic romantic relationships. 

The Lies of Locke Lamore: recommended if you were wondering what ""witty grimdark"" would be like in a book, and really like long descriptions of things, and planning, not a lot of doing, but lots of planning to eventually do things...big things...at some point...after a few more descriptions...about what barrels look like.

The Farseer Trilogy: if you prefer your characters to be consistent, like they still make the same mistakes book after book after book. Essential reading if you think character growth is way overrated.

Books of the Raksura: if you want to read a serious book with violence and court politics as themes and characters that are bird creatures with names that sound like they could be the names of my little ponies: Flower, Chime, Pearl, Blossom etc. 

Edit: added one more

The Silmarillion: recommended if
a.) You are a fan of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings but especially recommended if you enjoy fast-paced, highly readable thrillers like Beowolf, the Epic of Gilgamesh or the ancient texts of most major religions. 
b.) You are feeling really left out of all those fights on r/ LOTR right now. You too would like to argue with people who have usernames like u /youshallnotpasschemistry on the deep lore. Round out your reading with Unfinished Tales and Nature of Middle Earth to really get em good. ",Fantasy

1575405853.0,The Dragon Prince is worth watching,"Especially if you were into Avatar back in the day.

If you haven't given it a shot, you need to. If you gave season one a shot and then said, ""meh.""... I'd suggest getting a season one recap and watching season two and three.

I'll admit, after season one, I was pretty ""meh."" I told myself I'd stick with it because I actually enjoyed having a short little show that didn't take much attention or emotion to get through. It was something to have on that's different from the other things I like to watch. The animation was pretty lame and frustrating, but I got through it.

Season two was when I really noticed the story potential. I was like, ""oh okay, we've got something here."" They fixed up the animation to where it was no longer noticable as an issue. The story began to tug at my heart strings whether I wanted it to or not. I became invested after season two, to where I immediately googled when season 3 would come out.

Season 3 is now on Netflix, and it was honestly the best animated season I've seen of anything since Avatar (I don't watch a ton of anime, so it's the best I've seen). The animation was noticable, but for how amazing it was. The colors, the action, the movements, the framing, the settings, etc.... awesome. The story was fantastic. It jumped around to different characters (kind of like game of thrones) but never felt jarring or out of sync. Plus, we finally saw some story arcs through, some plots with endings, and a few new ones start up. I'm pumped for season four.

A little research has shown me the creators have planned for seven seasons since the beginning. Which is nice to know that they're not just winging it. They have a plan and they're seeing it through. It continues to get better every season.

I'm writing this in hopes of turning more people to giving it a try. It doesn't get a ton of mentions and talked about like other Netflix shows. I don't want Netflix to decide to cut it like it did its superhero shows, before enough people find it and give it the ol college try. I want this show to do well.

1659483661.0,Historically Accurate and Miserable for the Sake of Misery: Common Arguments About and Critiques of Sexual Assault in Speculative Fiction,"*Obligatory grains of salt: this topic is a difficult and emotionally charged one. People are going to disagree with me and with each other, and that’s perfectly fine. I just ask that we all remember the person on the other end of the argument and do our best to be respectful.*

If you spend any amount of time lurking in online spaces that discuss fantasy media, you’re bound to eventually come across a heated discussion about depictions of sexual assault in fantasy. People will have wildly diverging opinions about trigger warnings; Thomas Covenant will be simultaneously described as a work of genius and the most horrible thing ever written; someone will say authors should NEVER write about \[X, Y, Z\] and someone else will reference *1984* in response to that. I’m something of a lurker myself, so I’ve seen these arguments play out many times over. I’ve thought about this topic a totally normal amount that shouldn’t be concerning at all, so today I thought I would explore some of the main points that inevitably tend to get raised during these conversations and what I think about them.

**PART 1: COMMON ARGUMENTS**

**Argument 1: SA is gross and upsetting and I don’t want to read about it in my spare time.**

**My thoughts:** okay, totally understandable. We all read for different reasons. We all have different lines in the sand for what’s too upsetting to be tolerated in what we read. We all have different lived experiences and relationships with those lived experiences. There is nothing wrong with avoiding a certain kind of content.

My only caveat is that I have sometimes seen this argument extend past *I don’t personally like it* to encompass *therefore it’s wrong to write/read about or for others to like it.* I had a conversation with the author Caitlin Sweet about this topic and I think she said it perfectly: *“personal aversion shouldn't constitute a sweeping proscription.”* For every person who reads for escapism and adventure and pure enjoyment, there’s another who reads to explore dark issues, whether for catharsis or to gain an understanding of something they haven’t experienced personally or because they see beauty and meaning in art about suffering. All of these relationships with art are possible, valid and no more right than another. There is space for all of them.

**Argument 2: books about SA are misery porn.**

**My thoughts:** they *can* be, but it’s all about execution and interpretation. I have absolutely read fiction about SA that feels exploitative and gratuitous to me. But that is not to say a) that all works featuring assault are inherently like that or b) ***that all readers feel the same way about any given work as I do.*** I think this argument assumes bad faith on the part of both readers and writers; it implies that readers would only want to read about assault because they find it titillating (see Part 2 for more thoughts about this) while writers would only want to write about it to titillate.

I’ve [spoken previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/i58tyc/thinking_about_different_kinds_of_darkness/) about the way that some books about SA are important to me because of how resonant, thought-provoking and cathartic I find works to be when they have something meaningful to say about a complex topic that I feel so passionately about - a topic that I believe *needs* to be explored because it is a massive societal issue rife with stigma, shame, apathy and misunderstanding. Again, not everyone is going to feel that way, and different people will feel different ways about the same works- that’s fine. But it only seems fair to acknowledge the existence of a diversity of relationships with this kind of fiction, purposes for writing/reading it, and subjective opinions about particular works.

**Argument 3: non-survivors shouldn’t write about it.**

**My thoughts:** I absolutely value the insight, vulnerability and courage of authors who write stories about trauma while speaking openly about being survivors themselves. I think it’s very admirable. But I also think that empathy and research exist, and some of the most powerful books I’ve read about SA are written by authors whose life experiences I know nothing about - furthermore, I do not think that their life experiences are any of my fucking business. I also think the decision to self-disclose should be totally voluntary, and in the present climate, that is definitely not always the case. Everything that I want to say about this is articulated in Krista D. Ball’s [essay](https://new.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/uk2boe/the_commodification_of_authenticity_writing_and/) *The Commodification of Authenticity: Writing and Reading Trauma in Speculative Fiction* and the resulting thread, so if you want to see this explored in-depth, I suggest you check that out.

In short, though, here is what I think: those who think they’re taking a bold stand for trauma survivors by demanding that strangers disclose their painful personal experiences to a public that is ready to rip them to shreds for one perceived misstep in their fictional representations (sometimes to the point of harassing them into disclosure) have an extremely dubious understanding of trauma advocacy and are doing something pretty harmful with no actual beneficial results. As I said in one of my responses to Krista’s essay, what do you mean, one of the prevailing tenets of rape culture (if you are unfamiliar with the term or want to read an excellent article exploring the scope of the issue, [here you go](https://www.vox.com/2014/12/15/7371737/rape-culture-definition)) is not believing survivors while simultaneously demanding that they repeatedly share the details of what happened to them with complete strangers? When \*I\* do it, it's actually very smart and brave and progressive of me and definitely not for Twitter clout!

**Argument 4: but it’s historically accurate!**

**My thoughts:** YES I am talking about Game of Thrones for this one because it is the poster child of this argument. A number of people associated with the show and books, including George R.R. Martin, have explained that the world’s brutality towards women is meant to reflect on “the way it was” in the medieval time period the books are based on. A few thoughts about this one:

* I kept adding and deleting bits about the debates around whether Game of Thrones is Actually Historically Accurate and some of the potential repercussions of emphasizing that widespread sexual violence is a feature of the past dichotomized from the present, but I think they bogged things down a bit - if anyone is interested in exploring that more, let me know.
* My main point is that this argument can feel a little silly to me as a justification ***on its own*** because fantasy is inherently transformative, isn’t it? Authors deliberately choose to take inspiration from some aspects of the real world (past and present) and forego others. The process of creating fantasy fiction is inherently one of stitching together the real and the imaginary. The notion that authors are somehow obligated to replicate all aspects of a source of inspiration indiscriminately just does not ring true when there are dragons and face-changing assassins etc. etc. I’ll quote medieval historian David Perry (full interview [here](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/15/missing-the-target/)):
* *“These are all things that tell us a lot more about ourselves than about the Middle Ages…we pick and choose, the creators pick and choose, they want to show something that will be disturbing or controversial or will be a political tool and they try to say history supports us in this. And then they throw in dragons and zombies and then they say that’s unrealistic but that’s okay, that’s just storytelling.That comes back to what I try to say–it’s okay to draw from history, but history does not wholeheartedly support any one of these fictional depictions. These come from creators making choices. And the choices they make have consequences.”*
* A great example of that “picking and choosing” he mentions is that stories justifying their inclusion of SA because they’re set in wartime and SA is a tool of war rarely, if ever, feature male survivors of SA even though SA as a tool of war absolutely has targeted and continues to target people of all genders. It’s worth exploring why this authorial choice gets made so often. I also think [Daniel Abraham](https://aidanmoher.com/blog/2012/04/articles/concerning-historical-authenticity-in-fantasy-or-truth-forgives-you-nothing-by-daniel-abraham/) wrote very articulately on the overall issue of historical accuracy and authorial choice.
* That being said, I do believe it is possible to write about sexual violence as a way of exploring our own world’s past and how its legacy continues on today. My thought process for writing about marital rape in a fantasy world inspired by the Victorian era, the time of legal coverture, was to explore the mindset of someone experiencing and working through assault that isn’t necessarily identified as such by the world around her; in my work as a sexual assault advocate, many of my clients who are abused by their partners do not feel that their abuse “counts” the way that stranger-perpetrated assault does due to how we have dealt with and defined SA for a very long time. But I think that in order to make the claim that the incorporation of brutality against women is some kind of purposeful statement about history or the present day, you actually have to have a statement or purpose for your inclusion…and in many of the instances where I see the argument about historical accuracy rearing its head, I don’t necessarily know if that’s happening (again, this is with the caveat that different people find different meaning in given works). Otherwise it can fall into the territory of feeling trivializing.

**Argument 5 (opposite of Argument 4): fantasy stories shouldn’t be burdened by the ways that the real world sucks.**

**My thoughts:** this argument is epitomized by Sara Gailey’s essay “[Do Better: Sexual Violence in SFF](https://www.tor.com/2016/08/22/do-better-sexual-violence-in-sff/).” Their argument is essentially that the ubiquitous inclusion of sexual violence against women in SFF is a problem because it implies that rape and rape culture are societal inevitabilities, that authors who write about sexual violence against women don’t know how to write about women *without* writing about sexual violence, and since the point of speculative fiction is to speculate, authors should aim to speculate about worlds free from sexual violence.

For the record, I do think it’s totally possible that some authors might not know what to do with their female characters and throw in half-assed assault plotlines as cheap character development, and I do think that’s worthy of criticism - in fact, I’ll talk about it later. I also think that one of the most powerful things about speculative fiction is that it can show us alternatives to our own world. As I mentioned while talking about Argument 1, sometimes you just want a reading experience where you don’t have to think about the fact that people like you are oppressed and often hurt in the real world. And sometimes speculative stories free from oppression can help open our minds and allow us to see how things could be different in reality.

But I think there are elements of overgeneralization and assumptions of bad faith at play here. While I said that I could see some authors only writing SA plots because they don’t know how to write fully-fledged female characters, I think it’s disingenuous to say that Robin McKinley was doing that with *Deerskin* or that Ursula Le Guin was doing that with *Tehanu* (oh God, Charlotte’s talking about *Tehanu* again) or that any author who has taken the time to write meaningfully about sexual assault has only done so because their imagination wasn’t strong enough to imagine a world without rape, something Gailey states about such authors in their essay.

Back to Argument 1: sometimes you want escapism, but sometimes you don’t. Sometimes you want to see common human struggles and painful experiences reflected and explored in your literature, and I don’t believe that there is any reason for speculative literature to be an exception to that just because it is speculative. Stories that reflect on trauma can be just as important as stories that forego its inclusion, and both sides of the coin are valid. As a final note, I asked Gailey about this essay in a recent r/fantasy AMA of theirs, and I really appreciate their response, which you can read [here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/lnmkqk/comment/go1t5g7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

To summarize my thoughts about Arguments 4 and 5, I don’t think that “it needs to be based on the real world’s past” or “it’s SFF so it shouldn’t resemble the real world” are valid arguments for including or excluding sexual violence from stories on their own. I think it all depends on the purpose of the story and what you do/don’t do with the sexual violence in your story.

**Argument 6: it’s problematic to write about topics that could be triggering for some readers.**

My thoughts about this can be summarized by something that YouTuber Sarah Z says in her video essay “[Fandom’s Biggest Controversy: The Story of Proshippers vs Antis](https://www.google.com/search?q=sarah+z+shipping+wars&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS980US980&oq=sarah+z+shipping+wars&aqs=chrome.0.69i59.7769j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8):”

*“There are a lot of people talking about it as an accessibility issue. The idea is that, by virtue of the game \[Boyfriend Dungeon\] including elements of stalking at all, even with a warning, not everyone would be able to play because some people might have trauma surrounding it, and it’s therefore unethical for the game, in its current state, to exist. The natural implication, then, is that anything short of restricting the kinds of stories that can be told is not only insufficient but actively hostile to people with trauma. To counter this, we might be tempted to point out that some creators tell and share these kinds of stories to cope with their own trauma, and art can be a vital tool for exploring trauma, and it’s equally restrictive to discourage them from telling their own stories, but honestly we don’t have to. An author’s personal experiences here are none of our business. It doesn’t matter, because, fundamentally, this way of viewing art that sees upsetting content as an accessibility issue is untenable. The breadth of things that might trigger or upset a person is essentially infinite. The human experience is diverse and a piece of media that everyone on earth will find appropriate to consume doesn’t exist.”*

For an essay about the first hypothetical rebuttal Sarah mentioned and its relationship to disabled and queer communities, check out Ada Hoffman’s “[Dark Art as an Access Need](https://adahoffmann.substack.com/p/dark-art-as-an-access-need).”

**Argument 7: but why do people get so upset about representations of SA when fantasy writers also write poorly about war/torture/murder and no one complains about that?**

**My thoughts:** every time there is a post on r/fantasy critiquing the writing of SA in spec fic, a post saying something along these lines seems to follow. I have a few thoughts about this:

* Critiques of non-intimate violence (war, murder, torture etc. as opposed to SA or abuse) in speculative media, especially their glorification and use for shock value without any realistic psychological impacts, absolutely do, and should, exist.
* The notion that both “types” of violence, intimate and non-intimate, can be criticized is not negated by the existence of critiques focused on just one or the other.
* You might see more discussion focused on intimate violence for a few reasons that I can think of:

1. The emotional relevance of the issue to the average fantasy reader’s life. Vastly more readers of English fantasy literature are going to be directly impacted by this kind of violence than they are going to be impacted by experiences of war, murder or torture.
2. The way that issues of intimate violence are so deeply impacted by broader societal attitudes and prejudices that are, in turn, upsetting to read when depicted uncritically in (and potentially impacted by, depending on what you believe) media. Rape culture is something that I see at its worst every day in my job - I cannot overstate how drastically it changes survivors’ experiences and outcomes in every conceivable way. I don’t think you can make the argument that there is an equivalent “torture culture” or “murder culture.”

**PART 2: COMMON CRITIQUES**

**Critique 1: lots of backdrop SA for the sake of making the world gritty and shocking**

**My thoughts:** the use of lots of backdrop SA is often closely tied to the argument that a world needs to be “historically accurate.” It can feel exploitative and trivializing when authors throw around lots of random references to brutalized women just to set the tone of the world/story, especially when that story doesn’t really think about those women’s experiences or the complexities of sexual violence as it relates to societal mores at all. Survivors’ experiences, needs and voices are already frequently dismissed and silenced in the real world, which is set against them in many ways. With that in mind, sometimes when you hear all these casual references to SA randomly mentioned - making it clear that assault is a big part of the world - but the topic is never really addressed, it can feel like it plays into that dismissal or is at least unpleasantly reminiscent of it. I use the word “exploitative” because, with the dismissal of survivors’ experiences and the distortions of rape culture still in mind, authors who use this approach treat painful, complex, stigmatized lived experiences as nothing more than aesthetic for a story. I don’t necessarily mean that every story that so much as mentions SA needs to have it at the absolute forefront of the story, but I do think that it is worthwhile to consider its purpose and framing before it is included as a background reference.

**Critique 2:** [**Fridging**](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge)**/ the assault of women to spur male character development**

**My thoughts:** “But there are lots of real-world examples of men being motivated to \[do X, Y, Z\] because of violence against women!”

Sure, but the underlying attitude behind that historical motivation and its frequent framing in fiction is that a woman’s SA/abuse/death/etc should be focused on *only to the extent that it impacts a man.* The focus here is the man’s honor and pain and consequent actions, not the actual female survivor’s experiences. As I have said, survivors’ suffering is often dismissed and minimized in the real world. We are more than objects to be fought over and our pain is more than a man’s inciting incident in his Hero’s Journey; when those attitudes are reiterated without thought in fiction, it can get tiresome.

**Critique 3: The sexualization/romanticization of SA perpetrators/scenes of assault**

**My thoughts:** Ok, this is where my hot takes get the hottest.

* **Hot take 1:** everything I said about Argument 2 applies here: different people will feel different ways about the same works, but those who wield this critique without discernment about all works featuring SA are just plain wrong in my opinion.
* **Hot take 2:** I always see the argument about SA existing in fiction for the sake of titillation mentioned in the context of male authors and readers. That ignores the existence of a long, long history of romance/erotica featuring “noncon” intended for a female audience. In the past we had bodice rippers - there is a fascinating history behind them and their relationship to historical notions of consent (or the lack thereof) and proscriptions against women’s sexual pleasure. To read more about that, a good starting place is [here.](https://bookriot.com/the-history-of-consent-in-romance/) Now there’s a booming market for Dark Romance™ and specific niches like Omegaverse. For the sake of fairness, I think that needs to be mentioned.
* **Hot take 3:** there is a wide variety of opinions regarding fiction impacting reality, and the arguments always seem to come to a head when it comes to this particular area of criticism. On one hand, there is the argument that the romanticization/sexualization of SA in fiction goes on to detrimentally impact the way that readers think about these issues in reality whether they realize it or not; on the other hand, there are those who argue that they are fully capable of differentiating one from the other and fiction is a safe place to explore fantasies that we would not actually want to be involved in in real life. My wishy-washy personal opinion is that both can absolutely be true depending on the individual person, the works involved and a variety of other factors - they are not necessarily 100% mutually exclusive statements. I will also say that I think there is a vast difference between the following:
   * A series like *A Court of Thorns and Roses* by Sarah J Maas, which is frequently categorized and marketed as young adult. In it, the male romantic lead is framed as an ideal feminist lover whose abuse is not identified as such in text and is justified by excuses, many of which are commonly used by real life abusers, that are fully endorsed as valid and romantic by the narrative.
   * A dark romance categorized for adults that is clearly labeled as a dark romance everywhere that it is sold.

**Critique 4: SA that is used by the narrative for cheap female character development, specifically to “teach her a lesson” or make her stronger**

**My thoughts:** this is to be clearly differentiated from stories that meaningfully depict the aftermath of trauma and/or healing. I’m talking about the instances of kickass Strong Woman butterflies emerging from traumatic chrysalises with no meaningful journey involved. Part of what is so devastating about sexual assault is that it is about choice and control over essential, fundamental things being taken away. This trope feels so cheap, trivializing and disrespectful because it glosses right over the impact of that disempowerment and veers into the territory of the [“lemonade from lemons”](https://www.michigandaily.com/michigan-in-color/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-lemonade/) platitudes that I guarantee most survivors have heard from at least one, if not more, very well-meaning person. To this section I will also add that there is a great deal of emphasis on survivors being “perfect” victims who respond in tidy ways that are not messy or challenging, while in reality trauma responses can be incredibly varied. I think that this trope could be born of this expectation, and that this expectation accounts for readers’ often-hostile reactions to fictional trauma survivors who cope in ways that defy that tidy, expected narrative.

**CONCLUDING THOUGHTS**

Readers are not a monolith. Authors are not a monolith. Survivors are not a monolith. I hope for a SFF community where we can understand that different readers read for different reasons, and that all of those reasons can coexist. Similarly, I hope we can understand that different readers are going to have different relationships with the same works. I hope we can take a step back from immediate assumptions of bad faith about those who choose to feature SA in their reading and writing, and at the same time, I hope that those who avoid it altogether do not get lambasted for that choice. Both choices have validity. I hope that we can analyze what we read and create with a mindfulness of the tropes and approaches that evoke, replicate or feed into the overwhelming stigma, misunderstanding and disrespect survivors face in the real world.

A few community-specific notes: readers looking for particular recommendations avoiding SA or dealing with it in particular ways (no on-page assault scene, no victim-blaming, no perpetrator POV) should not have to face backlash for their requests and then have to consequently justify them by divulging their personal trauma histories to random querulous Redditors. This is one of the main reasons that the [Sexual Violence in SFF](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQi6C2RQvjGzjSoXU0D063fCFcz1wCHXFUe7PfEsGrk/edit#gid=0) database exists. I think it’s an excellent resource, and I encourage everyone [to contribute if they can. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/a3dyez/sexual_violence_in_sff_database_20_update/)

Finally, I’ve made something of a project of reading SFF that explores trauma, and I thought I would conclude by describing a few of the works that I have appreciated the most featuring sexual assault. There are a few of these books that feature often-difficult topics in addition to SA or elements that might be difficult for some readers, so I included notes about those in spoilers.

* *Damsel* by Elana K Arnold - explores the gendered power dynamics of fairy tale tropes by mashing them together in a unique story about a girl who is rescued from a dragon by a prince.

1658573050.0,The first AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER animated movie will be a sequel focusing on Team Aang,"[It's been confirmed](https://ew.com/events/comic-con/first-avatar-the-last-airbender-animated-movie-will-focus-on-aang-comic-con-2022/) that the first new Nickelodeon **Avatar: The Last Airbender** project will focus on the original cast and will be set after the original show. The news was revealed at the San Diego Comic-Con. 

Original **Avatar** creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko have teamed up with Nickelodeon to create new animated projects in the same universe. Three animated movies have so far been greenlit, with at least the first set for a theatrical release. The first movie will be directed by Lauren Montgomery (**Voltron: Legendary Defender**, **The Legend of Korra**). DiMartino and Konietzko will write, with OG **Avatar** writer Eric Coleman also on board. Further projects, including a new ongoing animated series, are also under discussion.

It's assumed that the original voice cast will return. The precise storyline for the sequel is unknown, but DiMartino and Konietzko previously authorised a series of graphic novels dealing with subjects like the search for Zuko's mother and political tensions between the Earth Kingdom and the Fire Kingdom colonies cut out of its territory a hundred years earlier, eventually leading to the founding of Republic City. These graphic novels could provide a storyboard for new projects, or the writers may choose to tackle unrelated subjects.

These projects are unrelated to the live-action remake of the original animated series being worked on at Netflix. The first season of that project wrapped production last month and will debut on Netflix in 2023.",Fantasy

Thanks much for a good time, everybody. I just went through and answered a bunch of questions I didn't get to last night, and read more of the responses. But now I've got to get back to my regular life. 

That said, It's been a while since I've done one of these free-for-all Q&A's, and I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed them. I'm not on reddit much. But I think I'm going to do a few more Q&A sessions over on Facebook and Twitter, where I'm a little more active.

Heya everybody, I'm Patrick Rothfuss.

I'm a fantasy author.

I'm a father. I have a four-year-old and a one month old. Both boys.

In addition to being an internationally bestselling Fantasy author, I run a charity called Worldbuilders. (www.worldbuilders.org) Over the last five years we've raised over 2 million dollars for Heifer International.

Here are some guidelines based off the Machine Gun Q&A sessions I run [on my blog.](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/category/machine-gun-qa/)

  1.  You can ask any question.

  2.  Bite-sized questions are best. I'd rather answer a bunch of smaller, more entertaining questions rather than spend all my time laboriously typing up 3-4 long, detailed answers and having to ignore everyone else as a result.

  3.  One question per comment is best. It's just simpler and easier that way.

  4.  I reserve the right to lie, make jokes, or ignore your question.

       4b. If I ignore your question, it’s not because I hate you. It’s probably just because I don’t have anything witty to say on the subject.

  5.  I reserve the right to be honest, snarky, or flippant. Either consecutively or concurrently.

  6.  I won’t answer spoiler-ish questions about the books.

I will be back at 8 pm Central to answer questions.

I've just read the latest Brandon Sanderson (Rhythms of War) and finished up Brent Weeks' Lightbringer pentalogy and was recommended to read the Witcher books or the 'Wheel of Time'. I've been looking in bookstores and all the new ones have these irremovable 'stickers' on them saying 'Now available on Netflix' or 'Now streaming on Amazon Prime'. I made the mistake of buying a copy of 'Good Omens', thinking the sticker could be removed and was annoyed to find that it wasn't a sticker at all, but printed onto the actual cover art.

1663860916.0,Amazon confirms changes to its ebook return system,"Despite the latest TikTok trend, serial returning of fully-read Kindle ebooks has been a long issue. In theory, Amazon says they allow returns up to 14 days for any ebook, including fully read, but in reality they have allowed returns up to one year (Source: Literally me. My royalty statements over a decade of publishing). If a person had a lower sales series, it was really easy to see trends such as:

1. Buy Book 1. Return 1 day later.
2. Buy Book 2. Return 1 day later.
3. Buy Book 3. Return 2 days later.
4. Buy Book 4. Return 2 days later.
5. Buy Book 5. Return 1 day later.

This has always been a specifically Amazon problem, as they allowed these kinds of returns. With pressure from American author associations, Amazon has finally said they will make improvements to this system.

For me, the biggest improvement is this:

>Most notably, we will de-activate self-service returns for any book read past 10%, adding substantial friction to the process.

People will still take advantage of the system, because people are people. However, this will slow things down and add an easier-to-follow paper trail within the Amazon system.

We would each read the other's favorite series so that we could discuss and share about them. This means I'm reading A Court of Thorns and Roses and she's reading Mistborn. 

Since we've done this and have been discussing it with others, there have been tons of ""those books are for women"" type comments towards me. My wife's mother even said ""you're going to turn him into a girl"" to her (side note, the hilarity of that statement is still amusing both of us) and that she shouldn't be ""making me"" read a ""girl's book"". 

While I don't think I'm really the target audience for ACOTAR, I still think it's a good story with some cool elements and I've stayed up way too late reading them a few nights. I also like being able to enjoy something that my wife loves so much. I just find it so funny and a bit strange that people are so quick to judge that I'm reading them.

1705854191.0,How to recommend books when someone requests no sexual assault,"I've been on this sub for a while, and one thing I've noticed is that people tend to struggle giving recommendations when the OP clearly specifies that they don't want to read books with sexual assault or rape in them. I've decided to make a post about some things I think would help people when making recommendations. Starting with the obvious:

# Read all of and respect the any request that asks people to avoid recommending books with sexual assault

**Read the entire recommendation request.** Often times there's something else the original posts request is asking for and a disclaimer line at the bottom that specifies no sexual assault. People frequently don't see the disclaimer or only read the title. If you can read all 1,746,560 words in A Song of Ice and Fire or all 3,325,000 words in Malazan Book of the Fallen, you can read an entire reddit post. Please do so.

No matter how well a book fits the other parts of the request, **if it contains graphic on screen sexual assault,** **do not recommend it**. I don't care how much you like A Song of Ice and Fire, The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, The Sword of Truth, Malazan Book of the Fallen, or any other series that obviously contains graphic sexual assault. I don't care how well written you think they are. I don't care how well you think it's handled. They should not be recommended on these posts.

I know this seems obvious, but I've seen people recommend all of the series I've listed. Seriously, somewhere between 8-10 people were recommending Malazan on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/194mksc/what_is_a_staple_fantasy_you_think_everyone/) that specifies no sexual assault. On the same day, one of the top comments on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1946cay/what_is_the_most_evil_act_youve_ever_encountered/) about ""the most evil acts in fantasy fiction"" was being populated with examples of extremely graphic scenes of sexual assault and rape in Malazan. I know it's not the majority of people doing this (most of you will find the rest of this essay more nuanced and helpful, hopefully), but there's enough out there that I feel like it should be called out.

# How to tell if a book contains sexual assault

**If you aren't sure/don't remember if a book contains sexual assault or not, try to double check**. [The Sexual Violence in SFF Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQi6C2RQvjGzjSoXU0D063fCFcz1wCHXFUe7PfEsGrk/edit#gid=0) is a great resource. In addition, [StoryGraph](https://thestorygraph.com/) has user generated lists of content warnings. Look for tags for sexual assault, sexual violence, and rape after clicking on Content Warnings: See All on the page for a book. Neither of these resources is perfect, so if you are really unsure or know that you have a hard time remembering details like whether or not a book contains sexual assault, **it's probably best to not recommend anything**. You can also specify what aspects you are sure about (ie, ""I know there's no graphic scenes of rape in this one"") and what you are not sure about (""There might have been sexual assault as part of a character's backstory, I don't remember"").

Sometimes, there's a bit of confusion about what counts as sexual assault. [The definition of sexual assault from RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/articles/sexual-assault) is:

>sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the victim. Some forms of sexual assault include: Attempted rape, Fondling or unwanted sexual touching, Forcing a victim to perform sexual acts, such as oral sex or penetrating the perpetrator’s body, \[and\] Penetration of the victim’s body, also known as rape

Keep in mind that consent is about more than not saying no and coerced sex is still rape. Once again [RAINN's definition can help clarify](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent):

>Consent cannot be given by individuals who are underage, intoxicated or incapacitated by drugs or alcohol, or asleep or unconscious. If someone agrees to an activity under pressure of intimidation or threat, that isn’t considered consent because it was not given freely. Unequal power dynamics, such as engaging in sexual activity with an employee or student, also mean that consent cannot be freely given.

I often see people struggling to recognize sexual assault in fictional settings because it does not look like how we typically think of sexual assault in the real world. **It's still sexual assault.** To give an example, >!Orogenes being forced/coerced to have sex with one another for reproductive purposes!< in The Fifth Season is not consensual and should be considered rape. Other times, it's because the book itself does not clearly/explicitly recognize what happened as sexual assault or because our society still has blind spots for what we consider sexual assault to be. For example, a number of people have interpreted when >!Tylin rapes Mat!< in A Crown Of Swords (The Wheel of Time) as a humorous interlude and not rape. I've found this to be an issue especially in the case of male victims of sexual assault, and I want to point anyone who wants to learn more to Pop Culture Detective's videos about it in other forms of media ([part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc6QxD2_yQw), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nheskbsU5g)). If anyone wants to give more examples in the comments of scenes of sexual assault or rape that are not always recognized as such by readers, I would appreciate additional examples being given in the comments.

# But this book doesn't contain graphic on-screen sexual assault, so that must mean it's ok, right?

Often, we don't know where the OP's exact boundaries are for how explicit the sexual assault must be. Some people are ok with sexual assault as long as it's not on screen. Others don't want it mentioned at all. Obviously, read the original request carefully to see which one the OP seems to want. **It's best to error on the safe side.** If it's not specified, but if sexual assault

* is part of the world building
* is threatened
* is a theme in the book
* is relevant to a character's motivation in the book
* is part of a character's backstory
* has happened off screen/is implied to have happened
* might have occurred, with some level of ambiguity (including questionable consent)
* is used to provide imagery to express how terrible a fantastical/violent event in a book is (ie. used metaphorically)
* is joked about
* is relevant/threatened as a part of forced marriages
* is mentioned repeatedly
* etc

**either recommend a different book or add a disclaimer for context**. Obviously, part of this is also a judgement call. If rape is a major part of the worldbuilding for a book or is a major part of a character's backstory, it's probably best to recommend a different book. If it very briefly crosses a female character's mind that she might be in danger of being sexually assaulted but nothing happens with it, in my opinion, a disclaimer should be enough.

To give an example of what I mean that comes up constantly, Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson has no graphic on-screen scenes of sexual assault in it, but rape and sexual assault are a major part of the world building (ie. >!the rape and murder of Skaa women and girls!<), which is immediately obvious from just reading the first couple pages of the book and is brought up repeatedly throughout the series. Again, commenters should either add a disclaimer or (ideally, in my opinion) recommend a different book. For example, someone could recommend Tress of the Emerald Sea over Mistborn if you still wanted to recommend a Sanderson book.

On the other hand, consensual explicit sex scenes are fine unless otherwise specified, and no additional disclaimers are needed. I've seen a couple people give disclaimers for these, and I think it's important to remember it's not the presence of explicit scenes that people want to avoid, it's the nature of them. Just because a book contains sex and/or violence does not make it contain sexual violence. I think it's important to add disclaimers for scenes with dubious consent though, and scenes of particularly violent sex should probably be given a disclaimer even if it's consensual. Also, you should probably give disclaimers for things that don't meet the exact definition of sexual assault but are related to it (genital mutilation, sexual harassment, abusive relationships, stuff like that).

**Please respect that some people don't want to deal with the extremely sensitive real world issue of rape or sexual assault at any level in their escapist fantasy books.** If you are afraid of giving a disclaimer because of spoilers, well, that's what spoiler tags are for. Having information and context is always helpful. **Give people the choice on whether or not they want to risk being spoiled or risk being traumatized.**

Although having a disclaimer for additional context can be very helpful, please also respect that when all the top comments have disclaimers of ""it might not contain a graphic rape scene but..."" in them, it can be disheartening. **Please make an effort to upvote and/or recommend books that don't contain sexual assault at all.** In addition, if you see a book recommended that needs a disclaimer or straight up does contain sexual assault, **please comment with a correction**. If a correction gets added to your own recommendation, please take that graciously. I think we all understand that mistakes will happen on these posts and people forget about details around sexual assault in a book all the time, which isn't a moral failing. Just keep it in mind for next time.

Additional examples of books containing things on my bulleted list and how/when to provide disclaimers would be appreciated in the comments. In addition, if anyone disagrees about part of this essay or wants to discuss a part further, I would be happy to talk about it in the comments. I'm not the sole authority on how to give recommendations on these sorts of posts, this is just some advice I think people will find helpful based on what I've seen people do in the past.

# Other Comments

It's best to keep the conversation focused on giving recommendations. Comments about sexual assault being frequent or infrequent in fantasy are generally not very helpful, especially when they are not paired with any recommendations. Especially do not comment about if the OP's request to avoid sexual assault should be allowed or if it is an ok thing to ask. Please also don't get side tracked into discussions about whether sexual violence or regular physical violence is worse. The OP asked to avoid one and not the other, and it's not your place to question why.

Also, just to clarify, my own post is about giving correct recommendations to someone who does not want to read about sexual assault. It is not about how common sexual assault is or isn't in fantasy. It is also not about whether or not sexual assault should be included in fantasy books, etc. Personally, I'd prefer if the discussion in the comments stayed focused on how to give correct/accurate recommendations.

Finally, I want to give a shout out to all the good people who spend the time to make sure their recommendations are accurate and the ones that comb through the comments in posts requesting no sexual assault, adding disclaimers or saying that a book actually does contain sexual assault. You know who you are, and I think you're awesome.

1596982560.0,Why J.R.R. Tolkien Never Won a Hugo Award,"The Hugo Awards are the premier awards for science fiction and fantasy literature, first given out in 1953 and every year since 1955. One of the more interesting mysteries of the award is that J.R.R. Tolkien, widely regarded as the most prominent fantasy author of the 20th Century, was never given one despite being eligible on multiple occasions.

*The Lord of the Rings*, Tolkien's best-known work, was originally published in three volumes despite being written as a single novel: *The Fellowship of the Ring* and *The Two Towers* were published in 1954 and *The Return of the King* in 1955. This made the individual books eligible for the 1955 and 1956 Hugo Awards, and the novel as a whole also eligible in 1956. Similarly, *The Silmarillion*, published in 1977, should have been eligible in the 1978 Hugo Awards. Later Tolkien works, consisting of off-cuts from his notes and repackaged material previously published, would have been more controversial but likely could have made eligibility in other categories (particularly *Unfinished Tales*, effectively a short story collection, published in 1980).

*The Lord of the Rings*' failure to qualify is perhaps unfathomable to modern readers given its titanic impact on genre history, but more understandable when given context. When the book was originally published, it attracted strong reviews from the likes of W.H. Auden and C.S. Lewis, but opprobrium from a lot of mainstream critics. Although *The Hobbit* (1937) had already become a well-regarded classic of children's literature, its sequel initially was deemed too long, too weird and too unclear in its audience. There was also a modest delay between the UK and US publication, and the book was only available for more than a decade in hardcover, putting it out of the price and reach of many readers.

*The Lord of the Rings* also had two other things going for it: although the Hugos did not ban or omit fantasy, it was generally seen as a science fiction award first and foremost; an outright fantasy novel did not win the award for the first time until 2001, when *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* took the top prize. Once that happened the floodgates opened and more followed (*American Gods*, *Paladin of Souls*, *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell*, *The Graveyard Book* and all three volumes of **The Broken Earth** trilogy), but for much of its history, the award has not regarded fantasy in a good light. Secondly, Tolkien was British, and the Hugos were seen as a predominantly American award. To win a Hugo Award, British authors had to have their work published by prominent US genre publishers or become so dominant in the field that they couldn't really be ignored (as with Arthur C. Clarke). This cross-Atlantic ignorance also went both ways, with the Hugos having almost zero profile in the UK. The first Brian Aldiss knew that he'd won the 1962 Hugo Award for Best Short Story (for his *Hothouse* collection of interlinked stories) was when the award showed up at his house in the post. The first issue probably penalised Tolkien, although the latter did not, as his books were distributed by a reasonably big US publisher within a year of their UK release.

Although certainly not obscure on release, it was not immediately regarded as a classic and the American WorldCon attendees (the two ceremonies were held in Cleveland, Ohio and New York City, respectively) seem to have pretty much ignored it. The 1955 Best Hugo was instead given to Mark Clifton and Frank Riley's *They'd Rather Be Right* (later [regarded by some](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jan/29/aliteraryargumentagainstde) as the ""worst book ever to win the Hugo Award"") and the 1956 award to Robert A. Heinlein's *Double Star*.

*The Lord of the Rings* retained a somewhat low profile until 1965, when Ace Books used a copyright loophole to issue an unauthorised American paperback edition of the book in its original three volumes. A legal kerfuffle and fan backlash followed which eventually led to the issuing of an authorised paperback edition and Ace Books agreeing to pay royalties on their pirated version of the book. The ""war over Middle-earth"" made national headlines and catapulted the book to superstardom, as it was then picked up by young British and American readers and became part (not entirely to Tolkien's approval) of the 1960s counter-culture movement.

In 1966, the Hugo Awards introduced a one-off ""Best All-Time Series"" category. It was widely assumed by many (but most notably Isaac Asimov) that the award was introduced solely to reward *The Lord of the Rings* and to make up for the book's initial publication being overlooked. Surprisingly, the award went instead to Asimov's **Foundation Trilogy**, as it then was. Although few could argue with anything remotely approaching a straight face that Asimov's work was of greater literary merit, it was inarguably Science Fiction with a capital S and a capital F, and Tolkien's fantasy was once again left out in the cold.

With J.R.R. Tolkien dying in 1973, it would appear that his chances of winning a Hugo would have been reduced to zero. However, his life's work and what he regarded as his *magnum opus*, *The Silmarillion*, remained unpublished. Working to his directions, his son and literary executor Christopher Tolkien, assisted by future fantasy author (and likewise inexplicably non-winning, and even more inexplicably, non-shortlisted) Guy Gavriel Kay, organised *The Silmarillion* into a publishable form and the book was released in 1977. Although ""difficult"" and unusual in structure, *The Silmarillion* received critical praise and modest commercial success, and would seem to have been a shoe-in for the 1978 Hugo Award.

Instead, it didn't even make the shortlist: Frederick Pohl's *Gateway* won the award and was joined by nominees Marion Zimmer Bradley (*The Forbidden Tower*), Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (*Lucifer's Hammer*), Gordon R. Dickson (*Time Storm*) and some obscure guy called George R.R. Martin (for his debut novel, *Dying of the Light*).

*The Silmarillion* not even being nominated would seem unlikely, and it turns out that it actually *was* nominated and may have even got enough votes to make the shortlist, but [it was kept out by pedantry](http://file770.com/barkley-so-glad-you-didnt-ask-a-column-of-unsolicited-opinions-52/?fbclid=IwAR14t1g9s5WVdpCRYq501IJlCdWfOEwE94ibW0fZv1pt-u4VVty24_lkGwQ#comment-1207868): a man named Jim Corrick who was in charge of eligibility that year deemed that *The Silmarillion* was a short story collection containing a novel-length work (the *Quenta Silmarillion*) and thus if people had specifically nominated the *Quenta Silmarillion*, it would have made the shortlist, but since they didn't, it didn't.

It seems that at this point interest in getting Tolkien a Hugo Award evaporated: *Unfinished Tales* and its constituent stories were not nominated in 1981, and none of the twelve volumes of **The** **History of Middle-earth** was nominated for Best Related Work. *The Children of Hurin* (2008), *Beren and Luthien* (2017) and *The Fall of Gondolin* (2018) would have been of questionable eligibility, since they were repackaged material that had been previously published many years earlier. However, a case could have been made for them and for the latter two making the entire Middle-earth legendarium eligible for the Hugo Award for Best Series, but it seems no attempt was made.

Tolkien himself was probably vaguely aware of the Hugo Awards. He was a fan of Isaac Asimov's fiction in the 1950s and 1960s, and during the tussle with Ace Books, he had been in communication with the SFWA (Science Fiction Writers of America) over the matter. He also had built up an extensive body of correspondence with American fans of his work. It is, however, unlikely that he spent a huge amount of time worrying about not winning awards. The immense fan recognition of his work and the resulting ""grosser forms of literary success"" as he put it (i.e. lots of money) was reward in itself. 

Still, although Tolkien himself never won a Hugo, adaptations of his work finally did. Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* won the last-ever Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 2002, and *The Two Towers* and *The Return of the King* won the first Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation (Long Form) in 2003 and 2004 respectively. And the list of ""influential writers who never won a Hugo Award"" is distinguished company, also consisting of Gene Wolfe, Terry Pratchett and Iain Banks (among many others).",Fantasy

1563040610.0,I'm giving up on Wheel of Time after the 6th book. Just can't do it anymore,"Ok time for a bit of a rant. First things first, I'll acknowledge the first question most likely to come up: why did I even read through 6 books in a series I didn't like? Well, I really wanted to like WoT. The potential was there for it to be great and you can't go two threads in this sub without someone bringing it up as one of the great epic series, so I really wanted to like it.

But unfortunately, no matter how much I tried, I can't do it. IN MY OPINION WoT is terrible, and I find the overwhelming praise it gets on r/fantasy pretty baffling. There are *some* good things about it, but they are far overshadowed by what's *not* good. Here's what I liked:

\- Worldbuilding is solid. There's a deep lore and history in this world and most of it is fairly interesting - in fact, the history is more interesting than the current events.

\- Some nice battle scenes. Dumai Wells in particular was great and probably the high-point of the whole series up till now for me

\- Mat is great. I'd read a separate series just about him without his idiot friends.

Now for what I *didn't* like:

\- The characters. Oh boy, the characters are absolutely terrible (other than Mat). The female characters especially so. Reading through these books, it occurred to me - has Robert Jordan ever met a normal woman in his life? Because based on the female characters in his books, the only girls he's come across are annoying, mean and petty shrews that only exist to insult men and tear each other down. The female characters are HORRID. Nynaeve in particular is one of the most obnoxious, grating characters I've come across in fantasy. The male characters aren't much better. Rand is the very definition of the bland, uninteresting farm boy-saves-the-world type of character. No one else is all that much more interesting. Perrin is clueless and frowns a lot. Moiraine's bodyguard, I forget his name, is your cliched stoic badass. Characters make or break a book for me, fantasy or otherwise, and is the biggest reason I just cannot with WoT

\- The sexual politics and interactions between the male and female characters are just...really weird. They're written in such a juvenile, laughably cringey way, it's like it was written for and  by a teenager. I groaned in embarrassment at some of the descriptions of the interactions between characters. From the female-to-female, or female-to-male interactions - there is just such a weird childish overtone to it all

\- The pacing is excruciatingly slow. I don't mind a slow burn at all, but there has to be interesting things happening. Characters need to be growing and developing. None of that here. I feel like for like a good 80% of the entirety of the 6 books, nothing actually *happened*. Everything significant happens in the last few chapters and the rest of it is reading about a bunch of annoying, unlikable characters in their childish little myopic worlds

\- The story/plot is cliched and not really that interesting. It's yet another lowly nobody and his plucky comrades become uber strong badasses because magic and fights he Dark Lord. There no interesting spin to it, no personality. It's just supersized, stretched out and bloated. The Seanchan were probably the only interesting wrinkle in the story

\- The writing is functional at best. I don't need Gene Wolfe or Patricia McKillip level prose in every novel, but it'd be nice to have some beautiful language everything else sucks. Kingkiller had a shitty story and characters too, but Rothfuss could write like a motherfucker. WoT doesn't even have that. Sanderson's prose sucks too but at least his stories are fun and exciting, usually.

In the end, it's really my fault, for continuing to hit my head against the wall (and these brick-sized tomes) over and over again hoping it'd get better. Looking back, I can't see or think of a bigger waste of time in my life than reading these 6 books.

Some moments are hard, but I know those moment will turn into fond memories as time passes. I can't stress enough how much this community meant to him, we didn't trust a lot of people to tell us what to read... but we trusted you. 

mods, I hope this is ok. My bud was an active follower of the sub. I don’t know how often he posted here, but we shared posts with each other all the time. As you can see, the books we all post about, and the active authors in this community were a big part of his life. While not related to any single piece of literature or author, I thought this was an appropriate thing to share with our community. 

A few weeks ago I lost a very close friend. I don’t feel comfortable sharing his name, so I’ll call him Rain. 

He struggled with depression for years and passed away in mid-May. I’m posting this here because, while him and I shared many interests, Fantasy literature was the thing that connected us most closely. 

In many ways Rain was the single greatest influence on my reading. 

We had been friendly for a while, but about 10 years we found out that we both loved fantasy literature. We shared suggestions and compared notes as we made our way through each others’ favorite series. I remember how excited he was when I finished The Black Company. I think it was the first time he found someone, outside of his family, to share this stuff with. 

He suggested The Black Company, Night Angel, and Riyria, to name a few. 

And then he told me to read Name of the Wind. Unbeknownst to me, he hadn’t read it, but for some reason, was interested in my opinion. I read it, and loved it. I googled “books like…” and found this sub-Reddit. In turn, I shared it with him. What a door that opened. 

We devoured countless new, to us, authors, GGK hit me the hardest. For him, it was Lawrence (more on this later). At first, we read on our own and suggested books we finished. Eventually, we started reading the same book at the same time. One of the first was Hawkins, Library at Mount Char. We loved it, literally sharing random texts about it for years after reading it. 

With Lawrence, we read most of the books together, like a two person book club. The Impossible Times books ripped out our hearts. They are so beautiful and, at times, so sad. Rain was not usually an emotional person, but those got to him. He read chapter 16 of the first book 3 times before moving on. It seems crazy that I know that, but the chapter spoke to him so deeply that we talked about it for years. 

We also bought The Book of the Ancestor novels as they were released and read them all when Holy Sister came out. We literally read the first line of the first book prior to release and committed to the trilogy. “It is important, when killing a nun, to ensure that you bring an army of sufficient size. For Sister Thorn of the Sweet Mercy Convent Lano Tacsis brought two hundred men.” 

We were doing the same with the Book of Ice. It breaks my heart to know I won’t be reading this with him. 

A few weeks before he died he sent me screen shots of an AMA Mark Lawrence did. Mark responded to some of Rain’s questions and he was thrilled. He was such a huge fan and has so much respect for Mark that it meant the world to him. Mark, if you read this, he was a “massive” fan and we loved sharing your stories. 

Marks reply sparked a conversation about the Books of Bable. We read the first novel right before Josiah Bancroft went to Orbit. I have been saving them for book 4 but Rain read them as they released. He wanted to talk about them and was giving be grief for waiting. 

Last week Benedict Patrick shared that the cover was released for book 4 and I instantly pulled up a text for Rain. He had passed away a week before, but texting him about this stuff is (was) second nature to me. 

Speaking of Orbit. Him and I went to NY Comic Con every year, and we spent an abnormally long time in the publishers second. The  plush carpet helped, but really it was our love of books. At the Orbit booth this amazing rep sold us hard on Broken Earth. Rain bought the trilogy from her, but we shelved it for a few years. He started on a whim and called me immediately. “Jemisin writes a POV in SECOND person. You have to start this, now.” I could tell he was serious. I put my Drizzit novel on pause and picked up The Fifth Season. I had the same knee jerk reaction to text him when I read that Sony was adapting it. 

I could go on, but you all get the point. I lost someone very close to me and it was our love of reading, specifically fantasy, that connected us. 

I guess I just wanted to post this here to thank this community. The mods, the people posting, those commenting and all of our amazing authors. This community provided Rain and I with an endless supply of stories to read and share. It hurts now, when I read a post that I would normally send to him, but I’m sure that, in time, that pain will turn into gratitude. Gratitude to have had a friend that I shared such an important thing with. These stories you tell, the ones we share with each-other, the recommendations and criticisms… all of it, it gave him so much joy. It’s reassuring to know it will continue on and that it will always remind me of him. 

So thank you all.",Fantasy

This annoys me. Because first of all, how are the characters supposed to _measure_ 15 minutes? Are they wearing wristwatches? More importantly, how are they even familiar with the concept of minutes? How have they gotten the habit of measuring time in minutes?

As I see it, if you grew up without easy access to clocks, you wouldn't _think_ in minutes. You might know what _hours_ are, because there might be something like hourglasses or church bells that ring every hour. And when you have an idea of what an hour is, you might be able to roughly estimate half an hour or even a quarter of an hour, but nothing more precise than that. And I think the average person's estimate of ""a quarter of an hour"" will be extremely unreliable.

When characters think and talk in terms of minutes, it yanks me out of the story and makes the worldbuilding seem sloppy.",Fantasy

1644159488.0,"WHEEL OF TIME renewed for a third season at Amazon, with a fourth in the offing","**The Wheel of Time** has been renewed for a third season at Amazon Prime Video, with a pickup for a fourth season also potentially on the way.

The news, somewhat obliquely, came [in a Deadline article](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7703856341303488608/4104348301820021767#) discussing the return of **Criminal Minds**. As cast-watchers should be aware, **Wheel of Time** star Daniel Henney was a regular on both **Criminal Minds** and one of its spin-offs for several years. During the article, Deadline confirms that **Wheel of Time** has been picked up for ""two more seasons.""

It's unclear whether Deadline was including the already-filming Season 2, which wraps in the next few weeks, in their count. If not, **Wheel of Time** will make it to fourth season, halfway through its planned eight-season run. If not, the show will definitely get a third year.

This is a bit of a no-brainer. Despite a mixed critical reception, especially its divisive season finale, **Wheel of Time** became Amazon's biggest-ever TV premiere when it launched in November, outperforming the likes of **The Boys**, **Carnival Row**, **The Grand Tour** and **Invincible**. Greenlighting a third season well ahead of a time will be essential to keep the gap between the second and third seasons to a minimum, and greenlighting a fourth season would be advantageous in allowing the production team to plan out future episodes and storylines, as well as creating a schedule that works with their much in-demand lead actor, Rosamund Pike.

Amazon have not yet confirmed the news, but Deadline (along with Variety and the Hollywood Reporter) is usually very on the ball with this kind of news.

Season 2 of **The Wheel of Time** is expected to air late this year or early next.",Fantasy

1669079767.0,I finished Harry Potter and I feel disappointed,"Harry Potter has always existed peripherally in my mind. I never caught up with the hype as a kid and as an adult, the fans soured me on it with how overly maudlin they were about both the series and Jk Rowling as a person. But ever since Rowling came out as TERF, there seems to have been a huge reactionary push to either see Harry Potter as the most intricately written piece of modern literature and if you criticize it, you're wrong and only criticizing it because you're bitter about Rowling. Or it's a humungous piece of shit and you're a piece of shit for liking them.

Starting a few months back, I decided to finally read all seven books. And....they're fine. But that's just it; they're just fine. They aren't dogshit but  I genuinely do not understand the insane amount of hype that these books generated. Especially the sheer amount of adults that act like this is the only book series aimed at children that has dipped into dark themes.

Books 1-3 are genuinely good mystery books for kids. The writing is digestible, the tone is light and the world is very fun and whimsical. Book 3 is by far the best in the whole series. Around Book 4, when Rowling decided to make them more realistic, the world kind of falls apart and loses what made it good. Book 5 had a bad central mystery but made up for the great characterizations of Sirius and Harry. Half-Blood Prince is one of the most boring fantasy books I've read. And Deathly Hallows was a cluster fuck of clunkily done Christian allegories, Harry acting like a psychotic asshole to everyone around him, the main trio using unforgivable curses with no repercussions, and dues ex Machina wand lore.

The biggest problem I have is that books started on a shallow premise of a Roald Dahl-esque wizard where kids go to wizard middle school and Rowling attempts to squeeze a YA dark, political fantasy out of that in the later books. The magic system is whatever the plot calls for in that book. And that works for the whimsical, rubber hose logic the earlier books run off of. It makes no sense in the later books.

The same goes for the other intrigues of the world. In a children's book series, I can have a suspension of disbelief when it comes to Hogwarts and its staff. In a realistic setting, Hogwarts is a dangerous hellhole and its staff is either incompetent morons or child abusers. And Rowling never attempts to mend the gap by jumping to a more serious tone. So the later books have this tug-of-war between being a fanciful series for small children and an overly somber, grim fantasy series for tweens.

When Rowling does attempt include serious topics and themes, she comes off as a very sheltered person who hasn't been outside of their insulated town. The analogies to real-world socio-political problems are at best confusing and at worst, offensive. I don't even know what she was trying to say with the whole house-elf thing. The house elves are intentionally written as sympathetic beings who are abused by wizarding society. And yet every-time Hermione brings it up, Harry or Ron rolls their eyes and it's portrayed like it's one of Hermione's annoying quirks.

The ""Werewolves are a stand-in for people with HIV"" was the most egregious to me personally. They are only two named Werewolves in the series; Remus Lupin, the depressed but kind mentor figure to Harry who resents being a werewolf. And Fenrir Greyback; a cannibalistic, rapist, pedophile who purposefully targets kids to infect. I can't tell if this Rowling is this obtuse or not but it's pretty fucking awful that her HIV allegory plays into a stereotype that still affects HIV victims.

A lot of the good female characters are reduced to either being love interests or moms. Hermione, Luna, and Mcgonagall are the only female characters that come to mind whose lives are not molded around the male characters. And even then, Hermione is often portrayed as this overly nagging mom friend to Ron and Harry. Ginny is pretty much absent for three books and then comes back in book 6 to become Harry's manic pixie dream girl. Tonks gets downgraded to being a catalyst for Remus's angst in book 7. And if they are villains, a lot of Rowling's internalized misogyny comes out. They're overly feminine which I guess to Rowling is a horrible trait to have. 

As for Snape...he's not the intricately woven ""gray"" character like a lot of people said. I understand that this point has been beaten into the ground. But Snape is a cartoon, Roald Dahl-esque villain for the majority of the books. And in the last book, the narrative plays Snape's obsession as a heroic quality about him and not insanely weird and a piss-poor motivation. He's a poorly written Byronic hero and that has somehow translated into meaning that he's a deeply profound character.

Idk, I guess expected a lot more from it based on how people talk about it. There are some beautiful lines of dialogue and Rowling's is good at making character's feel like real people when feels like it. But I feel like a lot of the hype and fawning around Harry Potter comes from nostalgia, the movies, and the humungous advertisement campaign in the early 2000s rather than the quality of the books.",Fantasy

1601082822.0,"Opinion: The ""classic"" fantasy setting isn't Medieval, it's Roman with Medieval costumes","*EDIT: Wow, this got more attention than I expected, both positive and negative. Four awards on one side (thanks, guys!) and a lot of intense (and usually valid) criticism in the comments on the other, often because I didn't express myself very well. Let me see if I can clear some things up:*

1. *Fantasy usually isn't trying to be based on any specific era. That's why it's fantasy---it's meant to be unreal and unusual. I would argue that most of the time, fantasy settings are based on Medieval tropes; that's what I'm reacting to. Stories that are only loosely and accidentally based on these themes---like the Inheritance Cycle---are just as valid and enjoyable as ones deliberately trying to emulate them---like the Traitor Son Cycle. The Middle Ages really are fun; I'm just suggesting that the classic fantasy setting has less in common with that period than people usually realize.*
2. *This post is intended to be a lighthearted attempt to spark discussion, not an academic statement. In that vein, many points are gross over-generalizations; history is complex, and both the Middle Ages and the Roman state existed for about 1000 years each. If I were to be more specific, I'm referring to Western Europe in the High Middle Ages (though I reference Constantinople at one point) and the Late Western Roman Empire.*
3. *Related to the last point: I am not a professional historian for either of these eras. This post comes from about six months of research on my free time, mostly about Roman history. There are many things that I haven't yet discovered, especially about Medieval Europe. Feel free to let me know what I got wrong, especially if you can let me know where to learn more. If you'd like some sources, my most recently-read books are The Roman Army by Pat Southern, The Logistics of the Roman Army at War by Jonathan Roth, De Militari by Vegetius, and De Medicus by Celsus; the other sources have been looked at too long ago for me to remember off the top of my head.*

*Thank you so much for your support and input!*

I wish I could come up with a better description of what I mean by ""classic"" fantasy setting; of course now that I've started writing this, most of the examples I had in my head have left. All I've got left is Lord of the Rings, the Inheritance Cycle, Elder Scrolls games, and Witcher series. Hopefully over the course of this post it'll make more sense.

So I've been doing a lot of research lately on Medieval and ancient societies---especially warfare---to make my stories more life-like. As part of that, I've discovered that a strictly Medieval setting is pretty restrictive, while shifting focus to the Roman Empire loosens things up a bit.

&#x200B;

Here are some of the pesky elements of the Medieval period:

* Complex and constraining social systems of feudalism and manorialism (who wants to deal with the intricacies of corvee labor?)
* Poor agricultural technology leads to low urbanization (in 1100 Constantinople was one of the biggest cities at 200,000 people) and career diversity (only 1 in 10 people *weren't* farmers)
* Strict monotheistic religion (not that big of a problem, but most classic settings prefer polytheism)
* Warfare (one of my favorites)
   * Small army sizes (usually \~10,000 max) and no standing army
   * Soldiers are often levies of peasants with swords supported by nobles on horses
   * No standardized units, formations, or complex tactics
   * Bizarre and confusing chains of command (one of the reasons the French lost at Agincourt was because the nobles couldn't decide who was in charge) with no soldier ranks
   * Little to no logistical support or organization

&#x200B;

Now let's go into all of the fun things that become possible if we go with the Roman Empire:

* Relatively loose social and political systems, even a primitive version of nations and sovereignty
* More advanced agricultural technology allows higher urbanization (at its height, Rome had 500,000 people) and career diversity (4 non-farmers out of 10 people)
* Polytheistic religion with acceptance of local variants
* Warfare
   * Massive standing armies (the British Isles alone had over 50,000 soldiers in 135 AD)
   * Career soldiers that build their entire professional lives around war
   * Highly standardized units and formations; military manuals discussing tactics and other aspects of war
   * Clear chain of command with ranks and officers
   * Developed logistics with supply lines and corps of engineers, medical personnel, and other specialists

&#x200B;

Now, there are some fun bits of the Medieval Era that can be adopted by the classic fantasy setting:

* Clothes and manners of speech
* Noble titles (royalty, peerage, knights, etc.)
* Mythological inspiration (dragons, fae, etc.)
* Weapons, armor, and other military technology (siege weapons, castles, etc.)

&#x200B;

So if you're like me and like to base your tales on what's realistically possible (ignore the magic and monsters), don't look at Medieval Europe---look at the Roman Empire. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.",Fantasy

1603214974.0,Guide for recommending Malazan,"This is not a final say on the matter, I would be glad if others expanded the list or challenged some of the points I made. No spoilers here.

***I want to read an epic fantasy story with huge scope*** \-  Yes, easy recommend. It takes place on several continents with many different characters. Scope is what Malazan is about.

***I want to read about deep fantasy characters, to really get to know them and intimately understand them*** \- Pass. Malazan has great characters. Some of my favorite characters in all of fiction. But character work is done very differently compared to other books. Erikson recently made a Facebook essay on the subject of characterization, and while I completely agree with him, I understand why people find his character work off-putting.

***I want a book with a lot of lore and worldbuilding that is intertwined with the main plot*** \- Easy recommend. Malazan is all about lore, history and mythology.

***I am tired of long series and getting into a ten books series is too much for me right now*** \- Recommend. That is right. There is a misconception about Malazan and that is if you start it you have to finish all 10 books. In reality, it starts with two duologies. Gardens of the Moon + Memories of Ice ( War on Genebackis) and Deadhouse Gates + House of Chains ( Apocalypse Uprising in Seven Cities ) both following mostly different characters on different continents pursuing different goals. Hardcore fans insist to read them in order and that only after all 10 you can properly grasp the series. But I would say you can read a duology and get the feeling of what the series is about. If you don't like it , you won't like the rest.

***I want a grimdark book*** \- Pass. It can be dark with lots of death, torture, war, even body horror. But it is not grimdark it its themes. This series is all about compassion, hope and surprisingly, friendship. My friend once called it ""Malazan Friendship is Magic"", and I thought, well he is not wrong.

***I want a lighthearted reading experience*** \- Pass. While ultimate message is about compassion, to prove that point Erikson choses to put your character through some stuff. And people go through some really horrifying stuff. It is never a fun adventure. It is war, start to finish.

***I want a book with romance*** \- Hard Pass. Just don't. No.

***I want a book with bromance*** \- Easy recommend. People have such intimate friendships that you will wish your friends are like that. Tehol and Bugg, Gesler and Stormy, Toc and Tool, Icarium and Mappo etc. Some of these made me tear up. Easily one of the best parts of the series.

***I want a book with fast pacing and lots of action*** \- Pass. Pacing can be slow. People will take several chapters to arrive at a location. But, things are always happening. That is why it is described as dense. You are always fed new information, new events, new characters etc. So while slow sometimes, it is never boring. Action is really good but action scenes can be few and far between.

***I want a book with classic fantasy tropes/ storylines*** \- Pass. While some tropes are present, usually they are either deconstructed or rejected altogether.

***I want a book with classic races*** \- Pass. All races here are straight out of Erikson's mind, some may resemble classic races in some ways, but are their own thing.

***I want a book with a diverse cast*** \- Recommend. People of different races, cultures, creeds etc. interact and work together.

***I want a book with a hard magic system*** \- Pass. Magic system is soft, fans still try to figure out exactly how it worked in some instances in books. It works because it adds a layer of mystery to the world and a sense of awe when someone unleashes their power, but it also means that with magic in Malazan, anything goes.

***I want a book where men and women are equal*** \- Recommend. Everyone can learn to use magic in this world both men and women , Malazan empire has an Empress (she did not get her position through marriage), part of her army led by her female adjunct, among Malaz marines you can find both men and women fighting etc.

***I want a book with a small cast, it is hard for me to follow too many people*** \- Pass. It has a total of 690 characters. I know Erikson did it to add to the sense of it being a true world, and he came as close as possible in fiction, but damn, it comes at a price.

***I want a book with atheistic themes*** \- Pass. Gods are real in Malazan, they are characters themselves, often interacting with mortals.

***I want a military fantasy book*** \- Recommend. It is full of war, tactics, army compositions, geography and maps.

***I want a book that will make me emotional*** \- Recommend. One of the few series that made me tear up.

***I want series with larger than life characters*** \- Hard recommend. Some of the coolest Gods, demigods, generals, warriors, wizards go all out, and it is glorious to behold.

***I want a book with great dialogue*** \- Pass. Some dialogue is great while other times it can be a bit stiff. Mixed bag overall.

***I want a book with lots of exposition and I like having things explained to me -*** Hard pass. No exposition here. For better or worse.

***I want books that escalate towards the end*** \- Recommend. Convergence of power is a big theme. At the end of each book powers converge and shit goes down.

***I want a book with great prose*** \- Maybe. Here the prose is hit or miss with some people. I hated it at first, but now it is my favorite hands down. Only way to describe it is through example. (sorry if it's bad I am no writer)

1. Average fantasy book: Ned, an immortal demigod, now the outcast of the holy order he served, saw a sandwich on the table in front of him. Hunger gripped his stomach, his mouth watering at the sight of that juicy bacon. He had to approach it, even though he knew he would be punished for stealing. Alas, hunger got the better of him and he went for it.
2. Erikson: He entered the room, only to see a sandwich laid out on the table in front of him. Was he so famished that he would break the sacred oath he made a millennia ago? He did not know. He only knew that with strange eons passing he would become enslaved to his material form, now bitter and an old shell of his former self, no sandwich in the Seven Cities could satiate his hunger. Yet for the time being, this would have to suffice.

***I want a book with political intrigue -*** Pass. There is a bit of it but it's not in the spotlight.

***I want to get into fantasy*** \- Pass. It could get overwhelming for a new reader.

***I like assassins*** \- Recommend. Erikson likes them too. Mage assassins, spy assassins, guild assassins, thief assassins, army assassins, anti-army assassins etc.

***I don't like the author killing characters*** \- Pass. People will die but it is usually done very well.

***I don't like having too many POVs*** \- Pass. There are a few too many here if you ask me.

***I want a book with good humor, actually funny comic relief -*** Recommend. Deadhouse Gates is the first book where I actually laughed out loud.

***I want a book where battles are actually exciting -*** Recommend. You will usually be in the thick of the action, as well as getting a nice overview of what is happening.

***I want a book with dragons, shapeshifters, beasts and other fantasy creatures*** \-  Recommend. Yes. Malazan has sentient dragons and other fantasy creatures that play a role in the story, not just there for decoration.

***I want you to stop, this post is way too long. -*** Recommend. I will stop, just a few more. People might find this helpful.

***Dude...***

1627989297.0,"My name is Michael J. Sullivan, author of the Riyria novels, Legends of the First Empire, and my new series (The Rise and Fall) releases today with Nolyn - AMA!","Hey all,

I'm Michael J. Sullivan, and I'm a New York Times, USA Today, and Washington Post bestselling author of four series and one standalone tale. All told that's two completed series, one ongoing, and the start of my latest series begins releasing today! That's **20 books** in all, which seems kinda crazy when I think about it.

I've been a member of r/fantasy for over 13 years, won 2 Stabby awards, and this is my 7th AMA's (I can't believe the last one was so long ago).  I'm thrilled to be with you all today. What amazing growth this forum has had over the years, and I'm always grateful for the amazing support my books have had here.

As for my writing, I'm what's referred to as a hybrid author -- someone who has worked with traditional publishers as well as self-produced indie works. Many people think I started out in the indie world, but that's not quite true.  My first book was released in 2008 by a very small press (AMI - Aspirations Media Inc), but it sold very few copies (and ultimately I didn't earn a dime from it), but because my wife is a savvy businesswoman, we switched to self-publishing in 2009 when the publisher didn't have the money to produce the print run for the second book.  By 2010, the self-publishing gig was going well, so we tried for traditional publishing, and it worked.  I've published 8 books with Orbit  3 with Del Rey, 1 with Tachyon Publishing, and 13 through self-publishing.  These days I'm 100% indie (and if you want to know why, just ask - this is an AMA after all.

As for what I've written - here's how it breaks down:

* **The Riyria Revelations** (completed and published by Orbit it's a 6-book series sold in 3, 2-book Omnibus editions: Theft of Swords | Rise of Empire | Heir of Novron)
* **The Riyria Chronicles** (1/2 published by Orbit and 1/2 indie produced is my ongoing series): The Crown Tower | The Rose and the Thorn | The Death of Dulgath | The Disappearance of Winter's Daughter). Next up in that series will be Drumindor (but I don't have a release date yet)
* **Legends of the First Empire** (completed and 1/2 published by Del Rey and 1/2 indie produced) Age of Myth | Age of Swords | Age of War | Age of Legend | Age of Death | Age of Empyre
* **The Rise and Fall Trilogy** (indie published which is releasing a book a year each summer of 2021, 2022, 2023: Nolyn | Farilane | Esrahaddon)
* **Hollow World:** Standalone sci-fi time-travel thriller

My fantasy audiobooks are narrated by the amazing Tim Gerard Reynolds, and the cover designs feature Marc Simonetti. My wife is my business partner and knows A LOT about publishing and the business side of writing. She's graciously volunteered to join me in the AMA so if you have any questions for Robin, just mark them as such.

Since today is release day for Nolyn, I should mention a bit about it.  Here's the ""back of the book"" marketing blurb:

After more than five hundred years of exile, the heir to the empyre is wary about his sudden reassignment to active duty on the Goblin War’s front lines. His mission to rescue an outpost leads to a dead-end canyon deep inside enemy territory, and his suspicion turns to dread when he discovers the stronghold doesn't exist. But whoever went to the trouble of planning his death to look like a casualty of war didn't know he would be assigned to the Seventh Sikaria Auxiliary Squadron. In the depths of an unforgiving jungle, a legend is about to be born, and the world of Elan will never be the same.

I'll be back around throughout the day to answer questions, and if I don't get through them all by the time the day is over, I'll answer them over the next few days. Feel free to ask anything it can be about writing, publishing, the book business as a whole, or my books in particular. But please do use spoiler tags so others can visit this thread without fear of finding out something they would rather read about in the books.

EDIT: It's past midnight here and way past my bedtime. I'll be back to clean up any questions I missed, and to answer any new ones that come in. But thainks, all, for a day of fun ""hanging out with yall.""  As I head off to bed, the release is going well. The Audiobook is in the top 10 of all audiobooks  (#1 in Fantasy, Epic Fantasy, and Historical fantasy).  The ebook is at 462 - quite respectable for this stage of the release. Combined with the amazing Kickstarter (raised ore than $200,000 in pre-order sales), we can safely say Nolyn has had an awesome release.",Fantasy

[Information requested: how to read all of Will Wight's books without giving him a dime. 

Beginning report...]

**Will Wight Giveaway**, celebrating ten years of writing! By series (US Amazon):

Traveler's Gate Trilogy - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CCBXYZ

Traveler's Gate Side Stories - https://www.amazon.com/Travelers-Gate-Chronicles-Complete-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00Z92K3PG

Elder Empire Trilogy (Shadow) - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CCVM2J

Elder Empire Trilogy (Sea) - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074C78XPJ

The Last Horizon - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C11YDHB8

Cradle - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0753FP6SP

**Traveler's Gate** is progression-adjacent fantasy following the friend of the chosen one. **Elder Empire** is this weird dual trilogy (each book has a counterpart from the other side happening at the same time) with eldritch horror themes. **Last Horizon** is the newest series with just one book so far, science fantasy following a wizard-with-a-gun as he puts together a team to pilot an ancient spaceship.

**Cradle** is the main thing he's famous for, a super fast paced western Xianxia series about a boy going from crippled to OP, in a genre where people regularly go around punching the local equivalent of gods. Eleven books out so far, and the last will be out in a week. Generally considered the flagship series of the r/progressionfantasy subgenre, you cannot go more than half a thread there without someone recommending Cradle.

Edit: a note on the **audiobooks** from u/cwil40 -

>Worth adding that after “purchasing” for $0 you can add Audible audio for $1.99 on each of these books.
>
>Edit to add: Pro-tip, don’t “purchase” the kindle versions that are bundles of 3 novels. Buy them all individually. Once you have purchased a book, the following screen (where it says “thank you for purchasing xyz”) should give you the option to “add whispersync audio” or “add audible narration” and this should cost $1.99 per book.

Edit2: The giveaway should also work on non-US Amazon sites if you find his author page, e.g. [Canada](https://www.amazon.ca/Will-Wight/e/B00D9S1IMO), [Germany](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Will-Wight/e/B00D9S1IMO), [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Will-Wight/e/B00D9S1IMO)

1599907924.0,*Willow* (1988) deserves more appreciation.,"Willow is one of the very best ""high fantasy"" movies. It has a great, if predictable, plot with some memorable performances and effects that hold up exceptionally well for a movie made over a quarter of a century ago. 

And yet this movie gets zero love. 

Its a dark and at times even grisly film. It has mystery and enchantment. Love and battle. A typical good vs evil arch but it also cleverly and believably portrays hate and cruelty contested by friendship, love, and furthermore, redemption. I think Willow has some of the very best character growth in a fantasy movie, much less one supposed to be for children. 

Hell its a PG movies but has more red blood in it than the Lord of the Rings movies. And some seriously gruesome effects to boot. Tack on a few objectively incredible battle scenes, a great chase scene, and some comic relief. Its just great. The whole movie is paced wonderfully. And it has a beautifully scored soundtrack. 

And then on top of it all there's Madmartigan. One of the best scoundrel anti heros on film. 

All in all I think Willow deserves higher regard, especially from fantasy fans.


Edit: I didn't mean this to trigger anybody. I simply never hear it talked about any more. Plenty of other ""older"" movies still garner tons of attention. I guess I stand corrected. Also Im 38 and saw Willow at the drive in with my family in 1988 not some kid that thinks he's the the first person to discover the movie. I guess I should have just said Willow is great and if you haven't seen it you should. Glad to know so many others feel the same.",Fantasy

1664452812.0,3000 Books Read Over 15 Years,"Yesterday I just finished the 3000th book since I started tracking which books I read (and when) since June 2007. I thought it might be fun to look back at the last 15 years of reading—numbers and otherwise (if you’re wondering why I think this is fun, please recall that I worked on the r/Fantasy Bingo Statistics posts for 5 years).

In 2007 I created a spreadsheet to to track both my reading as well as all the books I *wanted* to read (and which libraries had the books I wanted). Even though I say it’s 3000 books, there are some things I didn’t count that others might (picture books that I read to my son, no short stories shorter than a novella, and no required readings for university classes), and some things I *do* count that others might not (rereads, manga/comic book volumes, and magazine issues).

[Table of Books Read per Month\/Year](https://preview.redd.it/c4jyeukybqq91.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b63cbc3364d1dd22c0227e050bbffb0bd349b3b)

A few facts you may be able to figure out from above:

* I was in school until spring 2009.
* I didn't get a job until the end of 2010.
* I binged comics/manga like *crazy* in the 5 highest total months above (Jan & Feb 2010, Jan 2011, Oct 2012, and Sep 2013)
* My son was born at the beginning of 2018.
* January and August are my best months on average for reading; April and December are my worst months.

But wait! I have more! (The points below are just stat summaries of the 3000-book totals; I'll discuss some of the changes or trends in the Conclusion section.)

* **Author/Editor Gender:** 59% of books (1775) were written by men, 33% (1000) were written by women, 1% (26) were written by nonbinary authors, and 7% (199) were written by mixed-gender authors (including anthologies edited by men with non-male contributors).
* **Genre:** 78% (2325) of the books I read were speculative fiction (science fiction, fantasy, alternate history, or a mix thereof), 15% (439) were not (fiction, historical, mysteries/thrillers, and romances without SF/F elements) , and 8% (237) were nonfiction books (mostly histories).
* **SF:** Of the 2325 SF/F books that I read, 1275 (55%) were clearly fantasy, 778 (33%) were clearly science fiction, and 271 (12%) were a mix of the two (or alternate history without any other SF/F elements).
* **Borrowing:** 59% of books (1779) were from the library or borrowed from a friend.
* **Format:** 73% (2177) were print books; 26% (769) were ebooks, and 2% (54) were audiobooks.
* **Short Fiction:** 304 books (10%) were anthologies, collections, or magazines. 194 books (6%) were novellas. While I don't have historical data for individual short stories I've read not included above, I started this year, and I have 32 stories read so far, nearly all as one-offs from magazines or newsletters.
* **Graphic Novels/Manga:** 930 (31%) were graphic novels, manga, or comic collections (no single issues or chapters).
* **Translations:** 16% (489) were translated books or included translated stories. Only 19% of those translations (93) weren’t comics. I don’t currently track the original language, but I think a vast majority are from Japanese.
* **Series:** 2005 (67%) were part of a series, with 501 books were the first in their respective series. I had 444 (15%) standalone novels. (I didn’t count nonfiction or magazines “series”).
* **Debut Novels:** 209 (7%) were debut novels (I tried not to include debut novellas or collections, just first novels).
* **Rereads:** 218 (7%) were rereads.
* **How Soon I Read a Book:** 2% (63) were read within a week of publication; 246 (8%) within 2 months; 664 (22%) within a year, and 41% (1216) were read within 3 years of publication.

**CONCLUSION**

One thing that the stat summaries hide is how differently I read in recent years. The last 7 years I actually read an average of 50% books as ebooks, even though my overall numbers since 2007 show half that percentage. I only got my first e-reader in 2012, and it took a few years before I realized my library had ebooks to drive that number up. I also only started listening to audiobooks in the last 4 years, and I listen to about 13 per year (and only nonfiction audiobooks).

Another statistic that surprised me was my gender ratio (59 M/33 F). I would say that the last 5 years I’m reading more like equal numbers or even more women than men, but those early years really put me in a hole so to speak. Unfortunately, a lot of the American comics I’ve read tend to be written by male authors, so those numbers really tilt one way, especially if it’s a series I binge (most of the U.S. comics I’ve read by women/nonbinary people have been standalone or trilogies).

A fun thing I’ve enjoyed in looking at my spreadsheet statistics is seeing what appears to be a large or small number and trying to figure out what’s causing it in particular. For example, I tend not to reread very many books (I only have 3 for 2022), but I had large jumps in 2012 (Fullmetal Alchemist & Wheel of Time), 2014 (Dresden Files), and 2020 (Valdemar). I also had a random surge of books from the 1920s-40s in 2012, and that was just because of Agatha Christie.

I also noticed that I started reading about 48-60% newer books (within the last 3 years) for 2014-19 and then also 2021. Last year (2021) was because of reading for the Hugos for the first time, but I’m still not quite sure why I started reading more recent fiction for 2014-19. That might have been when I got more active on r/Fantasy or started following more book bloggers.

I was amused to see certain authors on my top list as some of them I haven’t read in ages, such as the 72 manga volumes from Clamp, as I haven’t read them in over 9 years, and they’re still my top overall. It’s been almost 6 years since I’ve read anything by David Weber, and over 11 since I’ve read Alan Dean Foster.

Anyway, all of the above is just a snapshot into my reading life, and I hope it proves interesting to some. Happy to answer any questions or look up a statistic someone’s interested in.",Fantasy

1612006212.0,Lies of Locke Lamora was best fantasy book I've read since started reading again back in late 2019 and trying many recs from this sub.,"I've been trying to get back into habit of reading, and asked for recommendations. People recommended me Mistborn, Stormlight Archive, Warbreaker, Belgariad, Kingkiller Chronicles, Discworld, Farseer, and while I did enjoy them all so some extent, every one of them had some significant flaw that wouldn't make me see them as one of my favorites.

Some were rather poorly and unimaginatively written, some were too long and bloated despite being not that eventful, some had uncompelling characters, and some were just constantly sad and depressing. Discworld could be an exception as I really loved it, but it's not the kind of story that makes you immersed and really live through it. But I don't want to just complain about them, I did enjoy reading all of them after all.

But recently, I picked up Lies of Locke Lamora, and it really ticked almost all the right boxes.

The writing style complements the story well and greatly helped me visualize events and places without delving onto countless descriptions and details just for the sake of worldbuilding. I also loved how detailed the fight scenes were. The prose is neither too flowery nor robotic, and there's just something about it that really allowed my imagination to actually paint pictures before my eyes.

The pacing is awesome, the book despite its length never drags, and even these flashbacks are very well placed in the context of the main story.

The characters are vivid and their dialogues are stellar, but what I like most about the way they are written is that the author leaves a lot of room for you to fill in the spaces with your imagination while providing some guidelines for their looks, personality etc. Also - show don't tell, one line like ""nice bird, asshole"" in its context tells you 100 times more about Locke than an entire paragraph devoted to describing how pugnacious he is.

The tone is also great (that point is entirely a preference though). It's not grimdark (although i have no idea for the real definition for grimdark), but there are some heavy moments in this book. The difference to some more bleak series is how the characters react to these things happening to them. They don't really wallow in their misery and hopelessness too much, and usually try to overcome it.

It's not a sprawling high fantasy full of wonder and adventure, but for what the author set out to do, it's pretty much perfect (for me of course).

>!I didn't really like that Sanza brothers and Bug died, because their chemistry with each other was  so great, but from the storytelling perspective it made perfect sense, it was a real gut punch and a driving force for Locke and Jean to get revenge.!<

By the way, how the hell was it never made into a movie/tv series (apart from not being yet finished I guess) ? It wouldn't even need a massive budget as there's barely any actual visual magic in it, at least in the first one.

And by the way, I do plan to check out some less popular series soon, instead of just picking everything from the top 10 most popular ones.",Fantasy

1641572338.0,I admit I like The Hobbit more than Lord of the Rings,"I always felt it was kind of funny that The Hobbit gets ignored in most criticisms of Tolkien. I'm an academic with classes in JRR so I get exposed to them more but usually, the surface readings of it always go on about pro-monarchy sentiments and divine rights of kings, fallen ages, and evil races. However, if you read The Hobbit, it actually feels like Tolkien is sending up his own critics' ideas of himself.

Thorin is the one true king of the dwarves and as blue blooded/divine right of kings as they come. He's also a complete ass. Thorin is constantly leading the group into disaster, a frankly terrible leader, and a bit of a coward as he sends Bilbo into the dragon's den first. He also almost ends up in a pointless war with the elves and humans over gold. The Elf King isn't much better and Bard fully intends to march on the Lonely Mountain to rob the joint. Though, to be fair, Bard perhaps has a point that the dwarves brought ruin on his people.

The elves, dwarves, and races of men are traditionally the ""good"" races of fantasy but with the exception of Elrond, they're pretty much always at each other's throats the entirety of the book. What manages to unite men and elves is initially gold and later a mutual threat that is properly portrayed as ragingly hypocritical. The cartoon version always stuck with my 5 year old self that the various leaders immediately sided with one another only when the goblins were at the gates.

(I actually give Tolkien props for the fact that instead of the dwarves being money grubbing gold-lovers like certain stereotypes--it's actually elves, humans, AND dwarves who are greedy sons of bitches)

I also feel like even the treatment of the goblins is softer in The Hobbit than in LOTR. Yes, they're the bad guys but the dwarves and Gandalf murdered their king. They did so because the king was justifiably upset they were carrying around Hate Crime SwordsTM. How would you react?

Indeed, I think this is probably why the Hobbit movies utterly failed for me because the movies lacked any sort of subversive quality to them. It feels weird to read the Hobbit as subversive since it predates modern fantasy as we know it but even then, it was the story of the rotund middle aged useless gentryman instead of the plucky farm boy.",Fantasy

1609517269.0,The Dragons of JRR Tolkien,"Happy New Year everyone!

When it comes to fantasy, it’s hard to imagine that there’s any creature more ubiquitous or universal than the dragon. We have Dungeons and Dragons, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Skyrim, World of Warcraft,...Shrek. It seems wherever you look, if it’s in the fantasy genre, there’s a good chance you’ll find a fire-breathing dragon. And although it would be a definite overstatement to suggest that Tolkien invented dragons as we know them, I do believe that without him, they wouldn’t be so so familiar to the modern reader. I think it can be argued that *Smaug the Golden* is both the first great dragon of contemporary fantasy, and the last great dragon of the old Germanic, Slavic, and wider European mythologies. Smaug is the reason that although you may you struggle to picture a manticore, or a cockatrice, every single one of us knows what a dragon is.  

However, by starting with Smaug, I’m getting a little ahead of myself. Although he is the first dragon Tolkien named in his published works, in the chronology of Middle-earth, he is the last of the great dragons. And there’s a long heritage of monsters that preceded him.

So in the annals of Middle-earth the very first dragon - the father of them all - is the *“Great Worm”* Glaurung. And Glaurung’s date of birth (or hatching) is unknown. His master Morgoth intentionally kept his existence a secret until he was ready to be unleashed upon the unsuspecting Elves. But, as I guess is quite common with rebellious young beings, Glaurung was impatient, and he emerged from his master’s dungeons two hundred years before Morgoth was ready to unveil him. 

However Glaurung's official debut came with the disastrous *Battle of Sudden Flame*, which broke the military supremacy of the Noldor and their allies. And Glaurung was the reason for all this sudden flame. I mean the balrgos helped, but the Father of the Dragons led the largest army of orcs and evil things that the world had ever seen, and the ""*Elves and Men withered before him.""* 

But the Battle of Sudden Flame was just a taste of the horror that Glaurung would eventually unleash. Only seventeen years later came the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and this was arguably the greatest loss ever suffered by the Free Peoples in Middle-earth's history. In this battle, Glaurung once again emerged from Morgoth's fortress, but this time he was not the only one of his kind. Tolkien tells us about Glaurung's brood, which he describes as ""*many and terrible"",* and these children of Glaurung caused immense devastation upon the field of battle. 

Now within Middle-earth, not all dragons are created equal, and as is always the case with Tolkien, there are a few different types of dragons throughout the Legendarium. But Glaurung and his brood are among some of the most dangerous, for they are all of the class of *Urulóki* \- known more commonly as fire-drakes. So as the name suggests, Glaurung and his brood were all endowed with the ability to breathe dragon fire. And dragon fire is no ordinary thing. In *The Lord of the Rings* we're told that it's hot enough to melt Rings of Power. The only other place where that could happen is in the fires of Mount Doom. 

But anyway, in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Glaurung and his brood lay waste to the lands of the Sons of Fëanor, and they *""sweep apart""* the two factions of Elven allies. And when that was done, Glaurung went after Lord Azaghâl, the chief of the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains. And although Azaghâl's Dwarven army hewed Glaurung and sent him into a rage, they were unable to kill him. And when the battle was over, Azaghâl was just another slain hero, who'd met his end in the fires Glaurung. 

And there's something really interesting here, because although in the First Age dragons are portrayed as the destroyers of many mighty Elven armies, and in later Ages they're known as the great enemies of the Dwarves, in Tolkien's entire Legendarium we're not told of a single named dragon who is ever killed by either an elf or a dwarf. Every dragon that dies, is slain by a single mortal Man, standing alone in single combat. 

And this brings us the eventual doom of Glaurung. Now I don't want to unnecessarily spoil anything, because I’ll cover this in much greater detail in future Silmarillion videos, but just like with all future dragons, Glaurung is slain by a mortal Man. And there's no battle. There are no armies. There is simply Glaurung and the son of Húrin. But *before* the hero’s black sword pierces Glaurung's belly, Tolkien demonstrates some of the other lesser known powers of Glaurung the Great Worm. Because although the dragon is most famous for his fiery and poisonous breath, he has another power that proves perhaps even more destructive. 

You see Glaurung is a master of minds. Not unlike Sauron, he uses deception against his enemies, but this is not the limit of what he can do. More than once in the Legendarium he uses his power to hypnotise his enemies, and he freezes them in place. Which renders them completely helpless against him. But even this is not his greatest gift. At one point in the story, Glaurung comes across a young maiden and he uses some sort of spell to utterly obliterate her mind. He destroys her memories. And when he's finished with her, the maiden is left with no idea who she is, why she's there, or even what her name is. And just like most of the tales in the *Children of Húrin*, the story ends really badly for said maiden. 

However, eventually Glaurung is slain, and so he becomes the first in a long line of dragons to be killed by Mannish heroes. Over the Ages he would be joined by the ""*Long-worm""* Scatha who was slain by Fram (an ancestor of the Men of Rohan), the Beast of Gondolin who was vanquished by Tuor (the only Man in a city full of Elves), and of course Smaug who is slain not by dwarves or by wizards or by hobbits, but by Bard the Bowman and his Black Arrow. However of all the dragons in Tolkien's Legendarium, there is one who stands out amongst all others. One dragon who is the greatest of his kind, the mightiest of them all, and the ancestor of all future winged dragons. *Ancalagon the Black.*

So the truth is that we don't know a huge amount about Ancalagon, but we do know that Morgoth bred him to be the greatest dragon that ever lived. And he was unleashed in Morgoth's final hour, during the War of Wrath. Now there is a little bit of debate amongst fans in regards to Ancalagon's size. If you google him you'll probably find an image comparing the sizes of all the dragons in Middle-earth, and Ancalagon will no doubt be outrageously huge. And to be fair, Ancalagon was massive. But he probably wasn't *that* massive. I mean we know that he could fly, and even in a fantasy setting, the laws of physics do have a limit. Although again to be fair, we *are* told that when Ancalagon was cast down, his body fell from the sky and broke all three of the tallest mountains in Middle-earth after he landed on top of them. But I would argue this is more due to his power than his size. After all, we're also told that when Gandalf killed the balrog in Lord of the Rings, and cast its body off the peak of Zirakzigil, it broke the mountainside, but this doesn't make the balrog the size of a mountain. 

Anyway, regardless of the question of his size, Ancalagon's might is undeniable. For a moment it looked like he might be powerful enough to drive back the combined strength of the Valar, and Tolkien tells us that Ancalagon led the vanguard of *""the winged dragons, that had not before been seen; and so sudden and ruinous was the onset of that dreadful fleet that the host of the Valar was driven back, for the coming of the dragons was with great thunder, and lightning, and a tempest of fire.""* 

But, as with all others, even Ancalagon was eventually slain. And just like all others, his doom came at the hand of a single individual. *Eärendil the Mariner.* 

Now referring to Eärendil as a mortal Man is a little bit misleading, because technically he's the son of a mortal Man *and* an immortal Elf. In fact he is the only pure 50/50 man elf hybrid in the whole Legendarium (except for Galador and Gilmith who I mentioned in that video about the Half-Elves of Gondor). But for most of his life, Eärendil is counted amongst the race of Men, and just like Fram, Tuor, Bard, and the son of Húrin, he alone takes down Ancalagon, in what must have been one of the most epic battles in Middle-earth's history. 

So with Ancalgon dead, the race of dragons seemed to disappear from the world for a very long time. Throughout the entire Second Age there is absolutely no reference to any living dragon of any kind. But they were not all gone. And in the Third Age, dragons returned to once again plague the Free Peoples of the North. But many of *these* dragons were a bit different. 

So we're told by Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings that the seven Dwarven rings were ""*the foundation of each of the Seven Hoards of the Dwarf-kings of old"",* and it's highly likely that these treasure hoards were what attracted the dragons of the Grey Mountains in the first place. Gandalf tells us that *""the Dragons devoured them, and of the Seven Rings some were consumed in fire.""* 

And in the year 2570 of the Third Age, dragons returned from the *""wastes beyond""* and thus began the great *War of the Dwarves and Dragons.* However as I said, not all of these dragons were like the Urulóki of the First Age. Many of *these* dragons were Cold-drakes known as *Foalóki,* and Tolkien tells us that they ""*are cold as in the nature of snakes and serpents, and of them a many having wings go with the uttermost noise and speed.""* So these dragons can fly but they can’t breathe fire. 

However, the War of the Dwarves and Dragons is not a happy story. For twenty years the Dwarves fought the dragons, and in that time they held their ground in the Grey Mountains, but ultimately, this was not a war the Dwarves could win. Eventually King Dáin I and his son Frór were killed by a Cold-drake outside their very own doors, and this marked the end of the Dwarves' resistance in the Grey Mountains. King Dáin's eldest son and his heir, Thrór (that same Thrór who becomes the grandfather of Thorin Oakenshield) led many of the Dwarven survivors to Erebor, where they rebuilt the great Dwarven Kingdom under the Mountain. And for two hundred years, the Dwarves of Erebor prospered under King Thrór. However the dragons that killed Thrór's father were not gone forever, and in the year 2770 of the Third Age, Thrór would face a terror far greater than the one that killed his father and brother. 

Because of course, 2770 is the year that Smaug the Golden descended from the North *""like a hurricane""*, and sacked Erebor. He killed every guard who came out to challenge him, he destroyed the city of Dale, and for the following 171 years, Smaug slept on his newly acquired pile of gold. Now I reckon we all know the story of Smaug's eventual demise, and I'm not going to explain the entire plot of the Hobbit, but when Bard the Bowman fired that fateful arrow, not only did he kill Smaug, and rescue lake town, and avenge Dale, but he also ended a far greater conflict. He killed the last great dragon of the North, and he finally ended the threat that Morgoth had unleashed with Glaurung at the Battle of Sudden Flame, 6517 years earlier. 

However there is one last thing to say about Smaug. Because although he is the last great dragon of the Legendarium, one could also argue that he also is the last dragon of a far older literary tradition. You see, although I think it's fair to say that Tolkien popularised dragons in the genre of modern fantasy, he did not invent them. Dragons have been a staples of Slavic, Iberian, and Bretonic folklore, and perhaps the most famous tales of dragons and mortal Men (at least in Western European traditions) come from the writings of Tolkien's beloved ancestors, the Anglo-Saxons. 

So between 1920 and 1926, Tolkien jumped head first into the realm of old English literature by translating the epic tale of *Beowulf* into modern English. And of course at the end of the tale, the hero Beowulf (spoiler for a poem that's over 1000 years old) dies slaying a giant fire-breathing dragon. Furthermore in the tale of *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight*, which Tolkien translated in 1920 whilst working as his University's youngest professor, Sir Gawain battles fire-breathing wyrms. And of course, perhaps the most famous Anglo-Saxon tale to feature fire-breathing dragons is the Norse-Germanic *Völsunga Saga,* starring the fire-breathing monster Fafnir and the mortal Man Sigurd. (This is the same Sigurd/Siegfried that Chrsitoph Waltz talks about in Django Unchained, and one of the main characters in Wagner's '*The Ring Cycle'.*) 

Now there are a number of striking similarities between Fafnir and Smaug, as well as between Fafnir and Glaurung. In fact Bilbo's dialogue with Smaug almost perfectly mirrors Sigurd's exchange with Fafnir, and Glaurung's description as a flightless dragon who hoarded gold and breathes poison also mirrors Fafnir perfectly. 

So I guess this means that although dragons have been a part of Western imagination for over a thousand years, and although dragons have become one of the most recognisable elements of modern fantasy, it is Tolkien who tied these two strands together, and popularised dragons as we know them today. Not long ago, I was watching a movie with my nephew and he wanted to put on *How to Train Your Dragon.* And I was immediately struck by the fact that the humans (despite speaking with Sottish accents) all claim they are Vikings. Why is it that even in a 21st Century American children's movie  we associate dragons with old Norse mythology? It's because of Tolkien. It's because Tolkien created the first dragons of the modern era, by adapting the ancient dragons of Europe's historic past. Think about that next time you see a dragon on TV!

So thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on the dragons of Middle-earth, and Tolkien's wider contributions to the fantasy genre. As some of you may know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies.

1635769565.0,Dune was near perfect but I didn't connect emotionally to it - anyone else in the same boat?,"This isn't some hate piece. Whilst in the cinema I understood the film was objectively near perfect in achieving what it set out to do / the tone and mood it set out to evoke. It was stunning to watch and clearly there was a lot of love and respect for the source material.

But I didn't connect emotionally to any of it.

I think it might have been the music. I imagine the brief was 'make the music setup the tone and world building' which it nailed but there were no character motifs and no memorable and emotionally stimulating tracks of any sort (to my ears) such as you get in LOTR, Potter, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Marvel and even Game of Thrones. Even in Thrones when the music was dour, it was connected to a character - think the song about Tywin - or the Stark theme. The music in these IPs is iconic. You can hum them and they are often associated with a character and go on as much as a journey over the films as those characters. Dune had a lot of bombastic sound, but no feeling, at least to me.

Anyone else feel the same or am I just odd?

1700500310.0,I’m tired of Hard Magic Systems,"Hey y’all, I’m in the middle of my LOTR reread for the year and it’s put me back in touch with something I loved about fantasy from the beginning: soft, mysterious magic that doesn’t have an outright explanation/almost scientific break down; magic where some words are muttered and fire leaps from finger tips, where a staff can crack stone in half simply by touching it. I want some vagueness and mystery and high strangeness in my magic. So please, give me your best recommendation for series or stand-alones that have soft magic systems.


Really the only ones I’m familiar with as far as soft would be LOTR, Earthsea and Howl’s Moving Castle.

1605011580.0,"Hi r/Fantasy!!! I'm Evan Winter, author of THE RAGE OF DRAGONS and now THE FIRES OF VENGEANCE (which was released in stores & online just a few hours before I sat down to write this). I'm here on release day because this is exactly where I want to be. Please AMA!","For anyone interested in picking up THE FIRES OF VENGEANCE, you can do that here: [https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/evan-winter/the-fires-of-vengeance/9780316489805/](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/evan-winter/the-fires-of-vengeance/9780316489805/) (North America) or here [https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/titles/evan-winter/the-fires-of-vengeance/9780356512976/](https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/titles/evan-winter/the-fires-of-vengeance/9780356512976/) (UK and other markets), and for anyone interested in talking self-publishing, traditional publishing, writing, fantasy, or anything else, I'll try to set the scene:

\- I initially self-published THE RAGE OF DRAGONS, and because I'd lurked on the subreddit for years, I mentioned it on r/ Fantasy. My biggest hopes at the time were for the post to avoid being removed and for it to catch the attention of a few people who would try the book, besides my mom (here's the motion graphic cover I used: [https://youtu.be/jb3k5NrhMG8?t=20](https://youtu.be/jb3k5NrhMG8?t=20)).

\- Instead, the subreddit supported the book wholeheartedly and that support launched RAGE into the top 250 of all Amazon books that day.

\- That launch gave RAGE a ton of momentum, helping it to stay visible for longer than I would have been able to do on my own.

\- In a right place, right time moment that I'd be embarrassed to put in a movie script, my now editor, Brit Hvide (a brilliant writer), saw the r/ Fantasy post, took the time to read RAGE, figured out a way to get in touch with me, and offered to buy the series.

\- Once the deal was done, Orbit re-released RAGE (Summer 2019), and, given all that followed, it would be very hard for me to be happier with how things have gone.

\- It's been incredible to see the book in stores, libraries (I wrote most of RAGE in a library), and online; I've had the chance to do interviews with wonderful people and media outlets; I've met countless new and amazing people; and, most of all, it's been both humbling and exhilarating to see readers' reactions to the book itself.

\- And, because of you and all the other readers, I found out earlier this week that, more than a year after its Orbit release, THE RAGE OF DRAGONS is getting another hardcover print run.

\- Also because of you and all the other readers, RAGE was in a position to catch the attention of TIME magazine and the panel of judges it put together to develop their TOP 100 FANTASY BOOKS OF ALL TIME list.

So, in something of a summary, it's been an unbelievable ride, and at the moment, the only tangible thing I have to offer for such a life-changing couple of years are the 500 or so pages in THE FIRES OF VENGEANCE.

To anyone who gives those pages a try, I sincerely hope you find them worthy.",Fantasy

1564099851.0,"If you liked Avatar: The Last Airbender, please consider watching The Dragon Prince","If you liked A:TLA, the Dragon Prince has the same head writer. The show has two seasons out on Netflix already but it's definitely not as well known, which is hugely disappointing. Netflix hasn't been that big on the marketing front. The main premise deals with an ancient conflict between Humans and Elves which has been ongoing ever since Humans were kicked out of the magical land of Xadia for performing dark magic. However, as details of the conflict - recent and ancient - are slowly revealed, it turns out things are far more nuanced than they seem with both sides responsible for terrible actions. And though dark magic and its users have been consistently seen as evil, it's also not so black and white and has been used to save thousands of lives. 

If you liked the visuals in A:TLA, the visuals of the Dragon Prince are equally stunning with some really cool character designs. It also has a lot of pleasant diversity in characters along the POC and LGBT spectrums. Admittedly the animation is a little clunky in the first season but VASTLY improves in the second.

Here's the trailer for the first season:

1613010413.0,The Lies of Locke Lamora is absoloutely BRILLIANT. Thank you for recommending it to me.,"Locke Lamora has been recommended to me for so long and I finally got around to reading it. It was incredible, and as good if not better than what everyone on this subreddit made it out to be. Thank you Scott Lynch. It's moving right towards the top of my recommendations now. If you liked GRRM's characters, wit, prose, plot twists, and writing style, you'll probably also love this. For the uninitiated, I'd describe this as a cross between A Song of Ice and Fire and Ocean's 11, but only until the third act. 

I've been (fairly) chriticized in the past for praising books without giving specifics about why I liked it so much, so I'll try not to repeat that here. The following is everything I can remember enjoying (and that can be put in words), in no particular order.

First, the non-linear story telling, even intra-chapter, was fascinating, and set up some incredible twists and payoffs. One example is when we see >!Midnighters visit Don Salvara and reveal Locke's entire game, and then in the next portion of the chapter find out that that was really Locke.!< Truly made for a unique and refreshing read. 

Second, the characters. What's there not to like? The Spider, the Thorn, the gray king, Hell, even Don Salvara, they were all well flushed out characters with interesting back stories that played a role in the plot and explaining their motivations. Their intelligence and humor were of the kind that make me marvel that anyone can write them as well as Lynch does. 

Third, the fucking prose. Holy hell. The imagery and the descriptions, especially those delicious short interludes, which I typically find annoying. So, so pleasurable to read. So vivid, so beautiful. As is probably obvious, my own prose is lacking, as I can't even desribe adequately how amazing Lynch's prose was. Instead of trying to describe it, I'll just offer the following examples from Part 2 of the Prologue, on page 3, which don't include any spoilers:

""On the night the Lamora boy had come to live under the Thiefmaker's care, the old graveyard on Shades' Hill had been full of children,  standing at silent attention and waiting for their new brothers and sisters to be led down into the mausoleums.

""The Thiefmaker's wards all carried candles; their cold blue light shone through the silver curtains of river mist as streetlamps might glimmer through a smoke-grimed window. A chain of ghostlight wound its way down from the hilltop, through the stone markers and ceremonial paths, down to the wide glass bridge over the Coalsmoke Canal, half-visible in the blood-warm fog that seeps up from Camorr's wet bones on summer nights.""

Again, this is just one, early example. The book is stuffed with this kind of prose, and personally I find it so, so pleasurable to read.

Fourth, the plot twists and expectation subversions. Specifically, >!the early deaths of the Barsavis (especially Nazca) and Calo, Galdo, and Bug.!< Gave me real >!Red Wedding!< vibes, and were definitely heart-wrenching. Don't get me wrong, GRRM is still a different level, but this is the closest I've seen anyone come to it (in his style, at least).

Fifth, the humor. The book is chalk full of it, given the nature of Locke's profession, but one specific example that comes to mind is when Locke ran into >!Meraggio at Raven's Reach while wearing the clothes he stole off his very back.!< What's there not to love about that scene lmao.

Sixth, the world-building. Lynch manages to keep the story intimate and easy to follow while still building a complex, rich, and engaging world, especially through the use of his aforementioned beautiful interludes. I don't think I've ever been able to say this about a book before, but there wasn't a single instance of info-dumping (there was some of that in this book) that I didn't enjoy reading. 

Seventh, the pacing. Especially given the plot, you never go too long without some action, but to be honest even the scenes of the Gentlemen Bastards just having dinner are enjoyable to read, given their witty banter. 

Eigth, the payoffs. Call me basic, but >!I like seeing the good guys win.!< Watching >!the Falconer get tortured!< was very satisfying. And lmao love how >!Locke got the Salvaras and the Spider to dig through barges of shit looking for their money.!<

Of course, the book isn't without flaws. One thing that stuck out to me was how for a significant portion of the book following >!the murders of Calo, Galdo, and Bug,!< Locke just goes about business as usual. Lol we have a whole chapter dedicated to Locke >!stealing clothes!< just pages after this happens. Just seemed odd, but maybe that's consistent with Locke's character; I'll have to think about it.  

I cannot wait to jump into books 2 and 3, and hope the rest of the books (7 planned) don't take too long to come out. I understand most people think the series never reaches the heights of book 1 again, but I just can't wait to get some more of Locke and Jean and Lynch's prose and plots. 

PS: who the fuck is >!Sabetha.!< (Don't actually tell me, I don't want spoilers.",Fantasy
1710339086.0,I just read The Hobbit for the first time and I’m floored,"I thought I was diving into a fun story about going on an epic adventure to defeat the big bad dragon. And that’s exactly what I got for the first 80% of the book! Tolkien’s narration was so cozy, full of humour, and I felt like he was my grandpa telling me this awesome story. Bilbo's journey and transformation into an adventure leader was inspiring. What was there not to love? 

So imagine my confusion and disappointment to see Smaug was dealt with in four pages. One single arrow and done. Not to mention, the dwarves and Bilbo were nowhere in sight! Where was my epic battle? Where was everyone uniting and fighting against the terrible monster and coming out victorious? Worst of all, now we’re following this Bard guy we had never even heard of and they’re discussing “politics”. What the hell?

But I continued reading and my heart dropped when I understood where this was going. How gut wrenching it was to see the people we had been journeying with, the dwarves and specially Thorin, pretty much take the place of Smaug. Ready to enact violence because of his greed and turn on the people who had helped him (although everyone was a bit greedy, I’d say Bard had a pretty reasonable claim and approach to it). And then things keep escalating, more dwarves are coming and a war seems inevitable. I, who previously was disappointed by the lack of an epic battle, was now thinking “Please, let there be no battle”.

Even if at the nick of time they came together to fight against the goblins, it did nothing to lighten the heaviness in my stomach. The fact that they had all come so close to killing each other was depressing enough. Knowing that Tolkien lived through war made it hit all the harder. Things worked out fine in the end, but there was none of that huge victory, or “yay” feeling at defeating the enemy. As there shouldn’t be because wars aren’t like that, but I thought this was going to be more of a light hearted children’s story and didn’t think it’d hit this hard. I severely underestimated The Hobbit it seems.

Suffice it to say that The Hobbit will sit with me for a long long time, and I’m both looking forward to and terrified of reading LOTR now. ",Fantasy
1669046839.0,How do you feel when books make up fake swear words?,"I'm about halfway through Foundryside and absolutely loving it. But everyone says ""scrum"" or ""scrumming"" every other word and it makes me die a little bit inside every time haha. The author says what the etymology of the word is (extremely minor spoilers: >!sailor slang for anal sex!<), which is nice, but I would still much rather everyone just say fuck. The characters say other real swears like ""shit"" -- even irl religion based ones like ""hell"" and ""damn"" (""Holy hell, that's scrumming awful"" being the phrase that inspired this post lmao) -- so why come up with a replacement just for ""fuck""?? The book is full of sex and gore so it's not like it's trying to be appropriate for teenagers or anything.

I don't mind fake swears in YA, if the characters are supposed to be more high-class and prissy, or if the fake swears are used alongside real ones to denote class/culture/etc.. I'm actively in favor of replacing things like ""hell"" or ""damn"" if they don't make sense within the world's religion(s). But most of the time I think dancing around irl swear words just makes all the characters sound like little kids in a 50s TV show going ""oh golly gee"".",Fantasy

Speaking for me, I don't want to see all the CGI spren (Stormlight Archive) every 5 seconds next to live actors. Its too much, and expensive besides. 

Anime though. You can super stylize it and make it look incredible, like The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf on Netflix. That is both one of my favorite fantasy adaptations and one of my favorite anime movies all in one. It looks incredible, as good animes do, and it has the backing of great writing, as the fantasy novels that we love obviously do.

Imagine entering a warren in Malazan looking like a  Jujutsu Kaisen Domain Expansion. This would be everything for me. Then they studios throw a budget at the adaptors and marketing team to keep the episodes coming at a consistent pace, unlike many of my favorite animes. I think it could work.

1594496291.0,What Books r/fantasy Recommends (statistical analysis of 2000+ comments in June),"Last month there was a discussion of recommendations on r/fantasy and the daily recommendations thread. More people began using the daily thread (for a while at least) and I was intrigued by what the data might show. So I began recording things... and then the world caught on fire. Honestly I kind of regret undertaking this but I'm deep in the grip of the sunk cost fallacy now and this thread is my effort to justify all the time I put into this. Hopefully it's of interest to somebody!

# Methodology

I recorded two data sets: recommendations in the daily threads and recommendations to individual requests. For the daily thread I simply recorded every single one (coincidentally 775). Doing all the other threads would have wrecked my life so I tried to choose a neutral sampling method: if I selected a day I had to record EVERY recommendation thread for the entire day. My goal was to remove my own selection bias so that I wouldn't accidentally represent only one type of thread. (Or choose smaller threads that wouldn't kill my fingers. :P)

In the end I only managed to do five days (mix of weekdays and weekends) and that still came out to 1165 recommendations total. I think this is enough to be at least a somewhat representative sample. There are always exceptions and outliers but hopefully they somewhat balance out.

To avoid impacting the data myself I didn't participate in recommending things (except a few times 24+ hours later that I didn't record). Not participating also has a small impact but I don't think I'm a significant enough part of either sample for this to meaningfully skew the data.

I've tried to focus on objective data and averages that could be calculated automatically by spreadsheet. In some cases I had to do work by hand and I may have introduced minor errors. When I make statements that are based on my impressions but not statistically based I'll mention it.

# Grand Total

This post is going to focus on the books and authors that are recommended most frequently but to ignore all the others would be to dismiss all the other recommending that goes on here. So we'll begin with a big statistic:

~~In my sample~~ r/fantasy ~~recommended 1793 different books and 1831 different authors!~~

(The above numbers were determined by filtering the total book/author lists but commenters below pointed out problems with addition. That suggests that these totals were probably inflated by duplicates that weren't filtered. I still want to celebrate all the unique recommendations with the total unique fields below!)

It might seem illogical for the number of authors to be higher but there were many recommendations that suggested an author in general without listing a specific book. Since this tended to happen more often with less referenced authors (just my impression) this added up. This is also the reason my data below focuses more on authors than on specific books.

# Daily Thread Overview

Over the course of the month 214 users made 232 top level comments in the daily threads (on average 7.73/day). One surprise for me was just how many small questions there were: 46.6% of all base posts! I always thought of it as the recommendations thread but the ""small questions"" side is clearly important.

Of all the questions or requests 21 of them (9.5%) went unanswered after 48 hours. Some were pretty obscure questions but there were also some missed recommendation requests. Impression: these were very likely to be asked toward the end of the day so I strongly advise people to post or repost requests in the morning (USA time) when there's the most activity.

There were 11 times (4.7%) when someone used the thread to recommend something even though that's not in the thread description. There's nothing wrong with this but I suspect those people might get more reactions by promoting their favorites in a general thread.

I haven't parsed this data into types but there were 214 users starting comment chains and 171 users participating in them. There's some overlap and the second number misses some participants in general non-recommendation discussion.

Anyway that was just because I collected that data. From now on we'll consider only the 117 recommendation requests.

&#x200B;

# Daily Threads Top Authors

The following table is counting every recommendation of every author over the course of the month in the daily threads. Explicitly saying you second a recommendation wasn't counted. Asking ""Do I read X or Y?"" wasn't counted.

The average request received 3.27 responders giving 6.62 total recommendations. The average per person (2.02) is deceptive due to the occasional high volume comment: the mode was definitely 1 and I think the median is 1 as well. The most active request got 17 people giving 53 suggestions!

# ULTRA IMPORTANT STATISTICS

While doing all this I scanned the lists alphabetically to eliminate typos or name discrepancies. In the process I discovered the following critical facts:

* The most common male first name was Robert (13).
* The most common female first name was Sarah (10).
* The most common first word in a title was ""Blood"" or a derivative (8).

With this essential service rendered we may now carry on.

# Combined Top Authors

These two data sets are different but they are both part of r/fantasy so I think combining them is at least a little worthwhile. This list updates the totals of authors who ranked on one list but not on the other.

There were two authors exclusive to one set: Robert Jackson Bennett was recommended 14 times in the daily threads but never in the general threads. Robert Jordan had 11 in the general threads but none in the daily threads. Every other commonly mentioned author appeared at least once in the other set.

The above lists all include repeat recommendations in the same thread. Due to certain outlier threads where one book/author was an obvious choice and multiple people chimed in to suggest them this makes a difference. Below is a list of the NUMBER OF REQUESTS to which the author was suggested. So if an author was mentioned seven times in response to one question that only counts as one.

Mostly I've avoided analyzing user data because it feels a bit invasive. But many many users requested that I record the number of unique accounts for each author or measure what percentage of recommendations are the same people. I did this for all the top authors and that is my limit.

An author recommended only by a single user has a repeat percentage near 100% (but 100% is impossible because the first mention is never a repeat). If an author was mentioned by a new person each time they came up then it would be 0%. The formula is just (total - unique) / total.

# Most Common Books/Series

Though author data was generally more reliable, since I gathered all that data about specific titles I figure I should do something with it. Here are the most recommended individual books or series. This creates some new wrinkles: since I reduced every Discworld book to just ""Discworld"" in the dataset they come off as more monotonous than they really were. My gut feeling is that about half of them were specific book recommendations.

# Books/Series + More Data

I asked people what data they wanted to see and several upvoted comments asked me to put the top titles alongside other data. So I reproduced the top books/series list and added several other data points:

* Rank refers to how popular it was in the r/fantasy [""Top Novels"" poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/c7d7z8/the_rfantasy_2019_top_novels_poll_results/).
* Goodreads ratings is how many people left ratings on Goodreads (highest book for series). This can often be used as a rough proxy for how many readers a series has overall.
* Publication date is exactly what it sounds like (publication of the first book for series). This is interesting on its own and potentially relevant to interpreting ratings.

I didn't include the average Goodreads rating because while I think this can be interesting data it's not that useful as a point of comparison.

|BOOK/SERIES|RECCS|RANK|GR RATINGS|PUB DATE|

|Discworld|28|10|306,000|1983|
|Curse of Chalion|25|49|31,500|2001|

# Author Demographics

With such a huge number of authors it simply wasn't possible for me to determine this data for everyone so I'll first restrict my calculations to the top 25 authors. The numbers are as follows:

* 52% female, 48% male, 0% nonbinary/team
* 76% Americans, 12% British, 8% Canadians, 4% New Zealanders
* 96% white, 4% black (Octavia Butler)

People in the daily thread (especially oboist73!) helped me expand this list. I now give the same data for the top 84 authors (everyone who received 5 or more recommendations). It is possible that there are some authors lowish in both sets that should have scraped onto this list but this set still accounts for 834 reccs.

* 42 women, 41 men, 1 nonbinary
* 76 white, 5 Black, 3 Asian
* 66 Americans, 12 Brits, 4 Canadians, 1 New Zealander, 1 Singaporan
* It's hard to know orientation for sure but the vast majority seem to be straight. I could only confirm 3 who were otherwise: one pansexual/demisexual woman, one gay man, one bisexual woman.

I could render those as percentages but they're basically what you would expect from eyeballing the numbers. Calculating percentages of total recommendations also didn't generally move the numbers all that much.

ADDED BY POPULAR REQUEST

I made an effort to determine gender of all unique authors in the two sets because people requested it. Counting by hand is inherently limited and there could be some errors (especially with nonbinary folks). If someone is nonbinary with a gendered name (and isn't Sarah Gailey or someone I know) then they were miscounted. If someone was named James they got counted as male unless they were Jame Tiptree Jr. I did look up all initial authors, those from languages I didn't know, or ambiguous names.

Daily Threads:

* 186 men (52%)
* 159 women (45%)
* 3 NB (\~1%)
* 3 team (\~1%)
* 4 unknown (\~1%)

General Threads:

* 236 men (48%)
* 241 women (49%)
* 4 NB (\~1%)
* 4 team (\~1%)
* 6 unknown (\~1%)

I'm afraid I don't have it in me to balance all those by the number of votes since this has already taken a long time. The differences in the most recommended authors would have an influence here but I don't want to make assumptions about the authors down the list.

# My Soapbox

Now I'm going to get up on my soapbox and declare the following: I am super tired. I have tried my best to gather interesting data in a neutral fashion. I hope it's useful to someone.

I do think some of these results run contrary to conventional wisdom on this sub but I'm already worried enough about the reaction. If I've taken anything personally out of this it's that feeling guilty for recommending my favorites a couple times a month was silly.

I will do my best to update this post if people are interested in more data. If there's something that can be calculated automatically I'm happy to add it! If it requires some more manual counting... that's less likely. For example: if you're curious about a favorite author not listed it would be very easy to check them.",Fantasy

1638503656.0,When the whole is or is not greater than the sum of its parts. My thoughts after finishing both Malazan and Wheel of Time in the last few months.,"Let me preface this by saying this is not another ""Have you tried Malazan? You should try Malazan! ... Malazan!"" post. 

This is a spoiler-free discussion on my perception, while reading and after finishing, the series' Malazan Book of the Fallen (MBotF) by Steven Erikson and The Wheel of Time (WoT) by Robert Jordan (and Brandon Sanderson). This is not a book review or critique.

I read through MBotF and WoT over the last 2 years for the first time. I read them in rotation along with another random trilogy or series mixed in as I went. I don't like to read 2 books from the same series back to back because they tend to blur together in my mind. I want each book in a series to have its own isolated moment in my mind and have time to digest before I dive in to more from the same series.  Anyways, I started  Gardens of the Moon (MBotF 1)and followed it up with Eye of the World (Wot 1). 

I finished The Crippled God (MBotF 10) about 6 months ago, and just recently A Memory of Light (Wot 14). I first came across the concept of a ""series hangover"" while reading some discussion on MBotF. A series hangover (or whatever you want to call it) is a difficulty moving on after finishing a series. Some people have the urge to immediately restart the series or will have trouble starting another. I read multiple statements of people being so affected by the end of Malazan that they were unable to pick up another book for 3 months. I, however, didn't experience this when finishing the Malazan series. I simply took a day off as usual then picked up Crossroads of Twilight (WoT 10) and went right on.  Don't get me wrong, it was an outstanding series with an epic finale like you would expect from Erikson but it didn't leave me lost or feeling like something was missing. Fast forward to a week ago, I finished WoT and wanted nothing more than to pick Eye of the World back up and start over as well as rewatch every episode of the show over and over. 

So, if anyone has read my ramblings this far you're probably thinking ""ok, so? You liked WoT more than MBotF, it's not that big of a deal."" This is where my stupid title comes in (sorry I'm not that clever). Aristotle is credited with the term ""the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts."" If you were to lay down any MBotF book next to any WoT book (with probably the exception of A Memory of Light) and ask which book is better I would  point to the MBotF book every time. Despite that, right now looking back, I have to say **WoT is a better series than MBotF.  Despite the individual Malazan books being better than the individual WoT books.**

Each MBotF entry is an adventure all to itself. The characters are larger than life badasses, the battles are grand, and the climaxes are earth shaking. Each book is a smash hit, but multiple books start over with ne wcharacters and new locations. As opposed to being a 10 book series, it's almost 3 trilogies in the same world that masterfully mix together and converge in a grand finale. Conversely, WoT is a slow grind.  It's 14 books following a main character, their few friends and lovers, and a few ancillary characters and antagonists that help drive the plot.  Some of the middle books are so slow they are referred to as the slog. The great part is it all builds and builds and pays off epically in the end.  Every plot, subplot,  twist,  setback, and seemingly arbitrary conversation plays a role in the expert character growth and development that sets this series apart. By the end I felt like I had watched about 7 different people grow up and then change the world. 

I don't know if there is much of a point to this wall of text, but I've had these books on my mind the last few days. I just find it interesting that I loved each MBotF book so much, and while in the middle of the series' would've said without hesitation that it was the superior saga. Despite this, I look back and definitely feel a bigger connection and love for WoT, as a whole. 

I'm interested to see what others who have read both series think. Also interested in other really long series recommendations. Thanks r/fantasy for reading, have a good one.

1637773176.0,“It’s strange that people want violence but not sex in fantasy” — a response,"I often see this point floated around in discussions about sex in fiction and how people are hypocritical for sometimes wanting the most brutal violence on the page but not wanting even for a moment any sex between their characters. While I do think fantasy should have more sex, this is kind of an unfair argument to me that falsely equates these two things.

The thing about violence in fantasy is that it is a staple. People often pick up fantasy to read about magic fights or dragon battles or whatnot. I know going into a Brandon Sanderson book that I’m probably gonna get a cool magic system that is exploited to kill people. Similarly if you pick up something grimdark you are probably gonna get some more brutal violence, and you will probably EXPECT that. 

While I primarily read for character dynamics and I’m sure few read exclusively for violence, the fact remains that part of why many of us read fantasy is for this kinda thing. I want to see how a 14 year old girl uses bread magic to beat up bad guys. I want to see how those who wear bioenergetic Jade beat the shit out of those who don’t. End of the day, this is a genre expectation of fantasy. Not all fantasy has violence, true, and I do enjoy reading those (Piranesi is amazing) but end of the day this is a fair genre expectation, whereas sex is not something we typically expect in fantasy.

As a result it’s a little strange to me that we are critical of people wanting violence but not sex in fantasy. We pick up fantasy often for experiences that we cannot have ourselves, but most people (who are not asexual) will have sex, most people will not get a chance to slaughter ten enemies on a tower top with a sword, or ride a dragon into battle and burn down an army. The fact that authors don’t put sex in their fantasy works often to me has nothing to do with shying away from intimacy (although this might be true in certain cases) but more to do with wanting to strengthen the fantasy the book is trying to create for the reader. 

It’s like how on the flip side, a contemporary romance author might not include brutal gratuitous violence in their book, because they are concerned more with different things from fantasy authors. Romance books are almost a different kind of fantasy from fantasy books, so an increased focus on sex and intimacy in those supporting the romance fantasy is analogous to mute fantasy fantasy of violent magical battles.

So, I don’t know, I want more sex in fantasy books personally but I don’t think that it is on the same level of violence in fantasy at all, and I wanted to point out why this argument bothers me.",Fantasy

The wrap comes a full year behind schedule, with shooting of the series repeatedly disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.

Amazon have not officially confirmed the news as yet, but multiple crew members have marked the completion of shooting with social media posts.

They can't rest easy for too long, however, as production is rolling straight into Season 2. The cast and crew are still in Prague (with Lan [reportedly stealing](https://www.instagram.com/p/COLXAGuHfgo/) Moiraine's Golden Globe Award a few days back), and casting and pre-production on the second year is already in full swing. Whether actual shooting will continue immediately into the second season or there'll be a short break is unclear.

Shooting for the bulk of the first season was completed back in November 2020, with just a few last scenes being needed to complete the season. VFX, music scoring and post-production have continued through the pandemic, meaning that it hopefully will not take long to integrate the newly-completed scenes into the finished episodes.

1623233679.0,Brandon Sanderson: A Competent Man,"I know that this sub is inundated with discussions of Sanderson, more so than any other big ticket author, so bear with me on this, because I hope it's slightly different to the usual merry-go-round of whether he is over/underrated, which spirals off into endless sub-beefs and then a meta post about how we should all shut up about Brandon Sanderson and stickied mod comment reminding everyone to play nice^(4). If you finish this and still think I should shut up about Brandon Sanderson, well, I won't hold it against you.

What I want to argue is not whether Sanderson is a good or a bad author, but that he is an astoundingly competent one who is exactly as good as he needs to be, and no more.

**Damned With Faint Praise**

If this sounds like a criticism, I suppose it is. I don't think he is a great prose stylist, but neither do I think he's a bad one. I don't think his characters are searing originals, but I don't think they're stereotypes either. I don't think there are many things that he does badly, and some things he does very well. What I think makes him remarkable as a fantasy author, more so than any other I can think of (possibly in history), is his consistency^(2).

In between 2005 and 2020, Sanderson published twelve full length novels. These were not short novels. Oathbringer, the longest to date, tops out at 454,768 words. If Brandon Sanderson's collected works fell on you from a shelf, you would be feeling it for a while. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/brandonsanderson/comments/cncrea/word_count_of_brandon_sandersons_books/) post puts his overall tally in this period at around 5 million words. That is a lot of words.

Here's the remarkable thing about this chunk of books that he's turned out in about 15 years: *there isn't a single bad one*^(1). There are some small fluctuations. I like some more than others. Some are weaker than others. But it increasingly seems like he is incapable of writing anything which dips below a particular standard. He is the king of 7/10, and it has made him famous.

**Writing A Book Is Hard**

I'll let you take a moment to recover from that bombshell.

Writing a book is hard. Being good at writing is only the start. The world is full of people who can write beautifully, whose characters are vivid and real, whose worlds are constructed with depth and sensitivity. They work in libraries and factories and coffee shops. You might be one of these people. They aren't published, because writing a book is hard. Writing a book is hard because a book is more than the sum of its prose and its characters and its setting. It is the pulling together of hundreds of disparate threads into a coherent whole. It is a story which has to be fast when it needs to be fast, and slow when it needs to be slow. Characters must change and grow at the right times. It must be thematically and tonally consistent. It must grip. This is why finishing a book is only half the battle, because then it's time to hack it into a good *story.* Sharpen your cutting scissors.

Writing a book is hard.

Writing a book is hard unless you're Brandon Sanderson.

I think a good way to think about these features is the micro vs the macro. The micro is the zoomed in storytelling. The description, the dialogue, the action. These aren't easy or trivial things to get right. They are the foundation of the story. If you can't write, you can't write. These are the things that Brandon Sanderson is adequate at. Maybe even good! But they aren't the reason he is successful, and they aren't the reason he is special.

Brandon Sanderson is the master of the macro. The top down view. The man seems to understand the construction of a series and a story and a world like no-one else^(3). This is why I think his worldbuilding is one area of writing where he really does stand out, because he has such a finely attuned sense of the big picture. He is systematic. He *teaches* how to construct magic systems. We all know his rules of magic. They're good because they work.

**Do Androids Dream Of Electric Axehounds?**

He feels to me sometimes like a machine designed by publishers. Plug him in and let him turn out an endless stream of solid, popular books, all of which relate to a huge, ambitious overarching plot. Which other author can have written this many Cosmere books and say they are only a third of the way through their grand plan? Who could believe they could finish such an undertaking? People write more slowly, or they get bogged down in the weeds when the plot gets too big, or the world cannot take the strain placed on it. Rothfuss books come round about as often as Halley's Comet. GRRM is never going to finish Game of Thrones. Brandon Sanderson is going to die having written enough books to build an Iron Throne from them. And the reason for that is because he is achingly competent. He understands story in the way that a script editor or a showrunner understands story, as a set of pieces to arrange in the right order for the maximum effect. The pieces themselves might be unremarkable - these are the micro features - but what's the point of having beautiful puzzle pieces if you never put together the puzzle?

I don't mean to put him down (though I'm sure someone will say I am). I think what he does is remarkable and maybe unprecedented. There is a degree to which he is alive at the right time to ride the wave of popular fantasy. But I really think it is an extraordinary feat to continue to write at the pace and precision that he does. He is building an empire.

Now I can't claim to have any insight into his head. I'm not sure if he would be offended by this characterisation or not. But I think it's a useful way to think about him and his virtues. Because the thing is, it's only his ability to write so quickly and consistently which is allowing him such ambition. There is no danger of scope creep with Sanderson. His scope has always been so wide that he can see the curvature of the earth. His universe travelling characters have been there from the start. His plans to synthesise multiple magic systems. What he is doing would not be possible for any other author, I don't think.

Sometimes I wonder whether you can sense a little urgency in his writing because he wants to finish it, this grand edifice. Fifteen, twenty million words. Multiple sequences. A whole universe, a total theory of magic and matter. Maybe even he senses how absurd a task it is, and knows he can't ever slow down.

Is Brandon Sanderson a good writer or a bad one? My answer is that you're asking the wrong kind of question. Brandon Sanderson is a cyborg, and he's coming for you.

Okay, I think that's long enough! Have a nice day and keep it cool in the comments.

^(2) *Okay I shouldn't have used the word 'unprecedented' here, let's just say it's highly unusual, though I think other writers who have written as prolifically haven't done so as successfully and as consistently, and I think there's a reason for that.*

1611943441.0,What Colour is Legolas' Hair?,"Close your eyes and picture the character of Legolas. Not Orlando Bloom. Legolas. Now, without overthinking your choice, answer this question. What colour is Legolas’s hair? The good news is that whatever answer your mind’s eye conjured, you’re right. There are no wrong answers here (well except maybe pink). You see despite the fact that Legolas is far from an insignificant character *The Lord of the Rings*, JRR Tolkien kept almost everything about him a mystery. We don’t know how old he is, or who his mother was, or even what colour his hair is. And so all we can do is speculate and draw our own conclusions. However this seemingly trivial question about a supporting character’s hair colour, in fact opens up a much wider question about the nature of the Woodland Elves, their mysterious history in Middle-earth, and even the characteristics of their political and cultural identities. Well, at least to an extent.  

So I feel that most people when imagining Legolas’s hair colour, will fall into one of two camps: gold and dark. Now if you imagined something else like silver or brown, that’s all good too, like I said there are no wrong answers, but when it comes to what Tolkien actually wrote, there really are only two points of reference. One for dark. And one for gold. So when Legolas is first introduced in *The Fellowship of the Ring* we’re told nothing more than that he was *“a strange Elf clad in green and brown.”* However a few chapters later Tolkien does tells us “*his head was dark.”* Now on the one hand this may seem fairly cut and dry. Legolas has dark hair, what more is there to say? But it should be noted that within the context of this scene, Legolas is being described at night, and so the jury’s still out on whether the darkness refers to the pigment of his hair, or simply the night-time’s shadows. Now the only other reference that the Professor gave us on this topic, can be found in *The Hobbit*, where the Elvenking of Mirkwood is described as wearing *“a crown of leaves upon his golden hair”.* Now eighteen years later, this Elvenking was of course revealed to be Thranduil, the father of Legolas, so it stands to reason that Legolas may have inherited his father’s hair colour, and thus his hair is golden. But again, this should be taken with a pinch of salt. Because (despite what the movies tell us) Legolas does not appear in the Hobbit, and when Tolkien wrote it in the 1930s, neither Legolas nor the Fellowship existed in his mind. So like I said, there are no wrong answers. 

And at the end of the day, this debate really isn’t a big deal either way. I guess we’re all free to imagine Legolas’s hair in whatever way we choose. But, I do think there’s more to this question than simple aesthetics. Because ultimately, what we’re really debating here isn’t what a supporting character looks like, but the nature of the Wood-elves themselves. 

So when we talk about Wood-elves in Middle-earth, we’re not really talking about one independent clan of elves. Instead we’re talking about two. You see the Woodland realm of Mirkwood (formerly known as the Greenwood) is populated entirely by Dark Elves, but not all Dark Elves are the same. On the one hand there are the *Silvan Elves,* who are reclusive, forest-dwelling folk that pretty neatly fit into our preconceived ideas of what a Wood-elf might look like. But on the other hand, there are the *Sindar Elves,* and they’re a bit different. (By the way, unlike in a lot of other fantasy worlds, in Tolkien's works the term Dark Elf has nothing to do with evil elves. It simply refers to the elves who have *not* been ennobled by the light of the West. 

So way back in the First Age, the only elves in the Woodland Realm were the native *Silvan.* And these guys lived simple and scattered lives amongst the trees. Now, although Tolkien is famous for creating a ton of new languages, the word Silvan was not actually invented him. Instead Silvan, or Sylvan, first entered our language through the Roman god Silvānus, who happened to be the god of woodland, forests, and uncultivated wilderness. So although Silvan is the word that Tolkien most commonly used to describe these woodland elves, their actual name in the Elvish language is *Tawarwaith,* which means wood people. And the Silvan were given this name by their cultural cousins, the *Sindar*.  

Now the Sindar were not originally inhabitants of the Greenwood. Back in the First Age they were known as the Grey Elves of Beleriand, and they fought alongside the Noldor from the West, in the wars against Morgoth. But to be honest, the Sindar and the Noldor had a rather rocky relationship, and once Morgoth was defeated and the Second Age began, their common enemy was no more. However unfortunately for the surviving Sindar, both their kingdom and their king were also gone, and they mostly lived as refugees in the new kingdom of the Noldor. And understandably, they were somewhat reluctant to recognise the Noldor’s king as *their* new monarch. So, a pair of Sindar princes called Amdir and Oropher decided to journey east, and to build two new Sindar kingdoms of their own. 

After crossing the Misty Mountains, Amdir journeyed south and he came to the lands of Lothlórien. There he established a new kingdom, and he became the Sindar king of a predominantly Silvan population. Oropher on the other hand went north, and there he founded his own kingdom in the Greenwood. And just like with Amdir in Lothlórien, Oropher became the new king of the princeless Silvan. Now this means that in both of the woodland realms, we have a large population of “*less wise but more dangerous”* Silvan elves, being governed by a smaller but much more elite ruling class of Sindar elves. 

And this Sindar/Silvan distinction brings us all the way back to our original question. What colour is Legolas’s hair? 

You see Oropher’s great claim to fame, apart from being the fool who got two thirds of his army killed in the War of the Last Alliance, is that he is the grandfather of Legolas. Which means that despite Legolas’s appearance being very much in keeping with that of a Wood-elf’s, *“a strange Elf clad in green and brown”,* we know that Legolas has at least some Sindar heritage. What we don’t know is how much.

And this is because Tolkien tells us absolutely nothing about the women in Legolas’s family. We know that his grandfather was a prince of the Sindar, but who was his grandmother? Who was his mother? To answer this question there’s nowhere we go but deep down the rabbit hole of educated speculation. 

So the identity of Oropher’s wife is completely unknown to us. And the identity of Thranduil’s wife is also completely unknown. *And* the identity of Amdir’s wife is completely unknown to us. But what we do know, is that Amdir’s son Amroth fell in love with an Elf-maiden called Nimrodel. And unlike Oropher, Amdir, and Amroth, Nimrodel was not one of the Sindar elites. Instead she was a native Silvan. Now it’s a bit of a stretch to presume that Sindar princes intermarrying with Silvan women was the norm just because there’s one example of it, but to be fair it is the only example that we have. And furthermore, in the *Unfinished Tales* Tolkien tells us *“Oropher had come* \[to the Greenwood\] *with only a handful of Sindar, and they were soon merged with the Silvan Elves, adopting their language and taking names of Silvan form* *and style…They wished indeed to become Silvan folk and to return, as they said, to the simple life.”* 

Now I do need to point out that when Oropher first came to the Greenwood, his son Thranduil had already been born, which makes it clear that Thranduil's mother was not a Silvan of the Greenwood. But she may very well have been one of the Laiquendi, the Green-elves of Beleriand, who are cultural descendants of the Silvan that just happened to journey west. Anyway after a disastrous battle during the First Age, the Laiquendi came to dwell in the same kingdom as Oropher's Sindar people, so perhaps Thranduil's mother was one of them. Or not, we just don't know.  But the idea of Oropher marrying a woman of the Laiquendi is further supported by Tolkien’s description of Thranduil’s hair. 

Okay, so before I go too deep into this whole hair colour issue, I should point out that this is not an exact science. Both the Sindar and the Silvan were originally descended from the clan known as the Teleri, so it’s not impossible that a Sinda and Silvan could both share the same hair colour. However, throughout the Legendarium we’re introduced to loads of Sindar Elves and almost all the ones who get a description have either dark or silver hair. Not one of them (with the possible exception of Thranduil) is ever described as blonde. Now, on the other hand there is only one Silvan character in the entire Legendarium whose hair colour is explicitly given, and he is an unnamed friend of Haldir’s who we meet in Lothlórien. And Tolkien tells us this guy’s hair *”glinted like gold in the sun”.* Furthermore there is an implication that Amroth’s Silvan lover Nimrodel also had golden hair, as it’s compared to sunlight *“upon the golden boughs”.* But this is admittedly a little more open to interpretation, so I guess we can put Nimrodel in the maybe pile. 

Anyway from our admittedly limited samples we may presume that black, grey, and silver are the colours of Sindar hair, and some type of golden (whether that be blonde or ginger I’ll let you decide) is the colour of Silvan hair. And if this is the case, then I’d speculate that Thranduil’s golden hair suggests that he may be the product of interbreeding between a Sindar father and a Laiquendi mother. 

And the aforementioned Unfinished Tales passage does pretty much state that when Oropher and his people arrived in the Woodland Realm, many of his Sindar 'went native', and before long they assimilated themselves into the pre-existing Silvan society of the Greenwood. In fact Tolkien tells us “*they did this deliberately”.* 

So if we accept that Legolas’s grandmother may indeed have been descended from one of the Silvan Elves of the Greenwood, then this would make Legolas at least 25% Silvan and at most 75% Silvan. Now we would be able to narrow this down a bit more if we knew *anything* about his mother, but alas we do not. And this is why the question of Legolas’s hair colour is so interesting. Close your eyes and picture him again. If you’re imagining a character with dark or silvery grey hair, then the implication is that Thranduil took a wife with at least some significant degree of Sindar heritage. And this would suggest that even two generations after Oropher, there is still some sort of divide between the elite Sindar rulers, and their majority Silvan populace.  However, if you’re imagining Legolas with golden, blonde or ginger hair, then this implies that the Sindar truly did go native, and the Woodland rulers are now indistinguishable from the people they rule. Perhaps, just as Oropher intended, the Sindar and the Silvan merged into something new. Perhaps the Sindar made the Silvan a bit more wise, and the Silvan made the Sindar a bit more dangerous? 

Whenever we talk about Elves in Middle-earth, the conversation tends to revolve around the Elves of the West and their descendants.  And this is probably fair enough, as the Noldor are truly fascinating characters, and they do seem to love creating drama. But while discussing the big name characters like Galadriel, and Elrond, and Glorfindel, we mustn’t forget the Elves of the East. The woodland folk who Tolkien told us so little about. They did not build great cities, nor were they masters of lore, but they do demonstrate the virtues of a simpler life, in tune with nature. They are mysterious and secretive, but ancient and fair. And because Tolkien’s Legendarium is somehow both amazingly detailed in its scope, but also strangely reserved in regards to character descriptions, we’re able to use our mind’s eye to create our own conclusions about the simpler, humbler, and more dangerous variety of woodland Elves.  

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on Legolas and how you imagine him. As some of you may know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

Thanks again everyone. Much love and stay groovy ❤️",Fantasy
1649649884.0,So it seems Amazon has changed their 1-5 star system so only written reviews are showing on author's pages currently. Just rating a book doesn't seem to do anything anymore. This is causing authors to lose 99% of their ratings and makes new releases look like they are failing.,"Starting on April 5th, authors have reported that their ratings have dropped almost 99%. Many of us have gone from getting 20-50 ratings/reviews a day to 1-2 a day max. Sales have stayed consistent so the only change is in the ratings, with such a steep dropoff it has to be something internal with Amazon.

In discussions within various author groups, we've realized what is happening is that the ratings (where you just click the amount of stars to give without leaving a written review) are no longer doing anything. We don't know if the ratings just aren't showing up on Amazon, or if nobody is being asked to give ratings anymore, or what is happening.

All we know is that authors are seeing a 99% drop in ratings/reviews and it is making authors who just released a new book look like their book is absolutely tanking compared to every other book out there. Books that should have 100s of ratings after big opening weeks have 3 or 4 reviews total.

I just wanted to try to bring this to more people's attention. If you see a book that just launched that only has a few reviews, don't be afraid to give it a chance.

And if you finish a book you really liked, **please** leave a written review for now to help the author as much as possible.

Edit: As of this morning - after five days without any ratings showing - reports are coming in that they are BACK! Either Amazon fixed whatever was wrong or maybe enough people started talking about the issue that someone noticed the problem, but either way thank you all for bringing visibility to this issue!!",Fantasy

1576557940.0,My experience on having my debut edited by the Big Five,"My debut space opera noir novel, Stormblood got picked up last year by Gollancz as the first of a trilogy. And, like any other Trad published book, it goes through the rounds of editing. I'd already edited the book thoroughly, with myself, beta readers, my agent. When it ended up in the hands of my editor Gillian Redfearn (who also edits Brandon Sanderson, Joe Abercrombie and Patrick Rothfuss in the UK) I thought there wouldn't be too much more work to do.

I was very, very wrong.

There's a lot in this industry that isn't always transparent but should be. Many of you may be interested in working with a Big Five editor yourselves one day, so I wanted to provide some insight into the guts and gears of the editing process, the various hoops and cycles a book goes through, and what my personal experience has been in crunching the revisions. 

I believe it’s very underestimated how extensive the editing process is when it comes to traditional publishing. We’re not talking about cleaning up typos, chopping away gratuitous sentences and chapters , or even tweaking character arcs. No, we’re talking about digging down into the root canals of the narrative, the bones of what gives a book its identity. Fleshing out the ambiance, the structure, the voice, the style, and using this understanding in context to influence how you approach edits.

It sounds like a mouthful, but it’s necessary to see your work from a different light. And it’s necessary to take that mental stance when editing. It’s so easy to get caught up in the minute, in one chapter, that you don’t take the necessary steps back and look at the book as a whole. That scene has great dialogue, but is it disrupting the pacing? That’s an interesting turn of events, but could it be entirely rewritten to be better? The tricky thing is, it’s not about what’s objectively better. It’s about whether it’s better for your book, your style, your voice. If I wanted to have my book have breakneck pacing from cover to cover, we’d be taking a completely different approach.

So that’s what we did for the first round of edits. In taking a step back and looking at the naked scaffolding of the structure, we realised there needed to be some changes early in the book, in terms of character motivation, relationships and backstory. Which changes the way the entire book, and the main character, comes across. Not in a major way, but significantly enough. And that’s where playing word jenga comes in: because the wrong sentence in the wrong place can get your entire book to come crashing down around your head.

After we agreed to make the change, my editor worked on the first half of the book to reflect this. This meant tweaking characters, shuffling certain flashback scenes. At this point, I don’t touch anything on a sentence-level, any of the prose. This is all big-picture stuff.

I applied the changes, and sent it back to my editor. My editor then re-edited the first-half of the book again, because she’s a pro, and edited the second half in as a consequence of the changes we made in the first half. Because, if she didn’t, we’d be seeing two very different stories.
This is what I meant at the start, about looking at the bare bones of your book.

So I edited the second half again. Tightening characters, adding and removing world-building, checking for continuity, and in some cases, completely re-writing scenes, or the internal mechanics of a scene. This means I change what the characters go about doing in order to complete their goals, whether they accomplish them, what the consequences are. Big-picture stuff that ripples out. As an example, one battle sequence was very run and gun. We retooled it to be about tactics and team co-operation. Another scene had a character try to get information from someone, blowing his cover pretty soon and searching the guy’s place. Instead, I had him remain undercover almost the entire time, slowly up the dread and tension the two characters play verbal cat and mouse, until one breaks.

It’s a hell of a headache, and it’s not easy to take scenes that have written a certain way, been in place, for years, and strip them out and completely retool them, but it’s necessary. And it almost always means a better book.

Then comes my next pass. I make most use of my editor’s comments in this round. Plugging logic gaps, tightening sentences, adding or deleting sentences, making sure all the dialogue is consistent with the characters, chopping away the ugly word clay, fixing up the location of the scene (and moving it, if need be) making adjustments that impact the scene, but nothing else. This is where the book is more or less falling into place. It’s probably the part I enjoy the most, putting the meat on the bone so the plot, story, characters and descriptions read smoothly and consistently.

The next round is where I am now. Fixing up sentence-level structure, word-choice, prose, and descriptions. My editor’s mighty red pen has left it’s mark on every single page, so there’s no getting away from it. It’s tempting to call it purely cosmetics, but my work is first-person, very voice-driven, and the state of the main character absolutely impacts the prose. I don’t care too much about flowery word-choice or elegant descriptions, but I absolutely care about each word sounding like it could come from the protagonist’s mouth. So I make sure my sentences are running smoothly, so a heedlessly complicated word or turn of phrase doesn’t turn into a jolting speed-bump. I ensure the sentences and paragraphs have a nice rhythm and balance to them. I deliberately purge any “flowery” prose, any words that detract from the tone I’m trying to strike, any poorly-timed metaphors. So words like “illuminate” and “sparkle” or any of their relations are chopped out. I’m trying to write sharp, razor-edged prose with a good dose of sarcasm and cynicism when needed. So specific word-choice, and how the words are conveyed, matter. I’m still going through it, and will probably be doing so for the first half of December, if not a little more.

And then, of course, when all’s said and done, there’s copy edits.
So there’s a lot of hours and a lot of work poured into editing a book, both by the editor and author. But here’s the thing about print: it lasts forever. So if a sentence, paragraph, chapter, or even character, is lacking, it’ll be lacking forever. And it’s my debut, and you know what they say about getting one chance to make a first impression. . .

Either way, I hope this was insightful or helpful to you all.

ETA: Wow! Gold! Never that had happen before. Thank you kindly, stranger. It's most appreciated. 
I've had a few people message me asking about buying the book, so I'll say that pre-orders are disproportionately helpful to debut authors. They tell the publishers, booksellers, marketers, etc, that there's an audience and numbers to back it up. It's already up on Amazon and Audible for all regional retailers (except US), so I'm linking to Book Depository. It's free shipping worldwide. The book comes out in June, and if you're able to pre-order, it would help immensely.

**A Comprehensive List of Authors I've Read**

* Brian Sanderson - I'm amazed how he single-handedly revolutionized the genre. It's a shame no other author has his work ethic.
* JRR Tolkien - Obviously. The man invented fantasy. You can't call yourself a fantasy fan if you haven't read him.
* Erik Stevenson - I know Malazan is almost a meme at this point, but have you tried it?
* Jim Butcher - This whole ""urban fantasy"" thing is radical and awesome. Why doesn't anyone else try to write in this genre?
* Robert Jordan - Amazing. If you don't like his writing at first, keep reading! Book 12 is where things really pick up.
* Robin Hobb - Love him!

**What I'm Looking For**

* Realism. Some people seem to think that women and people of color existed in Medieval Europe, and I'm honor-bound to correct them. 
* It has to be bloody! I've read--well, actually just vaguely heard about--lots of books where no one is killed by the third page. It's not only boring, it's unrealistic (see above).
* Epic! I know, I know, that covers literally all of fantasy. But some people not as well-read as myself don't understand this.
* Ideally something that I've already heard of.
* Something objectively great. I'm not interested in books you personally like, just what the free market has determined to be best.

**What I'm** ***NOT*** **Looking For**

* I'd rather avoid romance, unless it's of a similar quality to Brian Sanderson's work.
* It must be mature. None of the young adult garbage. I'm not a young person.
* No Mary Sues, please. I like my characters struggling to face their challenges and failing a lot before they succeed. For a good example of this, think of Kvothe from The Kingkiller Chronicles.
* I won't read unfinished series. Sorry, but I prefer to have the entire story available before I begin. That means I usually have large book hauls when I go to the store, but what can I say? I like to support authors.
* Please don't try to shove diversity down my throat. Like with the recent Hugo finalist announcement. Had you ever even heard of any of those books? I hadn't, so they can't possibly be good.

If my requirements seem intimidating, don't worry! Before I became a veteran fantasy reader, I was in your shoes once. Although that was months ago, I can still remember it like it was yesterday. 

Anyway, I've already read all the truly good fantasy books. Now I'm just looking for the next-best thing.",Fantasy

As we’re all in different time zones, we will be answering questions throughout the day (with, in my case, breaks to wrangle kids and/or hyperventilate over my brief digital proximity to this list of writers). Ask us anything!!!

Here’s a bit more about the *Into Shadow* collection: 

Some truths are carefully concealed; others merely forgotten. In this spellbinding collection, seven acclaimed fantasy authors create characters who venture into the depths where others fear to tread. But when forbidden knowledge is the ultimate power, how far can they go before the darkness consumes them?

* *The Six Deaths of the Saint* by Alix E. Harrow: The Saint of War spares the life of a servant girl so she can fulfill her destiny as the kingdom’s greatest warrior in this short story of love and loyalty. Always mindful of the debt she owes, the girl finds her worth as a weapon in the hand of the Prince. Her victories make him a king, then an emperor. The bards sing her name and her enemies fear it. But the war never ends and the cost keeps rising—how many times will she repeat her own story?
* *Out of the Mirror, Darkness* by Garth Nix: A cynical “fixer” for a silent-film studio must confront the shadows behind the bright lights in this noir-tinged short story. It’s business as usual on the set of another cheap sword-and-sandal production by Pharos Pictures—until the lead actress suddenly falls into a deep, mysterious sleep. Jordan Harper can talk down high-strung starlets and knock sense into stuntmen, but this…this is the kind of uncanny problem that he’d usually bring to Mrs. Hope. Unfortunately, the preternaturally capable secretary is on a business trip with the studio head. Harper must get to the bottom of the mystery on his own before another cast member succumbs—or worse, they blow the budget.
* *Persephone* by Lev Grossman: A teenage nobody crosses a line that will change her life forever in this short coming-of-age story. Ever since her dad disappeared five years ago, Persephone has quietly walled off the feelings she’d rather not feel. There’s no room for pain or anger when you’re just trying to get through the hell that is high school. But one day, the crush of taunts and disappointments is finally too much—and a power breaks loose inside her that she never knew was there. 
* *What the Dead Know* by Nghi Vo: A woman posing as a medium who can channel the spirit world comes face to face with the truth in this short historical fantasy. The Fogg River Seminary, a girls’ school in a small Illinois town, is supposed to be just another stop on Maryse and Vasyl’s endless travels. They’ve made lucrative use of Maryse’s “foreign” looks in their melodramatic séance act—and an act is all it is. Then, during their performance, a blizzard sweeps in and cuts them off from town completely. In the freezing halls, there’s a voice speaking the secrets of the dead, and Maryse has no choice but to listen…because this time, the voice is real.
* *Undercover* by Tamsyn Muir: When a stranger comes to town, secrets are sure to come out. A fresh-faced newcomer arrives in an isolated, gang-run town and soon finds herself taking a job nobody else wants: bodyguard to a ghoul. Not just your average mindless, half-rotted shuffler, though. Lucille is a dancer who can still put on her own lipstick and whose shows are half burlesque, half gladiator match. But the stranger is no stranger to this particular ghoul. Both women are undercover in their own way. And both have something to lose if their connection comes to light.
* *The Candles Are Burning* by Veronica G. Henry: Amid the modern trappings of 1950s Savannah, an ancient evil threatens a young widow and her daughter in this chilling short story. When her husband dies unexpectedly, Maggie Royal is struck with sinister visions that foretell danger for her and for her five-year-old daughter. Her mother and grandmother were said to have “the sight,” but it was never like this. With no one alive to turn to, Maggie must move quickly to uncover the meaning of her visions before her candle is snuffed out.
* *The Garden* by Tomi Champion-Adeyemi: In this dreamlike short story told in alternating prose and verse, Champion-Adeyemi weaves a tale of a young woman’s journey to find her mother and uncover her secrets. Fifteen years ago, Lęina’s mother, Yuliana, went searching for a mythical place called the Garden and never returned. Determined to learn the truth about what happened, Lęina travels to Brazil to search for the hidden realm, with Yuliana’s journal and a local tour guide leading the way. But Lęina soon begins to wonder if she’s looking for answers—or if what she truly wants to find is herself.",Fantasy

1634035530.0,Happy 42nd Birthday to The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel),"Douglas Adams's novel, *The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, turns 42 today.

Published on 12 October 1979, the novel was based on Adams's radio series of the same name which had aired eighteen months earlier on the BBC. With the radio series a huge success, Adams was convinced to turn the series into a book. Adams only adapted the first four parts of the radio series into the book, saving the rest for the sequel, *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* (published a year later), although, as was his wont, Adams made major plot and character changes between the different versions of the story. The same held true of the excellent BBC mini-series (which aired in 1981), the video game (1984) and feature film (2005), which all feature significant differences and twists to the same basic premise.

The novel sold extremely well, shifting 250,000 copies in its first three months on sale. Unusually for a British comedic SF novel, the book was a hit in the United States as well and sales of the novel passed a million in 1984, with Adams becoming a minor celebrity for his views on science and technology. Total sales of the novel are now believed to be in the neighbourhood of 20 million. *The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy* is one of the two biggest-selling individual SF novels\* of all time, a position it has swapped fairly regularly with *Dune* in the last few years, although a recent boost in sales for *Dune* (driven by the new movie adaptation) have almost certainly moved it back into first place and *Hitch-Hiker's* into second.

As with most versions of the story, *The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy* novel opens with Earth being demolished by the officious and callous Vogons to make room for a hyperspace by-pass. Ford Prefect, a field researcher for the eponymous book who has been conducting research on Earth for fifteen years, elects to rescue his best friend Arthur Dent from certain death and they flee into deep space. After an improbable meeting with Ford's semi-cousin Zaphod Beeblebrox (the part-time Galactic President who's now on the run after stealing a hyper-advanced starship for no rational reason), they find themselves caught up in a wild, ancient conspiracy involving god-like computers, dolphins, mice, an alien fjord-designer and, of course, the number 42, which holds the key to the secrets of life, the universe, and everything. Or it would, if anyone knew what the hell the question was.

Sadly, Douglas Adams passed away in 2001 at the far-too-young age of 49 and is not here to celebrate the milestone his famous novel has achieved. However, I am certain that, demolition of the Earth by bad poetry-reciting aliens allowing, the novel will still be going strong in another 42 years from now.

\*Sales estimates of *The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy* are complicated due to the fact that it is a very short novel, so for most of its existence it has been published in handy omnibus formats with various of its sequels; the biggest-selling edition of the book is believed to be a 1985 omnibus edition that packaged it with its three immediate sequels: *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* (1980), *Life, the Universe and Everything* (1982) and *So Long and Thanks For All the Fish* (1984). After 1992, this was supplanted by a five-volume omnibus that added *Mostly Harmless* (1992), the final book in the series. However, *Dune* has a similar estimate problem due to the extreme popularity of a hardcover omnibus that contains the first three books in its series which has been in print since the late 1970s. Sales of the two works appear to be roughly comparable.",Fantasy

The metaphor of orcs in lotr seems pretty clear to me. They are industrialization incarnate. Elves who got twisted by sauron's war machine, people turned into tools. The urakhai are an extension of it, not only are they tools, but they are tools which are replaced, made so far removed from the original that they aren't even ever children. They are expendable, they are miserable, they are twisted and corrupted beings who twist and corrupt and destroy the world around them.  Destroy what is beautiful and use it as fuel.

Its a pretty fascinating original fantasy monster, and one I REALLY like... which surprised me because I have not liked any version of orcs I have previously seen.  Mostly it's the tusks, which I am just not a fan of in character design, but every other version of orcs I have seen always goes for either the ""proud warrior race""  or ""noble savage shamans"" type, both of which are not my thing, and seem like the DIRECT OPPOSITE of lotr orcs. They aren't proud, they hate nature, they don't seem spiritual in the least. And I am just kind of confused about how we got from lotr's industry incarnate to Eberron's druidic protectors of nature.

Thank you.


You have thousands of reviews, and millions of people enjoying your novels, but every author wants to know that their work has meaning, that their work has touched people's lives. 


My mother passed away on the night of Feburary 10th. It was her that pulled my sister and I into reading.  She said that ""she fell in love with words, and how they can touch a heart, and make you think.""



My mother filled my sister and my lives with whimsy and magic.  Trips to the library every summer, painting unicorns on our walls, hunting for fairies, and so so many books.  We three were fantasy's wild children.  She was such a well-read woman, but fantasy was her home.



One of the last series we read together was The Stormlight Archives.  I would tuck her in at night, and we'd talk for way to long about our adventures in the books.  Where we were at, our theories, the excitement. I don't know how many times I would say goodnight, only to come right back and keep talking.



I remember the part where Kaladin was tied outside and the storm was coming.  I ran out of my room because I just had to talk to my mom about it.  When your third book comes out, I don't know what I'm going to do.  I'm so sad she won't get to finish the series.



She would always ask me though, ""Where is he with the third book now?"", because she knew I was watching your website tracker.



She loved Hoid, he made her laugh. And she'd want you to know that she thought you did the Wheel of Time justice. She said no one could have done it but you. When I took her to the doctor, we would listen to Writing Excuses, she loved the way you talked about writing.



I'm so lost and I may even regret writing this later. But, I wanted to thank you.  You gave us so many happy moments together during some really hard times.  



Thank you for the gift of your words, Mr Sanderson.

1666202831.0,Is reading The Wheel of Time worth it? Here's my argument that it is.,"*The Wheel of Time* is 14 books long and some Brandon Sanderson fans read it because Sanderson wrote the last three books. But that means reading 11 books to get to the last three, so is it worth it?

I say it is. I've read the series four times. But I do think some warnings are in order.

First, the first book in the series, *The Eye of the World*, was published in 1990 when every publisher wanted the next *The Lord of the Rings*. So author Robert Jordan made it deliberately Tolkienesque. Yet it takes a sharp turn in book 2 and never looks back. And a close reading of tEotW reveals many cracks in the Tolkienesque facade, foreshadowing how it will fall apart in book 2 and the rest of the series.

Second, WoT has an ensemble of main characters. We meet many but not all of them in the first book. They go through a lot of changes over 14 books. The character arcs are wild. Characters you dislike at first become fan favorites, and characters you like at first may become less likable. So if you are getting tired of certain characters, just give it time.

Third, the world in which it the story is set gets stranger and stranger over the course of the series, as the characters from a little village explore more cultures. Robert Jordan leaned into that strangeness. If it seems too normal and recognizable at the beginning, just wait.

Fourth, *The Wheel of Time* had a huge impact on the fantasy genre. It serves as a transition between Tolkien and the grimdark fantasies that have become popular today. On the one hand, there's still a Tolkienesque conflict between Good and Evil. But the ""free peoples"" are not all so free, and often fight amongst themselves as much as they fight the Dark One and his minions. Along with Robert E. Howard's Conan stories or Tolkien's Middle-Earth stories, WoT is one of the landmark works of fantasy that impacted all future fantasy authors, because each of those authors had to choose whether to be like or unlike this mountainous work in their genre.

Fifth, for Sanderson fans, I actually like Sanderson's work on WoT better than any of his other books because of the blend of Jordan's eccentric brilliance and Sanderson's more straightforward approach. And new readers have the advantage of being able to binge the whole series, rather than waiting on each new book, and wondering if it would ever be finished after Jordan died.

But keep in mind that because the books were published far apart, and because the story is so long, Jordan sometimes offered summaries of what happened in previous books. The advantage of this is that you can read the series quickly without fear of forgetting anything important. If it's important, Jordan will remind you. The disadvantage is that sometimes the pace of the story may seem slow, in which case I encourage you to just read faster, skimming if necessary.

Finally, the WoT series has a lot of flaws as well as strengths. But there's something about a 14-volume story that's just unlike anything shorter. To give you an idea of what I mean, Sanderson was originally hired to finish the series in one volume, and even he couldn't do it. Instead he asked for and received permission to wrap it all up in merely three giant volumes, and was remarkably efficient in doing so.",Fantasy
1608378528.0,Aragorn's Origins: How Does a Ranger Become a King?,"You guys had a lot of lovely things to say about last week's Lord of the Rings post, so here's another...

There are few characters in the Lord of the Rings who are more crucial to the plot than Aragorn. He’s a guide to the Hobbits, a champion to the Rohirrm, and a king to the Men of Gondor. In fact of the six books that make up the Lord of the Rings, more of them feature Aragorn than either Frodo or the Ring. In his first appearance at the Prancing Pony, he is simply Strider of the wilderness. But only seven months later, he is crowned King Elessar of the Dúnedain. So how does a ranger from the North become king in the South? And what exactly was Aragorn doing in the eighty-seven years leading up to it?

So in order to fully understand how a ranger can become a king, we first need to go all the way back to the moment of Aragorn’s birth. Because just like his father and grandfather before him, Aragorn was actually born into royalty. His ancestors were kings. His name literally means “*Revered King*”. And yet Aragorn was born with no lands to rule. He was an Heir of Isildur, but he had no kingdom to inherit. All he had was his name.

You see back in the early Third Age, the proud Kingdom of Arnor - the Kingdom of Elendil and Isildur - fell to the power of the Witch-king. Almost a thousand years before Aragorn was even born, the kings of both Arnor and Gondor were wiped out, and all that remained of Isildur’s descendants were the humble Chieftains of the Dúnedain. The Chieftains of the Rangers of the North. And at the time of Aragorn’s birth, these rangers had fallen on hard times.

So just as Aragorn is an Heir of Isildur, so too was his father Arathorn, and his grandfather Arador. But unfortunately, being an Heir of Isildur comes with its fair share of dangers. You see, although the strength of the Dúnedain had significantly waned since the days of Isildur, the very fact that they still existed, made them a threat to Sauron. And Sauron knew it. He feared the heirs of the man who cut the ring from his finger, and so as long as the Dark Lord endured, the Heirs of Isildur were not safe.

The year before Aragorn was born, his grandfather Arador was captured and killed by trolls of the Coldfells. And only three years later, Aragorn’s father, Arathorn, was slain by an orc arrow through the eye. So, when Aragorn was only two years old, he became the *last* surviving Heir of Isildur. Eighty-five years before the Lord of the Rings, the future of the Dúnedain rested upon the fate of a baby. A baby who was destined to be king.

Now, over the course of Aragorn’s story we’ll see that there are a number of notable symmetries between Aragorn, and two of his (exceedingly) distant ancestors from the First Age – Beren and Tuor. You see all three of these guys were mighty rulers of Men, who’d had their realms conquered by the Enemy before they were full-grown. All three of them lost their fathers at a young age, and crucially, all three of them went on to take an exceptional Elf as their bride. Now it’s hardly an essential detail, but I will point out that Aragorn and his ancestor Tuor *both* lost their respective fathers to a poisoned orc arrow through the eye, within just a year or so of being born. Now I’m not really sure if this is a thought-provoking parallel, or just a strangely specific coincidence, but either way, it is kind of interesting.

Anyway, the real question here revolves around why Aragorn grows up to be a king of the Dúnedain, when all the previous Heirs of Isildur were simply chieftains. What did Aragorn have that his ancestors didn’t?

So it obviously goes without saying that Aragorn did indeed survive his childhood, but he didn’t do so as a Ranger of the North. You see, Aragorn’s mother was a woman called Gilraen, and with Arathorn dead, Gilraen brought her son, in secret, to the Elven refuge of Rivendell. And there, Aragorn first met Lord Elrond. Now if you’re primarily familiar with the Lord of the Rings movies, then you may be of the understanding that Elrond and Aragorn have a bit of an uneasy relationship, but in Tolkien’s writings, this couldn’t be further from the truth.

Tolkien tells us “*Elrond took the place of his father and came to love him as a son.”* He raised Aragorn in Rivendell as one of “*his own*,” and although Aragorn was too young to retain any memory of Arathorn or his life among the Rangers, in the House of Elrond, Aragorn grew up to be *“elven-wise”.* And this is certainly a big deal in explaining Aragorn’s rise from ranger to king, but it’s not something that’s unique to Aragorn. It was a in fact a tradition amongst the Dúnedain for the Heirs of Isildur to be fostered by the Elves in Rivendell. And both Arathorn and Arador also spent their childhoods with Lord Elrond. But in Aragorn’s case, there was something different.

You see, it was decided by the Wise that Aragorn’s name and lineage should be kept a secret until he came of age. Not only would this protect the last Heir of Isildur from the dangers of the outside world, but it also prevented Sauron from learning of his existence. And so, throughout all of Aragorn’s formative years, he was known simply as *Estel* – which means ‘trust’ and ‘hope’ in the Elvish language.

And to be honest, Tolkien doesn’t tell us very much about Aragorn’s boyhood, but I reckon it must have been pretty amazing. I mean just imagine what it would be like for a mortal Man to be raised entirely amongst Elves. We’re told that by the time Aragorn was twenty, he was “*fair and noble and was early come to manhood.”* And just like his father and grandfather before him, Aragorn developed a cherished friendship with Elrond’s twin sons, the Elven rangers Elladan and Elrohir. In fact, in his youth Aragorn ventured off into the wilds with these adoptive brothers, and I imagine it was at this time that he developed many of the skills we’ll later see during the Lord of the Rings. We know that Aragorn is a gifted ranger, and an excellent tracker, and an exceptional healer, and yet he didn’t acquire these skills from the Dúnedain. Instead, Aragorn’s abilities come from the Elves.

However, Aragorn’s youthful days as Estel did of course have to come to an end, and when he turned twenty-one, and “*returned to Rivendell after great deeds in the company of the sons of Elrond”,* it was time for Estel to learn the truth. So in the year 2952, Lord Elrond called Aragorn by his true name for the first time, and he presented Aragorn with heirlooms from the House of Isildur. Now of these heirlooms, three are particularly important in explaining Aragorn’s journey from ranger to king. One of these heirlooms is the broken blade Narsil, which was of course used to cut the One Ring from Sauron’s finger, and will of course one day be reforged into Andúril; and another heirloom is the Ring of Barahir, which is the same ring that we see Aragorn wearing in the movies. Now this ring has a bit of a crazy history, and it’s very possibly the single oldest piece of jewellery in Middle-earth. It predates the Rings of Power by thousands of years, and it’s even older than the sun and the moon. And unfortunately there’s nowhere near enough time to fully explain how this ring ended up in Isildur’s possession, but way back, possibly around ten thousand years ago, its original owner was actually Galadriel’s older brother. And he gave this ring to a mortal Man called Barahir. And as it goes, Barahir was the father of Aragorn’s First Age ancestor Beren. So this Ring of Barahir is a big deal, and it’s a hugely significant part of Aragorn’s family history.

Now the last heirloom of Isildur’s that Elrond had in his possession was a silver rod called the Sceptre of Annúminas. And this Sceptre of Annúminas was also ancient, and it originally belonged to Elendil - the first High King of the Dúnedain. The sceptre was both an artefact of Númenor and a symbol of the Ancient Kings of Men. But unlike the Shards of Narsil and the Ring of Barahir, Elrond did not give the Sceptre of Annúminas to Aragorn. For Aragorn was not yet a king. Instead he told his adopted son that the Sceptre *“I withhold, for you have yet to earn it.”* But he also told Aragorn *“that the span of your life shall be greater than the measure of Men, unless evil befalls you or you fail at the test.”*

Now this test is very important. In fact I would argue that it is critical in understanding Aragorn’s journey from ranger to king. And it’s also critical in unravelling the character of Aragorn in the books from Aragorn in the movies.

So I feel most people will agree that Viggo Mortensen did a fantastic job at portraying Aragorn in Peter Jackson’s films; I personally don’t have a bad thing to say about him. But the way that the character is written in the movies is very different from how he’s written in the books. You know, in the movies he’s afflicted with doubt about his destiny, but Tolkien actually tells us that after learning the truth of his heritage, Aragorn’s *“heart was high within him…for he was full of hope.”* It seems that Aragorn agreed with his adoptive father’s assertion that the kingship had to be earned. And I believe that this desire to earn his destiny, and to prove himself worthy of Isildur and his heirs, is a critical part of what motivates Aragorn throughout the next six decades of his life.

However, before I get too far ahead of myself, there’s one more character that needs to be introduced to this story. Because although Elrond, and Elladan, and Elrohir are all crucial players in Aragorn’s youth, there’s one more member of their family who’s remained conspicuously absent up until this point.

You see, *literally* the very next day after learning the truth about his lineage, Aragorn went out into the woods for a solitary walk. And whilst he was out, he began singing a song called the *Lay of Lúthien,*which tells the story of how that distant ancestor Beren, first encountered the angelic Elf-maiden Lúthien, AKA his future wife. Now there’s definitely more than one example of symmetry between Aragorn and Beren, but right here we see what is perhaps the most striking one. Because we’re told that while Aragorn was singing this song about Beren and Lúthien, “*Lúthien walked before his eyes in Rivendell.”* And I feel like this must have been an incredibly surreal moment for Aragorn; partly because Lúthien was his grandmother 67 times removed, and also partly because she’d been dead for 6480 years by this point. Also she lived thousands of miles away in a part of the world that doesn’t even exist anymore, so you probably don’t need me to tell you that it turns out, Aragorn was mistaken. The woman who stood before him “*clad in a mantle of silver and blue, fair as the twilight”* was not in fact the ghost of Lúthien, but instead she was her great great granddaughter. Arwen Undómiel.

Now we all know that Arwen’s father was Aragorn’s adoptive father, and we all know that Arwen’s brothers were Aragorn’s adoptive brothers, but thankfully, Arwen and Aragorn never had any sort of brother/sister relationship. And this is because, throughout Aragorn’s first twenty-one years of life, Arwen had been entirely absent from Rivendell. Instead of living with her father and brothers, she’d been living far away in Lothlórien, with her grandparents Galadriel and Celeborn. And so, only one day after learning the truth about his heritage, Aragorn met Arwen for the very fist time. And Tolkien tells us that in this moment, Aragorn believed he’d “*strayed into a dream.”*

Now, apparently Aragorn isn’t particularly great at hiding his emotions, because “*in the* *days that followed”* both his mother Gilraen, and Lord Elrond, “*perceived that some strange thing had come over him.”* And although I don’t believe Elrond was exactly thrilled about his adoptive son falling in love with his only daughter, he wasn’t quite as grumpy about it as he is in the movies. We’re told that Elrond said to Aragorn “*the years will bring what they will. We will speak no more of this until many have passed.”* And it appears that Aragorn agreed to his adoptive father’s terms, because the very next day after this conversation, “*he took leave lovingly of Elrond,”* and disappeared into the wild for nearly thirty years!

And I guess these years mark a really significant turning point in Aragorn’s life. Because up until this departure, he’d lived his whole life as Estel, but in the space of only a few days, Aragorn had learned the truth about his ancestry, he’d inherited two out of three heirlooms of Isildur’s, and he’d come face to face with the woman he’d eventually end up marrying. And so I believe it’s during these years in the wilderness that Estel of Rivendell truly grows into Aragorn of the Dúnedain. And Tolkien actually gives us some really cool details about what Aragorn was getting up during these long years in the wild.

So for the first four years of his travels, it seems that Aragorn stayed in the North, and he explored the lands of his ancestors and his kin. And it’s during these years of wandering the North that Aragorn first encountered his future friend, Gandalf the Grey. And it was actually upon the wizard’s advice that Aragorn first began to take an interest in the secretive northern realm known as the Shire. Over the course of his travels, the Men of the North came to know Aragorn by reputation, but he kept his true identity a secret from all save his fellow rangers. And so, as the years went on Aragorn became known in the North as Strider. And this is a name he’ll carry with him for the rest of his life. In fact when Aragorn eventually does become King Elessar, he adopts the name Telcontar as the name of his Royal House, and his family name. And what Telcontar literally means is simply Strider, in the Quneya language of the High Elves.

Anyway, while Aragorn lingered in the North, all was not well in the South. Only a few years after he left Rivendell, “*Mount Doom burst into flame”,* and in the very same year that Aragorn learned of his lineage, “*Sauron declared himself openly…*\[and\] *began the rebuilding of Barad-dûr.”* So at the age of just twenty-six, Aragorn undertook his first great journey into the South, and for the first time in his life, he passed into the lands of Rohan and Gondor. And for the next twenty-three years, Aragorn aided the Free Peoples of the West, in their renewed war against Sauron.

In fact, it was during this time, that Aragorn first encountered a few familiar faces from the Lord of the Rings, including a nine-year-old Théoden, and a twenty-seven year old Denethor. However just as he did while living in the North, Aragorn kept his heritage and his true name a secret. And so to the Men of Rohan and Gondor, Aragorn became known as Thorongil, which means *The Eagle of the Star, “for he was swift and keen-eyed, and wore a silver star upon his cloak.”*

Now, Tolkien doesn’t tell us very much about Thorongil’s exploits in Rohan, except that for some time he rode alongside Théoden’s father King Tengel. But he does give us some very cool details about what Thorongil got up to in Gondor. You see Denethor’s father, and Boromir’s grandfather, was the Steward Ecthelion, and we’re told that Ecthelion was “*a man of wisdom”* who *“began to strengthen his realm against the assault of Mordor.”* And so, Ecthelion encouraged *“all men of worth”* to come to Minas Tirith and to enter his service. And of course the captain that Ecthelion “*loved above all”* was Thorongil.

Now Thorongil certainly made a name for himself in Minas Tirith, and his greatest achievement came during his campaign against Gondor’s ancestral enemies, the Corsairs of Umbar. Tolkien tells us that with Ecthelion’s leave, Throrongil “*gathered a small fleet”* and sailed into Umbar under the cover of night. There he “*burned* *a great part of the ships of the Corsairs”* and he even killed their Captain in single combat upon the quays. However when the time came for the victorious fleet of Gondorians to return to Minas Tirith, and to receive the favour of Ecthelion, Thorongil departed, and he journeyed alone towards the Mountains of Mordor. And as it turns out, Aragorn would not set foot in Minas Tirith again, until he came to the Houses of Healing after the Battle of Pelennor Fields.

You see, although pretty much everyone in Gondor absolutely loved Thorongil, there was one person who didn’t. And that person was that Ecthelion’s son and heir, Denethor. Now we’re told that Denethor was “*subtle in mind and looked further and deeper than other men of his day.”* And it’s implied that Denethor was the only one who discovered the truth about Thorongil’s identity. And it seems he feared that Thorongil would one day supplant him as the future ruler of Gondor. Which technically, he wasn’t wrong to worry about.

But anyway just before I move one, there’s one more potentially really lovely detail here. Because two years before Aragorn’s battle with the Corsairs, Denethor’s wife gave birth to their first son. And this son is of course Boromir. So it’s very possible that perhaps Aragorn and Boromir may have met, right at the beginning of Boromir’s life. Perhaps Aragorn even held him as a baby. Now it’s incredibly unlikely that Boromir would ever have known about this, but if we skip forward just under forty years to the end of Boromir’s life, then we’ll find that Aragorn is there once again, holding Boromir in his arms as he dies. It’s another really beautiful moment of potential symmetry.

Anyway, after leaving Gondor and Rohan, Aragorn’s life once again becomes a bit of a mystery. Tolkien tells us that he ventured southeast, and he even journeyed into the lands around Mordor. We know that he explored “*the hearts of men good and evil”* and he discovered many of the “*plots and devices”* that were contrived by the servants of Sauron. However beyond that, Aragorn’s odyssey through the lands of the Enemy remains a mystery.

But eventually, Aragorn’s days of wandering the wilds did come to an end. And at the ripe old age of forty-nine, Aragorn returned from the lands of shadow to seek rest and recuperation once again with the Elves. However this time it wasn’t Elrond or his sons in Rivendell that Aragorn sought shelter with, but instead, he came to the hidden realm of Lothlórien, where he first encountered the Lady Galadriel and her husband Celeborn.

Now, I guess it’s fair to say that when Aragorn first arrived in Lothlórien he probably wasn’t looking his best. I mean he’d just spent a good deal of time wandering around “*the dark confines of Mordor”* so I imagine he wasn’t really dressed to impress. But, good old Galadriel perceived that Aragorn was now “*grown to full stature of body and mind”,* and so she gave him what I can really only describe as a makeover. We’re told that Galadriel “*clothed him in silver and white, with a cloak of elven-grey and a bright gem upon his brow.”* And this restyling is important, because what happens next is the final catalyst in Aragorn’s journey from ranger to king.

You see, what Aragorn did not know, was that in the nearly thirty years since he’d left Rivendell, Arwen had also travelled back to Lothlórien. And she just so happened to be there at the same time as Aragorn. And this is where we see a lovely little reversal of Aragorn and Arwen’s first encounter all those years ago. Because it’s while Arwen is out walking beneath the golden trees of her grandparent’s realm, that she and Aragorn are once again reunited. And because Aragorn is dressed in the fine raiment that Galadriel gave him, Arwen at first mistakes him for an “*Elf-lord from the Isles of the West.”*And so, it’s in this moment that Arwen makes the all-important choice that will decide not only her fate, but also the fate of the Dúnedain.

You see, for one whole season Aragorn and Arwen “*wandered together in the glades of Lothlórien.”* And on Midsummer’s Eve, Aragorn removed the Ring of Barahir from his finger, and he presented it to Arwen, as a symbol of their betrothal.

Now when Elrond learned of his daughter’s engagement, I think it’s fair to say he was somewhat conflicted, but he certainly didn’t blame Aragorn for Arwen’s choice. And thirty years after their original conversation about Aragorn’s love for his daughter, Elrond said to his adopted son “*though I love you, I say to you: Arwen Undómiel shall not diminish her life’s grace for…any Man less than the King of both Gondor and Arnor.”*

And so, with that sentence, Elrond set in motion the return of the King. To earn the love of Arwen Undómiel “*Aragorn went forth again to danger and toil.”* And the next time he crops up in the story is just after the eleventy-first birthday party of Bilbo Baggins. Now Aragorn does go on one more epic adventure to hunt down Gollum before showing up in Prancing Pony, but this pretty much catches us up with the Strider that we’re all familiar with from the Fellowship of the Ring.

So, let’s think back for a moment to those three heirlooms of Isildur’s. By the time of the Lord of the Rings, the Ring of Barahir belonged to Arwen, the Sceptre of Annúminas was kept by Elrond, and the reforged shards of Narsil were borne by Aragorn. Over the next three months, Aragorn undertook his second great journey from Rivendell to Gondor. And although he definitely took his sweet time in getting there, when Aragorn finally did arrive at Minas Tirith, aboard the Black Ships of the Corsairs, he brought hope (pun intended) to the Fields of Pelennor. Now I know in the movies Aragorn just kind of shows up with an Army of the Dead, but in Tolkien’s writings, the Oathbreakers had already served their purpose by then. Instead, Aragorn arrived at the battle with the twin sons of Elrond, a company of Rangers from the North, and an army of reinforcements from the Outlands of Gondor. Just as all hope seemed lost for the Men of the West, Aragorn unfurled the black and silver standard of Elendil and Isildur - a standard that had been stitched for him by Arwen - and he led his people to victory. He brought the sword that was broken to the City of Kings, and he revealed to Sauron that Isildur’s Heir had finally returned.

And only ten days later, Sauron was destroyed with the One Ring. Only forty-five days later, Aragorn was crowned king. And only three months later, Arwen and Elrond arrived in Minas Tirith where they beheld King Elessar for the first time. The three heirlooms of Isildur’s House were finally reunited.

At Aragorn‘s side lay Andúril. Upon Arwen’s finger sat the Ring of Barahir. And in Elrond’s hand was the Sceptre of Annúminas. So, on Midsummer’s Eve, thirty-nine years to the day since his daughter’s betrothal in Lothlórien, Elrond finally presented the Sceptre of Annúminas to his adopted son. And the very next day, Arwen married the High King of the Dúnedain.

So if we look back now to our original questions, how does a ranger become a king? I guess what the answer ultimately boils down to, is love. What did Aragorn have that his ancestors didn’t? Well, in terms of heritage and birthright and upbringing, they were all pretty much the same. But Aragorn had the love of Arwen. Aragorn earned her hand in marriage, and so for the sake of spending his life with the Elf-maiden he loved, Aragorn united the ancient Kingdoms of the Dúnedain, and he fulfilled his destiny as Isildur’s Heir.

For one hundred and twenty-two years, Aragorn ruled alongside his Queen, and together they founded a new dynasty for the Dúnedain that lasted long into the Fourth Age. And when his time finally did come, Aragorn walked the Silent Street of Minas Tirith, he lay down in his bed, and with his family at his side, he allowed himself to die. Arwen endured a single winter of grief without her husband, and she journeyed alone into the east until she came back to the now empty lands of Lothlórien. And there, she too “*laid herself to rest”,* and she joined her husband in death.

Throughout the Legendarium there are loads of kings. Some are great. Some are terrible. Some are in-between. But I would argue that there’s no other king in Middle-earth’s history who truly earns his right to rule in the same way that Aragorn does. He was born into a *“ragged house long bereft of lordship"",* but in the years between meeting Arwen, and eventually marrying her, Aragorn redeemed the House of Isildur, he united the Men of the West, and he ruled as the High King of all Dúnedain.

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on this amazing character. As some of you may know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

>  
>\- **The Farthest Shore**

Ursula K. Le Guin's career spanned over 60 years. She gave the world 20+ novels and 100+ short stories. Many people were first introduced to her work as children through the amazing world of Earthsea, following the wizard Ged. She was the first woman to win the Hugo and Nebula Awards for best novel with **The Left Hand of Darkness**. She was the second woman to be honored as a Grand Master of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. She also received huge acclaim outside the sff community, being named a living legend by the US Library of Congress in 2000, and winning the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 2014.

I came to her books late in life. As a teen my dad handed me his old, battered copy of **The Left Hand of Darkness** and I never read it because I didn't like the cover (sorry dad!). So I discovered her books in university and let them take me on a magical journey I never want to end. Every time I return to Earthsea I feel my heart stop, as the characters, the world, and prose sweeps me away. I still have many of her books to read, though my collection is slowly amassing.

In many ways her passing marked a shift, a great loss of a giant of classic sff. ""What now?"" I remember thinking, when I read the news. I think though, that as long as people read your books, a person is never truly gone. And I can see her influence in many of the contemporary authors being published today.

Today, I want to remember, celebrate her memory, the influence of her work. Share how her books impacted you, your favourite stories, and more.",Fantasy

I knew *of* Critical Role but had never read, watched, or listened to any of it. So, aside from knowing that this story was based off one of their early (earliest?) campaigns, I was going in blind.

And gottdang, I am really enjoying it. The characters are great, the plot is engaging, the fight scenes are cool AF, and I'm really digging the lore. I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about it after the first episode because I'm kinda tired of shows being too aware of themselves and making some sort of metacommentary on the thing that they are.

1622486247.0,"Kate Elliott on writing female characters: ""Get rid of the 'unknowable Other'""","Kate Elliott is, in my opinion, one of the most criminally underappreciated writers in SFF. *Black Wolves* probably ranks in my Top 5 Favorite Epic Fantasies of the 2010s, and I've been reading *Crown of Stars* (partly to console myself after *Black Wolves'* sequel was axed) with the utmost pleasure. Even *The Spiritwalker Trilogy*, while I had some issues with the romantic plot (>!no woman should ever live Happily Ever After with a man who has tried to murder her!<), is among my favorites.

But I believe that of all I've read of her work, the one I admire most is an essay entitled ""Writing Women Characters as Human Beings"": [https://www.tor.com/2015/03/04/writing-women-characters-as-human-beings/](https://www.tor.com/2015/03/04/writing-women-characters-as-human-beings/)

While the essay makes quite a few strong points, the one I can't get out of my head, as one of the most practical pieces of advice that too many people consistently fail to follow, is, ""Get rid of . . . the idea of an unknowable Other with a mysterious psychology."" This makes perfect sense to me, not only in writing characters but in living and relating to people in the real world. This is what I would have said in the ""Authors Who Can't Write Female Characters Can't Write Characters"" thread, if it hadn't been locked before I got to it.

Authors too often fail to write convincing characters, of one gender or another, because consciously or unconsciously they have too much invested in identifying those characters as ""not like me,"" and fixating on the traits that distinguish that character from themselves. They think of ""Women,"" or ""Men,"" as a plural, a group-mind that share a narrow selection of traits that are presumably rooted in their gender, rather than seeing the character of the gender different from themselves as a distinct individual with a personality that transcends stereotype. While I wouldn't go quite so far as to say that if they can't write characters of a different gender well or convincingly, that means they can't write characters *at all*, I would say it's a flaw that's worth talking about. It's also a dealbreaker for me as a reader. Nothing throws me out of a story faster than a sense of being ""Othered,"" so I avoid writers who have a well-documented reputation for writing female characters as an incomprehensible ""Them"" (as in ""Us"" vs. ""Them"").

I just wish there weren't so *many* fantasy writers with this kind of reputation. Gene Wolfe, Robert Jordan, Piers Anthony, R. Scott Bakker, Brent Weeks, Peter V. Brett, Patrick Rothfuss, Roger Zelazny, Terry Goodkind, David Gemmell, Jim Butcher, David Eddings, Brian McClelland (at least in the first Powder Mage Trilogy), Kevin Hearne (at least in the Iron Druid). That's not even counting classic SF writers like Azimov, Heinlein, Niven, etc. (I think the only man of that crowd that got it right was James Schmitz.) Then there are those *women* who struggle to write female characters convincingly, perhaps because they're more interested in crafting hyper-idealized portraits of awesome men (e.g. Stephenie Meyer, Kel Kade, Anne Rice). It makes me sigh to myself, *Are people like me really* ***that*** *hard to write?*

I also think maybe we don't talk enough about those who write *all* their characters well, without any subconscious Othering creeping in. A few who come to mind are Peter S. Beagle, Curtis Craddock, Django Wexler, Robert Jackson Bennett, Max Gladstone, as well as Robin Hobb, Elliott herself, Jen Williams, Sharon Shinn, Juliet Marillier, Naomi Novik.",Fantasy

1612398028.0,Dresden files. I didn't think i needed it until i started reading it or why palate cleansers are a big deal.,"I'm not that experienced fantasy reader, but 2020, for obvious reasons, was a perfect year to start.

In last 3 months of 2020 I've binged the entire ASOIAF, mistborn era 1, book of the ancestor, a lot of novels and non-fiction.

And now, after i finished book 3 of the wheel of time series, i was done. Burned out. I just didn't want to start book 4, another heavy trilogy or worse, stormlight archive, but that's what my tbr list is, basically.

And then i remembered that Dresden files exist and people say it's a good palate cleanser series.

To be honest, the concept of reading lighter books to refresh my brain after heavy books was completely foreign to me. What do you mean i can read something when I'm tired of reading to relax and keep reading?

But when i picked up storm front, it clicked. It feels so good. No huge info dumps, no 22 Jons where one of the main character's name is Jon, no huge worldbuilding terminology and vocabulary. And so on. Just read and enjoy.

I'm definitely not saying that Dresden files is dumb fantasy that serves no purpose but relaxation. But i appreciate now something simple, easy, a single pov.

I am now certain that it is a great idea to introduce in schools, because my god they love shoving huge and heavy pieces of classics one after another for 10 months straight.

What is your palate cleanser material? Do you feel that it's a necessity or i am a wuss?

1496505106.0,Why Del Rey and I will be parting ways,"My wife, Robin, was doing some preparation work for contract negotiations with Del Rey for:

* The last two books in the Legends of the First Empire series
* The first book in a new series which falls between First Empire and Legends.

Turns out the negotiations are dead even before they started, and since I often talk about the ""publishing side of business"" here. I thought I would share what is going on.

So a few things to know before we get started.

* Del Rey's deal for the first three books of Legends of the First Empire (and one yet to be named book in Elan) was something I was (and am) extremely pleased about. Publisher's Weekly ranks deals in a number of categories the top being a ""Major Deal"" (which kicks in at $500,000 and the 4-book ebook/print deal would fall in there). I feel that the offer showed them to be a fan of a work and respected what I was capable of.

* Age of Myth (book #1) has done extremely well. We haven't yet hit the 1 year mark and already it has sold just a bit shy of 115,000 copies in the English language. It surpassed its thresholds for the hardcover ""escalators"" (if you don't know what that is, I'll talk about it in the comments if you ask). It also has incredible ratings (14,850) with 89.3% in the 4- & 5-star range, 8.4% with 3-star, and only 2.3% with 1- & 2-star.  It also was a Goodreads Choice Award Nominee, picked by Amazon, Audible, and AudioFile Magazine as one of the Best Fantasy books of 2016,  not to mention hitting several other notable bloggers' best-of lists.

* I couldn't be happier with how Del Rey has treated me, and there have been no conflicts with ""creative differences,"" missed deadlines, or other issues that tend to derail authors' careers.

So what's the problem?

We are in a catch-22 because both of us see the audio rights as extremely valuable and refuse to let them go. To give you a little background, I always try to limit the rights transferred in the primary contract. This is why I only do ""World English"" or ""North American English"" and attempt to reserve my audio rights.

When The Riyria Revelations contract was negotiated I asked my agent to retain the audio rights, she said it was a ""deal breaker"" for them so I caved.  Same thing happened with The Riyria Chronicles.  Orbit ended up selling that right to Recorded Books (a  transaction that at it's most took them 10 - 15 hour to do) and the result is that I've had to split more than $145,000 with them 50/50. Not only that, but Recorded Books recently renewed the contract for those books for $400,000 and you guessed it. I only get $200,000 of that money. That kind of ""hit"" hurts...greatly.

Okay, so when it came to the Legends of the First Empire books Robin decided to sell the audio rights first.  That way they would be ""off the table"" and we'd not have to split the profits with anyone. We sold the first 4 books to Recorded books for what PW would term as a ""good deal"" ($100,000 - $250,000). 

Getting just the ebook & print for the English language wasn't a problem for Del Rey and so every one was happy.

Now, then, we've heard rumblings that publishers are cracking down on requiring audio rights, but that they are also not willing to increase the advances to account for having them. It was important to find out what the value of these were so we could make informed decisions so we started shopping the various books I have ""in the works"" to a number of audio publishers and found out...they're worth a lot.  Like 7-figures for thee books a lot. That's MUCH, MUCH more than my first ""major deal"" (and it was my first 7-figure deal ever). So...I signed up the books, as it provided me a level of stability that is hard to come by in this business. I did so knowing full well that it might jeopardize the print and ebook versions. But it was, as they say making me ""a deal I couldn't refuse.""

Okay, so back to Robin setting the stage for books I've yet to sign for print/ebook which are:

* The last three books of the Legends of the First Empire
* Three books in a new series ""Empire Falls""

She wanted to make sure Del Rey realized that the audio books were sold, so they knew what they could have and what they couldn't -- basically the same as the last contract.  As you might have guessed, the response came back that the CEO at Penguin Random House has made a corporate wide decree that states, that editors with their imprints (including Del Rey) are ""absolutely, and with no exceptions, forbidden to strike deals anymore that do not include audio rights.""

Now, do I really think there are ""absolutely no exceptions""? No. If Rowling or Stephen King wanted to keep their audio rights, I'm sure they would be able to. Likewise, if an author is selling very little in audio, I'm sure they wouldn't care if they were kept. But I seem to be in that spot where I'm not ""big enough"" to waive audio and my audio sales are too large for them to ignore. 

And, so that, as they say is that.

So, what does all that mean for my books going forward?  Not too terribly much. I wouldn't have made that gamble without other alternatives. It could be that there are other fantasy publishers that will pick me up without audio rights (Orbit and Del Rey are definitely out), but even if they don't I have a strong record of producing high-quality self-published books. My sales may be lower (due to lack of bookstore exposure) but you'll still be able to get the books (a) directly from me or  (b) from on-line retailers.  Also, you may not be able to find the books in the library, but maybe I'll start my own ""lending program"" for people who want to go that way.   No worries, books will still be coming out, but I may need to do some regrouping as we explore the various opportunities.

Anyway, this may be of absolutely no interested to anyone. But I thought getting it ""out there"" would help assuage any rumors that Del Rey and I are breaking because of a conflict of any kind, or because of low sales with my books. It's ironic. We (I and Del Rey) both want to continue working together, both are finding financial benefit from the arrangement and yet we can't keep doing what we've been doing. It's a crazy business!",Fantasy

1593368118.0,I owe an apology to the great Brandon Sanderson,"Back in the day teenage me had beef with Sanderson and refused to read any of his works. Why the vendetta you ask? Well I am also a fan of the Wheel of Time series. I vividly recall reading an advertisement for one of Sanderson books and was shocked to see the ad read, “From the author of Wheel of Time.” I was incensed, how dare he ride on Robert Jordan’s coat tails when he only helped finish the last book! From that day forward, I vowed to never pick up one of his novels.

Fast forward to quarantine, audible was having a sale and I grudgingly picked out a Skyward because so many users on r/fantasy raved about him. All I can say I was wrong, woeful misguided and I regret not reading him sooner.

Not since Tamara Pierce have I seen such a strong, well written female heroine. I absolutely love his writing style; how he can intermix comedy and drama so I’m laughing, crying and yelling one moment to the next. His world building was immersive and not the same rehash of old fantasy/sci-fi tropes. Usually I take my time with audio books, but I couldn’t stop listening and burned through a 15 hour audio book in 2 days.

So here I am. Brandon Sanderson I apologize for my initial judgment. I judged a book by a single cover and paid the price of my arrogance. I will pay penance by doing a deep dive into your works. Where should I start fellow fantasy readers?

[Serious Guardians of the Galaxy energy.](https://preview.redd.it/70mvioakfwoa1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6bcc724c9a785374df7e8328070b5f6fc02825e)

DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS: HONOR AMONG THIEVES made me tear up a bit at  the end. It was an involuntary reaction, I certainly didn’t intend for  it to happen, but it’s something that occurred nevertheless. Against my  better judgement, I came to care about these characters and whether they  managed to make it through the end of the movie. So, in the words of *Rick and Morty*, “You son of a bitch, I’m in.”

The movie isn’t perfect by any stretch of the imagination but it is recognizably and explicitly *Dungeons and Dragons*. Which is a harder thing to embody than many people might think. *Dungeons and Dragons*  isn’t a setting by itself but a method of creating and playing a  setting. This is the problem of previous adaptations because you can  play any fantasy setting with D&D rules but you can’t just say, “*Dungeons and Dragons* is the setting.” Here, it’s the *Forgotten Realms* and I kind of wish they’d called it *Forgotten Realms* or *Neverwinter Nights* because either of those titles would have been appropriate as well.

Energy-wise, this is a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie for better and worse. I honestly compare this most to Paul Rudd’s *Ant Man*  movie in terms of rough mixture between family melodrama, quips, and  action. Well, this has a lot more dragons in it and I’ll give that is an  impressive boost over *Ant Man*. It’s a movie about a failed  father trying to reconnect with his daughter, a heist, and an oddball  crew of misfits. So let’s say *Ant Man* meets *Guardians of the Galaxy*  meets dragons. Which, yes, is probably why I love this movie against my  better judgement. Neither of those films are my favorite Marvel films  but throw in an owlbear and the Red Wizards of Thay? Yeah, now we’re  cooking with fireballs.

The premise is somewhat overly complicated at the start with,  essentially, an entire movie’s worth of backstory in the prologue that  could have been the first part of a trilogy. Edgin Darvis (Chris Pine)  is a Harper who turns to thievery after his do-goodery gets his wife  killed by the Red Wizards. He ends up as heterosexual but platonic  partners with Holga (Michelle Rodriguez) and raises his daughter, Kira,  with her.

Hearing there’s a magical tablet that can raise his wife from the  dead, Edgin robs the Harpers and gets sent to magical prison with Holga  when the heist goes wrong. They break out and decide to get Kira back  from their partner who, obviously, betrayed them but is raising the girl  as his own.

This is just the prologue.

The movie is mostly a heist film with our leads recruiting bumbling  sorcerer Simon Aumar (Justice Smith) and kickass Tiefling druid Doric  (Sophia Lillis) to help take down Lord Forge Fitzwilliam (Hugh Grant) as  well as his Red Wizard partner Sofina (Daisy Head). They go from action  scene and comedy scene to action scene to comedy scene with the movie  never really taking a break. Some of the comedy is stupid like a scene  where they waste their Speak with the Dead questions while other comedy  is stupid but entertaining as hell (Holga’s ex being a halfling? Eh.  Holga’s ex taking up with another Amazonian barbarian? HILARIOUS).

The movie is utterly drenched with fanservice and you’ll be unable to  turn off your brain from the, “I recognize that, they said the thing, I  recognize that, reference to that thing I know!” Memberberries (i.e.  things you remember from your childhood) are a pretty low form of humor  perfected by *Buffy: The Vampire Slay*er and *Iron Man*  but it works on the nerd side of my brain. When they mention Simon is  Elminster’s descendant, I went, “Yeah, him and half of Faerun” and  realized they’d gotten me.

&#x200B;

[Sophia is delightful in this movie even if I confused her for Keylith.](https://preview.redd.it/7jtso5jnfwoa1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a059b53977c44ceaaab51b1eee6b2e0258e03886)

I almost feel bad about how mad I am for unabashedly loving this  movie. I am deeply cynical about Hasbro’s handling of D&D and mad at  them for a dozen things ranging from the OGL to the novels being  abandoned. However, this movie has an morbidly obese red dragon, the  cast of the Eighties *Dungeons and Dragons* cartoon, and Szass  Frigging Tam (who is the villain of my current D&D campaign). What  am I supposed to do with that? I can’t stay mad at a movie trying this  hard to entertain me.

The cast is a bunch of bumbling misfits and everyone looks like an  idiot but Doric (Michelle Rodriguez gets a lot of mileage out of being a  dumb barbarian), yet I can’t complain about that since it’s my style of  humor too. They’re also competent when it counts. I even like Hugh  Grant in this as he basically shows what he would have been like if he’d  play Gilderoy Lockhart in *Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets*.  Literally my only complaints are the fact that I wasn’t aware Faerun  was enlightened enough to have prisons with a healthy pardon system and  the fact movie dragged in literally two places.

1663009888.0,A critique of sexual violence in Fantasy.,"Oftentimes I see people defend several aspects regarding the treatment of women in fantasy books and media by saying ‘that’s how things were’. 

Most times this is false. I have tried to break down the argument into two main sections so I can explain how common perceptions were false. Notably, I only know about European history.

Sexual Assault

Quite a few fantasy books contain sexual assault toward women. I am not going to deny that it happened, as rape, particularly wartime rape did and still does occur. However, Rape in the past was little more prevalent than during modern times. Similarly, rape in the past was often punished, usually much harsher than in modern times. Additionally, Men were often raped at levels similar to women.
In fantasy books, the latter two are often ignored. Most times rape seems to be treated as normal, rather than punished. Additionally, rape seems to be targeted almost exclusively at women.

The first edict against wartime sexual assault was the Cáin Adomnáin. Notably, it was issued in the British Isles and had little influence outside of north western Europe. It explicitly forbade, among other things, raping and killing women. For these crimes it declares of the perpetrator,” his right hand and his left foot shall be cut off before death, and then he shall die."" [1]

The first Europe-wide treaty forbidding rape was the Peace and Truth of God, which was issued in 989 before spreading over Europe over the next century. The first king to accept it was King Robert II of France. Following his acceptance other nobles accepted the Peace and Truth of God in droves. It should be noted that in those times the military was almost entirely comprised of nobles. In Britain, it was standard for the first son to be the heir, the second to join the military, and any subsequent sons to join the monastery to prevent inheritance disputes. It wasn’t until Napoleon that large scale armies became the norm. Slowly, the ideas blended in with general chivalry.

By the time of the 1300’s wartime rape and sexual violence was prosecuted for hindering military operations rather than just for “property crimes” (Since Women were considered the property of either their husband or father). It didn’t take much effort to realise that raping people created a hostile civilian population and having a hostile population would make it far harder to occupy and control territory.  The general line of thought was that when defeating an enemy, treat them so kindly that they would not seek revenge, or treat them so harshly that they could not attain their revenge. [2]

The final major declaration against wartime sexual violence in the medieval era was the De jure belli as pacis, written in 1625. Similar to all previous works, it declared that wartime rape was no less reprehensible than rape during peace time. Notably, this work states that the rules were still valid “even when God were assumed not to exist” [3]

A common argument against this would be that, despite rape and sexual violence being prohibited, soldiers would ignore the laws. In reality that would be true, but there is no evidence to suggest that it happened at greater levels than in the modern time.
The Geneva convention clearly prohibited wartime rape. Despite that, during WW2 soviet soldiers used the system of “from 8 to 80” when deciding to rape women, leading to over two million German women getting raped. [4]

In the present time, 26,000 women have been raped so far in the ongoing Tigray war. In contrast with Fantasy books, novels regarding modern wars usually omit the sexual violence. For those that include it, It is often brief and undescriptive.

Additionally, fantasy books usually only include sexual assault towards women. In reality, both men and women were and are raped in war. During the El Salvadorian dictatorship, 76% of male political prisoners were raped. In the Yugoslav wars, 80% of men in the Sarajevo concentration camp were raped. Even more recent, 22% of men and 30% of women fleeing the eastern Congo reported being raped. [5]

Essentially, saying that’s how things were ignored the reality of the situation. Oftentimes it is only used in defence of the ill-treatment of women while ignoring other aspects of the time.

Young Marriage

Another common misconception is that women would often get married young, sometimes even as children. In reality, the average age for Women was 22.4 and for Men it was 25.9 [6]. Additionally, between 10% and 25% of Women never married [7]. Couples would often delay marriage depending on their economic circumstances. The only notable exception was during the black death when couples would get married as teenagers due to the immense labour shortage. By 1140, the Decretum Gratiani was issued. This stated that the binds of marriage were to be formed by mutual consent and granted Women an equal say in marriage.

Despite this, some noble families would get married young. This was usually in order to secure the future of the family. However, noble families would prevent their children from consummating their marriage until women usually hit the age of 16. The main reason being that they did not want to endanger the health of the women. After all, despite lacking modern medicine it was still common sense that a girl getting pregnant would not only result in a still birth, but would also endanger her health, preventing any future offspring.

1624511987.0,"Why do some authors come across as more poetic? I did a prose analysis of Tolkien, Sanderson, Rothfuss, Jemisin, and Erikson. Here's what I learned","I was looking into prose styles for a video I made recently, and found some interesting stuff. I pulled two paragraphs each from Tolkien, Sanderson, Rothfuss, Jemisin, and Erikson, and analyzed them for a few things. The paragraphs I pulled were descriptive -- no dialogue, no action scenes -- since I figured those would best represent the author's voice unmixed with characters' voices.

I looked at three key areas: 1) average sentence length, 2) adj/adv usage, and 3) Germanic vs Latinate word usage. (To be clear, I wasn't being exhaustive or even super academic. Just testing to see if I want to dig further. In the future I'll look at sentence structure and punctuation usage, among other things.)

Here's a visual rundown of how the numbers shook out:

[https://imgur.com/a/bnNAH2B](https://imgur.com/a/bnNAH2B)

Here's what I learned:

* Tolkien and Rothfuss are both super heavy on Germanic words. I think their word choice gives them a deliberate, poetic feel.
* On the other hand, where Tolkien uses tons of modifiers -- adjectives and adverbs -- Rothfuss keeps those to a minimum.
* Sanderson uses a comparatively high number of Latinate words. Like, outrageously high. At least, it seems that way until you realize how high our day-to-day usage of Latinates is in spoken English. I think this makes Sanderson's prose much more casual, which some like and others find unremarkable or even poor.
* Jemisin fell in the middle of the pack in terms of Latinates and modifiers. She has a distinct style from the others, but I think cracking her code will lie elsewhere in a different analysis.
* Erikson had the longest sentence length, with Sandersonian levels of Latinate words. I know the least about his writing out of the group, so I'm not sure yet what to make of it. Frustrating to a certain audience, I would assume?

I go into more detail, and read from a couple of the samples, [in this video](https://youtu.be/yGtVPRnFi_s). If you enjoy it and have other ideas for how to quantify prose style, let me know.

I absolutely fell in love with the book and picked up new ones as they came out. 

In 2005, around the time The Opal Deception came out, I started a little fan website for the book series as there wasn't anything particularly out there, and as a frequent MuggleNet visitor I wanted in on the action! I learned how to code and developed an interest in website design and development.

I forced my dad to take me to various Eoin Colfer signings, and I wrote him the odd letter and did my best keeping the site filled with news, and the forum filled with users and discussion. Over the years I've met Eoin a fair few times - [dat aging](https://i.imgur.com/3t4Hb9x.jpg).

As a kid growing up and going through school, I was originally wanting to go into journalism, however my interest in website design and development from managing the Artemis Fowl fansite convinced me to go to University to study a mixture of technology and business, and now I own my own business, developing websites for clients, along with graphic design and marketing!

Over the years I've been to book launch parties, signings, events and all sorts - but that pales in comparison to a fortnight ago. I found myself interviewing Eoin Colfer in a studio to talk about the new Fowl spin-off series - THE FOWL TWINS - and we've [just published the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8YsjaNv7Q0)! Even after all these years and challenges faced, this was somehow one of the most daunting yet exciting experiences of my life. I think I managed to keep reasonably cool but what you don't see in the video is me blanking and having to check notes after every question or so in the first 10 minutes of the interview!

Not only do I at least partially owe my career to the Artemis Fowl series & Eoin Colfer - but when I lost my dad completely out of the blue a good few years back, managing the website in my free time around working was one of the things that kept me going completely off the deep-end.

I know people the world over have gone on life journeys and experiences as a result of a book or series, but I just wanted to share mine.

1609163212.0,"James E. Gunn, 1923-2020","This Saturday, James E. Gunn, the last living Golden Age science fiction author (no, not the director), passed away of congestive heart failure at age 97.

I had the good fortune to take a couple of science fiction classes with Gunn at the University of Kansas a bit over a decade ago, and I can honestly say I wouldn't be the author I am today without his influence. He introduced me to countless classic authors I wouldn't have read otherwise, and exposed me to the fascinating history of science fiction and fantasy. In the first class I took with him, during the summer semester of my freshman year of college, I met the first girl I ever kissed (I was a late bloomer, don't judge me), as well as one of my closest lifelong friends, who I actually served as a groomsman for at his wedding a few years ago. (The three of us actually led a discussion group for China Mieville's *Perdido Street Station* and Iain M. Banks' *Consider Phlebas-* students took turns in groups leading discussions for each of the 25 books read for the class.)

Gunn's influence on my life was vastly disproportionate to the time I spent learning from him. I honestly don't know if I would have been the author I am today without his influence. I would be surprised if Gunn remembered me- it's been years since we've spoken, and I was just one more among countless thousands of students that he taught. I do have friends who were close to him, and the impact his loss has had on them is immense- Gunn was deeply beloved by those around him.

He frequently had stories of interacting with Heinlein, Asimov, and countless other speculative fiction greats. One of my favorite anecdotes he told our class involved him sitting with Phillip K. Dick at an award show. When he asked Dick what he'd been up to lately, Dick's response was ""Graffiti, mostly.""

Without Gunn, there wouldn't have been much of a study of science fiction and fantasy's history. In 1968, he founded the Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas, the first ever university program of its sort. It led to the establishment of science fiction courses and studies at universities around the world, many of which it directly helped establish. The Center for the Study of Science Fiction is still around today, and is also in charge of giving out the Campbell and Sturgeon Awards. Gunn also put together *The Road to Science Fiction*, a combination history of the genre/ anthology of representative short stories and excerpts for each era, dating all the way back to Gilgamesh. The Road to Science Fiction is absolutely a must-read for anyone studying the history of speculative fiction.

Gunn was a prolific science fiction writer over the years. He sold the first short story he ever wrote (which is kinda terrifying) in 1948, and continued putting out books and short stories for his entire life. He wrote 28 books and edited 18 during his career, and his most recent trilogy of novels came out over this last decade. His writing spans not only many decades, but many shifts in artistic tradition as well. Gunn didn't just stick to Golden Age style science fiction, but attempted (and usually succeeded) in writing in many of the various literary trends and movements that passed through the genre over the 20th century, including the New Wave and hard SF. One of his most notable works is *The Listeners,* the novel widely credited with inspiring SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Life, as well as Carl Sagan's *Contact.*

Another well-known aspect of it is that Generic Fantasy Dwarves usually live underground and in mountainous regions, in vast halls that were old before Generic Fantasy Elves sang their first poem about moonlight or stars or trees or bees or something boring like that. 

You may recognize this as an environment that is not ideal for growing barley. Of course, Generic Fantasy Dwarves could trade with Humans for barley in exchange for Superior Generic Fantasy Dwarven Craftmanship, but can you trust the produce of those shifty Humans? No you cannot! I mean, come on - they are basically round-eared, short-lived *Elves*, for Moradin's sake!

Also, as we all know, Generic Fantasy Dwarven kingdoms were vast and deep well before  Humans learned which end to poop out of, so Authentic Generic Fantasy Dwarven Beer cannot have originally relied on trade with humans. 

Now, do you know what crop is fairly well-suited to mountain soil? You guessed it, carrots - and they grow underground too, and they have a beard*, so basically they are honorary Generic Fantasy Dwarves themselves. 

And can you make something alcoholic out of them? [Of course!](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=carrot+wine&t=h_&ia=recipes)

All recipes I can find require to add extra sugar (carrots are somewhat sugary, but apparently not enough to easily get some serious fermentation going on their own); but Generic Fantasy Dwarves could obtain this sugar from beets, for example, that also grow underground and are more Generic Fantasy Dwarvish than bloody *barley*. 

So there you have it. I have made my case, and I think that it is pretty solid: Generic Fantasy Dwarven Beer is carrot wine.

-A pretty decent worldbuilding, the one needed for the storie but it could be expanded a lot.

-A lot of emotional moments without feeling like you're being manipulated by the author.

-A perfect hard magic system that regardless of being based of ancient chemistry, it doesn't feel like pseudoscience (Take a note, Sando) and it's pretty dynamic.

-Action packed battles where you don't know who's gonna win, even ""muggles"" have chances against alchemists or immortal monsters, it's not about who's stronger, it's about who have the better strategy.

-Phyloshical themes like what is a human, what is truth, what's the point of the war and things like that.

-Not medieval setting, don't get me wrong, I love medieval fantasy but having a breath of that kind of scenario is always good (and not very common in high fantasy).


**PLUS***

-The art of the manga is very unique, thank God it doesn't have the typical super slim anime style (or super muscular).

-The music of both adaptations is beautiful.


A negative point about the manga is the sense of humor of the author, maybe is too japanese for me and the most bothering thing is when the characters start joking in a serious moment but besides that, I can't complain about any other thing. I think this universe have a lot of potential to many stories and even being adapted by Hollywood to become the new Harry Potter (but a lot better) and I know there's already a japanese live action movie (and two more on the way) but this are fucking horrible.

What do you guys think? Have you ever read it or seen it one of the adaptations?",Fantasy

1630934481.0,"To Celebrate My Birthday, Have Some Free Kindle Progression Fantasy Books!","Hey all,

To celebrate my birthday, I'm running a free book promotion on a couple of my titles.

First is [**Sufficiently Advanced Magic**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XBFD7CB/), my most popular book and the first in my **Arcane Ascension** series. **Sufficiently Advanced Magic** is a JRPG inspired progression fantasy novel. Our protagonist, Corin Cadence, seeks to learn magic and ascend through a titanic tower to discover the fate of his brother, who disappeared into the tower five years earlier. The series has a mixture of magical academy content focusing on learning magic and dungeon crawling sections in the tower (and other dangerous locales). It takes place in the same setting as two of my other series, but this is the most popular place to start reading my books. If you enjoy JRPGs like **Final Fantasy**, **Fire Emblem**, **Trails**, **SaGa**, etc. you might like this one.

&#x200B;

[Sufficiently Advanced Magic](https://preview.redd.it/tqfqbbvhvvl71.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=421a5ae8803cec7424feadd3a95abb4dc6fbd40c)

&#x200B;

The next free title is [**How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F3RTTKM/), my comedic love letter to games like **Zelda** and **Dragon Quest**. In this world, there is a cycle: every hundred years the Demon King rises and seeks to conquer the world. A hundred years thereafter, the Hero is reborn and defeats the Demon King. Yui Shaw is born into a world under the Demon King's onslaught - and she's not willing to wait for a legendary Hero to rise. She'll find a way to win without the power of prophecy. This is much more of a parody than my other books, and it's also a novella, whereas **Sufficiently Advanced Magic** is a door stopper-length novel. So, if you want a quicker taste of my style before jumping into massive works, this is a good option.

I'll also quickly note that [**Six Sacred Swords**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NKBSZGF/) is currently under Prime Reading, and thus, available free for people with Prime Reading. That's not a special thing for today, but it's another potentially free book, so I figured it was still worth mentioning. This one is more of a flashy action-focused story with a protagonist that is powerful from the start. Like my other books, it's heavily inspired by JRPGs, but this one leans more into the action RPG style - think **Ys** or **Tales**. If you like sword-wielding heroes, talking swords, and bibliophile dragons, consider checking this one out. Note that this is not free for everyone - this on is specifically a Prime Reading deal.

1357751993.0,I'm fantasy author Patrick Rothfuss - AMA,"Heya everybody, I'm Patrick Rothfuss.

I'm a fantasy author.

I'm a father. My son is three.

[I have a show about writing on Felicia Day's Youtube Channel: Geek and Sundry](http://geekandsundry.com/)

I also run a [charity called Worldbuilders.](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2012/11/worldbuilders-2012/) Over the last four years we've raised over 1.5 million dollars for Heifer International.

[Here are some guidelines based off the Machine Gun Q&A sessions I run on my blog.](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/category/machine-gun-qa/)

1. You can ask any question.

2. Bite-sized questions are best. I'd rather answer 80 questions instead of spending all my time writing up 3-4 long, detailed answers and having to ignore everyone else as a result.

3. One question per comment is best. It's just simpler and easier that way. It's going to be hard for me to write a carefully structured essay answering your five-part question.

4. I reserve the right to lie, make jokes, or ignore your question.

  4b. If I ignore your question, it’s not because I hate you. It’s probably just because I don’t have anything witty to say on the subject.

5. I reserve the right to be honest, snarky, or flippant. Either consecutively or concurrently.

6. I won’t answer spoiler-ish questions about the books.

**I will be back at 8PM Central to answer questions.**


**[Edit at 10:15 PM:] Merciful Buddha. I thought I was getting to the end of the list, when it turns out I was just getting to the end of the first 500 comments. I'll stop back tomorrow and take another quick poke through things, and answer a few more questions. But for now, I've used up all my words. I need to get a little nap in, then do some more writing tonight. Thanks for a great time everybody.**

1699287554.0,Fantasy Romance is STILL Fantasy,"I feel like there has been SO MUCH pretentiousness from fantasy fans about fantasy romance and goddamn that shit is annoying. Just because the idea of sex or sexual desire in fantasy novels scares you, doesn't mean it is not real fantasy.

Average writing in a book does not make it not fantasy, hell, Sanderson is one of the most successful fantasy writers of our generation and his writing is no Tolkien thats for sure (as a massive Sanderson fan). There are plenty of male authors that constantly write descriptions of womens boobs, clothes, and figures as well as dudes wanting to have sex with every woman they see and somehow that is all fine since its from a man (Robert Jordan, Brent Weeks, Jim Butcher -- I could give so many examples but you know what many books I am talking about). But god forbid a woman wants to have sex and displays sexual desire and it is all ""shitty writing"" and ""no world building"" since the world and magic system isn't info dumped on you for 15 pages straight.

Thank a little more critically why you are so quick to dismiss books like Fourth Wing or ACOTAR as valid fantasy. **If you don't like it, cool -- no one is forcing you to read it.** Things like booktok have quote literally made hundreds of thousands of people pick up books and fantasy because they promote accessible writing. Just because you didn't do your research and now are frazzled reading sexual desire from a woman doesn't mean it is not fantasy. Just because a book is FUN, does not mean its not real fantasy.

Edit: Lots of the comments seem to come from people who have not read any fantasy romance and think it ONLY sex in a fantasy setting which is not the case. Some are like that but the majority of ones that are popular and that I have read are not. Fantasy genre has evolved from farm boy searches for magical object but somehow fantasy romance can't be included? When you mention what you think fantasy romance is, give an example of that, if that does not apply to all fantasy romance novels -- perhaps it is not a monolith like you think!

*You can disagree but the fact is that books that are popular with male audiences are critically acclaimed real fantasy even if they devote the same amount of page time to romance but books popular with female audiences are dismissed as romance or guilty pleasures even if they evoke the same level of emotion from people.* 

If you have a preference against romance, grim dark, etc, do your due diligence and read a review or two to see if it is the right fit for you or not -- and don't blame it on the people who enjoy the books.",Fantasy
1617463384.0,Just finished the Realm of the Elderlings saga. You can't convince me that Robin Hobb isn't the greatest living fantasy writer right now,"
Just finished Assassin’s Fate, the final book in Robin Hobb’s 16-book Realm of the Elderlings saga. To say that I’m floored would be understating it. Pretty convinced that I just read the greatest fantasy ever written and it’ll be hard for anything in the genre to top it. I’m not an emotional person but holy shit I feel like my heart has been ripped out of my chest.


I won’t go too much into the story or characters but just more wanted to share my feelings. Really feeling like I just spent a lifetime with these people, these characters that came to mean so much to me.


Has anyone achieved this kind of depth, poignancy and complexity when it comes to characters in fantasy? I really can’t think of another series or standalone novel that has. Following Fitz’s journey from a child to an old man was a transcendent experience. I felt like I lived his entire lifetime with him, with every single high and low – and boy, there are so, so, so many crushing lows.


I could spend pages talking about the growth in characters like Fitz, the Fool, Malta, Wintrow, etc etc but I think it’s better to experience it for yourself. The worldbuilding is incredible as well, especially because just how low-key and inconspicuous it is. It just slowly grows organically over each book until the Five Duchies feel like one of the most well-realized settings in the genre.


Hobb’s prose is amazing throughout. It’s not showy, but it has an evocative melancholy and simple elegance to it. Almost fairy-tale like at times, very warm and comforting.


But above all, it’s the people that really make this saga. This is the very definition of “character-driven” storytelling. There’s no plot and no story without the decisions and actions taken by these characters, and consequences are wide and far-reaching. The books aren’t always easy reads – Hobb takes her characters through the emotional and mental wringer again and again and again. But that’s what’s most remarkable about it. It’s a look at just how much you can take at what life throws at you and still keep going.


Just an absolute masterclass in storytelling and writing. I would put RotE up there with some of the best literary classics I’ve read. ",Fantasy
1617203645.0,"I decided to check out Unsouled (book one of the Cradle series) by Will Wight on a whim, and six days later I've binged all eight books published so far.","I've been trying to find a decent xianxia series for a while now. Already found some really good wuxia-level stories like The Breaker, Legend of the Northern Blade and Blood and Steel, but xianxia always seemed to centre around really unlikeable protagonists in a story that made no sense whatsoever.

Enter Will Wight's Cradle series. The first book was just 89 cents on amazon, and 294 pages, so it thought it worth checking out, especially with the myriad positive reviews I'd come across. I thought I'd read it and see if I wanted to add the rest of the series to my list.

It SUCKED ME IN. I read the first book. Then I read the second book. Then I realised I was screwed. Goodbye all my plans for the week.

Don't get me wrong, it's not High Literature. And while funny it's no Pratchett.

What it is, is pure literary cocaine. I couldn't stop. I had to find out what happened next. Wight grabbed me by the scalp and shoved my face through the screen. Yes, the power fantasy aspect can get a bit exhausting, especially when binging, but it becomes a lot more tolerable thanks to the fact that the male protagonist isn't an unlikeable jerk like so many xianxia protagonists. He's a really sweet guy who simply suffers from an unfortunate case of resting ""I will murder you as a warning to your family"" face, which combined with his imposing build gives entirely the wrong impression to people he meets for the first time.

And the female protagonist is allowed to shine! Repeatedly! Even up to the latest published book! This ain't no case of ""Sakura falls hopelessly behind Naruto and Sasuke."" As a matter of fact she's way stronger than the male protagonist in the beginning, and while he does a lot of catching up she's still a notch above him, and Wight shows it to us too.

Also no harem! Nary a hint. Which I don't mind telling you is mighty refreshing.

There's a lot more I could mention, but right now my eyes are hurting and I really need some sunlight, so I'll finish by telling you that one of the male protagonist's mentor figures is a giant firebreathing kung fu turtle. If you don't find that appealing then I don't know what to say.

1613580909.0,Why are most mothers in fantasy dead or absent?,"I remember George R. R. Martin saying he created Catelyn Tully because he noticed that if the characters in most fantasy stories weren't complete orphans their mothers were dead or absent. He didn't want to follow that cliché and he made a strong mother character that has a prominent role in the story. 

Then I noticed that he was right: in most cases the mother is not present in the story. She is either dead before the story starts or dies before the second act. In best case she is kidnapped (Percy Jackson uses this) and the hero has to save her. And in a rare case the mother doesn't care about her child and abandons her/him (Once Upon a Time loves parental abandonment trope very much). Other than that when the hero speaks of her/his parents, she/he mostly talks about the dad and the dad often plays an important role in the story. The mum is rarely mentioned.

Why does this happen? Do fantasy writers actually dislike mother characters?

1626234377.0,Pouting and sulking in The Wheel of Time. Childish behaviors in female characters- data and observations.,"Did I probably spend way too much time on this weirdly specific topic? Yup.

Firstly, I LOVE this series, so this is definitely not meant to be a ""Robert Jordan can't write women"" post. Several of the women are some of my favorite characters ever. That being said, I have issues with some of the gendered stuff (as most people do) and one of the things I noticed while reading was that Jordan repeated certain expressions a lot; an example of this being the pouting and sulking. These are not completely exclusive to children of course, but when I think of ""pouting"" I imagine a toddler sticking their lower lip out and preparing to throw a tantrum or being childishly upset and ""sulking"" is usually an immature/childish descriptor, as opposed to ""annoyed"" or ""angry."" I've personally only ever heard someone use the word ""sulking"" in regards to children. If you Google Image these words it's photos of children. 

So, because I had already noticed this while reading, I searched all 14 books on my Kindle for every instance of pouting and sulking. I'm sure there are other similar descriptors I could do this for, but this will be long enough as it is. 

Yes, I'm listing them all because I assumed some people might try saying I'm exaggerating or making too much out of it.

***I actually want to highlight this particular little exchange because Jordan does this thing a lot:***

&gt;*Wrapping her arms around herself, Elayne scowled. “Stop sulking, sister,” Aviendha said. She pointed down to one of the stableyards... The familiar vertical slash of light appeared in the stableyard and rotated into a hole in the air ten feet tall and as wide. Elayne scowled down at Reanne’s head. She was *not* sulking.*

***One character will tell another to stop sulking and that character will internally  have a petulant defensive reaction like ""I'm not sulking!"" which strikes me as  very childish/immature. Also, the text says Elayne ""scowled"" but Aviendha calls it ""sulking"" which seems like a way to diminish valid anger, and this type of interaction happens several times over the series.***

- Carlinya (""“Don’t sulk, Carlinya."")
- Tiana (""made her look sulky."")

***I want to highlight this bit as well. Egwene herself recognizes that her very valid frustration/anger might be dismissed as childish sulking.

Sulking: 0


##**CONCLUSIONS:**

31 counts of pouting, of which only 1 is directly male. 

74 counts of sulking, of which 13 are male, 2 of which are a small boy. 

1. It appears that for Jordan, or in the way Jordan was choosing to write these characters in this world, mannerisms that we would label as childish like pouting and sulking are very *female* mannerisms. 

2. A couple other instances of very childish behavior is a mention of Nynaeve's ""tantrums"" and Elayne thinking she might stick her tongue out. These are things we might associate with a five year old and they're being associated with a grown woman, including a grown woman who has a legitimate anger block in her magic ability. 

3. This is a Jordan-ism. When Sanderson takes over there are only 4 mentions of these expressions in all three books, and I've yet to encounter another author who writes grown women as pouting and sulking so much. 

4. Jordan goes out of his way to remind you repeatedly that certain characters pout and sulk, such as Amathera and Alanna. For Amathera it's a bit confusing as he has her enslaved and tortured and mind-raped, then continues to describe them as pouting like a little girl. This really bothers me, as it just felt completely unecessary; why portray a very minor character in such a way, what's the point? Furthermore, her enslavement and PTSD is not even dealt with in a serious manner at all.... she is just portrayed as a bad leader and annoying person, then a pouting freed slave who pouts a lot. Just... why?

5. I'm not going to go into it here, but I feel I must also point out that quite a few women get spanked in this series, which is arguably another kind of infantilization. When you combine that with all the pouting and sulking... it's definitely something to think about.

1628866973.0,Tom Bombadil - Who is he really?,"It’s a pretty astounding fact that Professor Tolkien created (approximately) 54,960 years of history between the creation of Arda and the destruction of the One Ring, and yet his fictional chronology is about as clear and compelling as our own 5000 years of real world history. It’s astounding that Tolkien created dozens of races to live in hundreds of locations over thousands of years, and yet it all fits together (for the most part) into one credible, consistent, and compatible Legendarium. It feels like Tolkien created a million pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and over the course of his lifetime, he put these pieces together and constructed one vast picture. However, not *every* piece of this puzzle fits. Peppered throughout the Legendarium there are a small number of enigmas, which add their own unique, yet utterly mysterious flavour, to Tolkien’s world. So let's delve into the most enigmatic enigma of them all – Tom Bombadil.

Now the first thing to say about Tom, is that he's a being of many names. But amongst them all, there is one constant.

The dude is old. Very old. To the Rohirric speaking Men, Tom is called Orald, which is an Old English word meaning ‘ancient’. To the Dwarves Tom is known as Forn, which is an Old Norse name that also pertains to ‘ancient days’. And to the Sindarin speaking Elves and the Dúnedain, he is known as Iarwain Ben-adar, which literally means ‘old young and fatherless.’

Now these revealing names immediately imply that Tom Bombadil may be one of the Ainur, as they are the oldest living things in the Legendarium, and technically, as offspring of Ilúvatar’s *thought*, they could all be considered fatherless. But I worry that this classification may be too simplistic for such an enigma. And being an Ainu does not even explain Tom’s most enigmatic traits.

So I guess the absolute simplest theory of Bombadil’s origin is that he’s a Maia. This explains his age and his power, and it doesn’t raise too many follow up questions, as Tolkien never gave us an exhaustive list of all the Maiar in his Legendarium. But being a Maia doesn’t explain everything.

Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of Tom is that the One Ring appears to have no effect on him. He takes it from Frodo, puts it on his finger, and yet nothing happens. He’s not corrupted, and he doesn’t turn invisible. And to be honest, there’s no way that this immunity to corruption is a Maia power. Because of course, loads of Maiar have been corrupted over the Ages, including Sauron himself, and we know that Gandalf (who is kind of a Maia) greatly fears the Ring’s corruption. Also if Tom is a Maia, then he wouldn’t be the oldest being in Middle-earth. Various members of the Valar including Manwë, Ulmo, Aulë, and of course Melkor, all existed in Arda before the Maiar were “\[drawn\] *unto them*”.

Now this has led to some theories that Tom (and by extension Goldberry) may be two of the Valar living in Middle-earth in disguise, but I don’t believe this is possible. There are only six married couples amongst the Valar, and none of them seem to have anything in common with Tom and Goldberry. Once upon a time I believed that Tom might be Oromë, and Goldberry might be his wife Vana. But this makes no sense. Oromë is a hunter of evil things, so why then would there be Barrow-wights living right on his doorstep? It’s also been suggested that Tom and Goldberry might be Aulë and Yavanna, but again this theory falls flat. If there’s one thing that can be confidently said about Goldberry, it’s that she is in some way connected with water, rivers and rain. She is after all the daughter of the River-woman, but the only Vala with any watery association is Ulmo, and he’s an unmarried male.

Now I’ve also seen it speculated that instead of being an Ainu, perhaps Tom Bombadil could potentially be Eru Ilúvatar himself in corporeal form. But honestly I don’t think this is likely either. I feel it somewhat cheapens Eru. And Tolkien himself agreed. When asked about the relationship between Bombadil and God, Tolkien replied, “*I really do think you are being too serious, besides missing the point.”*

So having expanded the list of things that Tom Bombadil is *not*, I suppose we should also take a look at what Tolkien actually *does* tell us about the character. We’re told that Tom is the “*Master of wood, water, and hill”,* and his interactions with Old Man Willow and the Barrow-wights suggests that he has some significant degree of power within his own realm. However the nature of this power is never stated. And if Tom truly has lived in the woods of Middle-earth since the very beginning, then he would have observed a remarkable diminishing of his realm over the years. At his own Council in Rivendell, Elrond explains that there was once a time *“when a squirrel could carry a nut from tree to tree from Rivendell to the Great Sea,""* which seems to state that western Middle-earth was once one huge forest. But as we know, by the Third Age this is no longer the case, and so if Tom Bombadil really is the *“Master of wood”,*then by the time of The Lord of the Rings, most of his realm has vanished. Does this mean his power is diminished too? And before we can even begin to answer that question, we first need to examine how much power does Tom actually have?

Because, when I first read *Fellowship of the Ring* I imagined that Tom Bombadil must be some sort of all-powerful being if he’s able to resist the power of the Ring. I assumed for this reason that he was more powerful than even Sauron. But I no longer think this is true. Although it’s very compelling to imagine Tom as having god-like powers and being the most powerful character in the story, I don’t believe this is what Tolkien intended. When Tom put the Ring on his finger, I don’t think he was outmatching Sauron’s power, I think he simply lacked the traits of ambition and possessive desire that the Ring targets in its victims. Again in the *Council of Elrond,* Gandalf argues against an elf called Erestor who suggested that Tom Bombadil *“has a power over the Ring”,* but instead Gandalf stated *“I should not put it so…Say rather that the Ring has no power over him. He is his own master. But he cannot alter the Ring itself, nor break its power over others.”* And later Gandalf goes on to say, *“could that power*\[Sauron\] *be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not. I think that in the end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall…*\[The\] p*ower to defy our Enemy is not in him.”* And furthermore, in Letter 144 Tolkien himself wrote, *“ultimately only the victory of the West will allow Bombadil to continue, or even to survive. Nothing would be left for him in the world of Sauron.”* So all of this suggests that although Tom does have significant power in his little corner of the world, he is not the all-powerful being that we sometimes imagine him to be.

So the question remains, why does Tom Bombadil even exist? I suppose an out of universe answer might simply be that Tolkien liked the name. His son Michael supposedly had a Dutch doll that was called Tom Bombadil, and so perhaps Tolkien simply included Tom as nothing more than a cameo for his son. However from an in-universe perspective, I think that the answer is a little more complex. Tom seems to represent a personification of peace and pacifism, and so perhaps he was created for this very purpose by Eru Ilúvatar way back in the beginning. Peace and natural woodland are things that Tolkien himself valued very highly, and so perhaps he wrote Tom to embody these virtues. However, it’s interesting to note that although both Gandalf and Elrond agree that Tom is a benevolent being, they both know that his pacifism alone will not be enough to prevent the spread of evil. Although the world needs pacifists like Tom, it also needs people like Frodo, and Aragorn, and Sam who are willing to go the distance see things through to their end. In 20th Century Europe, a century marked by generations of war, this may have been a topical theme for someone like Tolkien. He detested violence, and yet he was no pacifist.

So in conclusion, I feel like it might be a little disappointing for me to end this post with the statement, I don’t know, but I’m afraid that is the bottom line. In letter 174, Tolkien himself wrote *“as a story, I think it is good that there should be a lot of things unexplained…And even in a mythical Age there must be some enigmas, as there always are.”* So at the end of the day, I feel that Tolkien added these enigmas to his Legendarium on purpose, because not every facet of Middle-earth should be explained. There will always be mysteries, and we need to make peace with that. I believe it’s what Tolkien intended.

Anyway guys, thanks very much for reading this long post; as some of you may know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos all about Professor Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. I've just started a brand new weekly series all about the Elves of the First Age. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

1644942294.0,Sabriel by Garth Nix: an enchanting tale about death and new beginnings,"Talking cat, magic bells, abandoned castles, a journey into an old kingdom, the eerie feeling of impending darkness. All woven by beautiful charming language which gives the whole novel the feeling of a fairy tale, or of a waking dream being imagined just before the all-consuming sleep.

Sabriel is the best fantasy novel I read in more than a year. This was my first book by Garth Nix and I was not expecting to like his writing so much. Maybe it's because I've been living under a rock, but by coincidence, I had not seen any posts or commentaries about it here before I start reading it. Either way, I'm glad that I started because I was hooked by the writing style from the beginning.  


>You may call me Mogget. As to what I am, I was once many things, but now I am only several.

The book tells the story of Sabriel and her journey into the Old Kingdom, a place filled with magic and wonders and ruins where dormant evils await in shallow graves. In her mind, she carries the words of the ever-changing book of the dead, and on her body, a sword and seven bells of seven sizes, each if rang true will carry its sound even beyond life. Along this journey, the reader will experience moments of wonder, moments of apprehension, and moments of fear. All to answer if Sabriel is capable of growing to the needs of her dire quest.  


>Going through the arch, from mud into snow, from bright sun into the pallid luminescence of a snowfall, from her past into her future.

1704556088.0,Jaime Lannister vs. Hermione Granger: When George R.R. Martin decided to set the record straight.,"Back in the Spring of 2010 a website (suvudu) ran a ""March Madness"" style bracket of popular fantasy characters to determine which was the most powerful, as voted on by readers. Somehow Martin's **Jaime Lannister** ended up facing off against Rowling's **Hermione Granger** early on in the voting. For flavor's sake, one of the site's editors wrote what they thought would happen if such a fight occurred, and decided that in such a scenario Granger, with her magic, would easily defeat Lannister. They wrote that despite the power of his Valyrian steel sword, Granger could simply make him levitate upside down, and distract him with birds, and thus easily defeat the Kingslayer.

GRRM disagreed. The following was his response (some ASOIAF spoilers).

&#x200B;

>No, no.  
>  
>Jaime does not actually own a Valyrian steel sword. The blade he used to kill King Aerys is common castle-forged steel, gilded to match his golden armor. But he can certainly get hold of a Valyrian blade for the fight — Widow’s Wail, the twin to Oathkeeper, both made when his father had Ice melted down and reforged. Widow’s Wail went to Joffrey, but we all know how that turned out. Now it belongs to Tommen, but the kid’s not old enough to use it.  
>  
>A sword is not enough, though. This duel is life and death. Jaime is not likely to prance into that clearing smiling and clad only in cloth. He’ll armor himself before the match. His gilded plate-and-mail (this is not a fit occasion for the white of the Kingsguard), a crimson cloak, and a shield strapped to his right arm and emblazoned with the lion of Lannister. And of course he will have a helm. Knights who enter battle without one are soon dead. He can smile at Hermione before the match, then lower his visor. The helm, of course, would be fashioned in the shape of a maned lion. (Oddly enough, the Lannister arms look a lot like those of Gryffindor, which might give Hermione a moment’s pause).  
>  
>He’s not going to waste time and effort swatting at birds with his sword, either. He’s encased in gilded steel. What are they going to do, crap on him? He’ll rush right through the birds, and go straight for Hermione. A sword is not a knight’s only weapon. While she’s watching the blade, he will slam his shield right into her face, knock her off her feet. Let her try and mumble those spells with a mouthful of broken teeth.  
>  
>And if somehow Granger does get off that spell (cheating, really) and turn him upside down, Jaime is more likely to undo the straps on his shield and fling it at her head then to hang there meekly waiting to die.  
>  
>But hey, let’s say everything goes the way your “experts” say it will, and Hermione wins. Sad to say, she will not live long to enjoy her victory. Sometime very soon, when she least expects it, a “boy” she does not know will bump up against her in the corridors of Hogwarts… and suddenly she’ll find a dagger sliding through her ribs, right into her heart. “A Lannister always pays his debts,” Tyrion will say, as he slips back into the shadows.

> ""I did begin a story placed about 100 years after the Downfall, but it proved both sinister and depressing. Since we are dealing with Men, it is inevitable that we should be concerned with the most regrettable feature of their nature: their quick satiety with good. So that the people of Gondor in times of peace, justice and prosperity, would become discontented and restless — while the dynasts descended from Aragorn would become just kings and governors — like Denethor or worse.

1589294861.0,"Dear author-hopefuls of r/Fantasy, there is something you really need to know: Writing is not a talent. It is a skill.","Most of this little monologue is copied and pasted from my response to a post by [u/ProbablyInterned](https://www.reddit.com/u/ProbablyInterned/), who was lamenting their lack of ability compared to the likes of Joe Abercombie. I've seen a good number of such comments and fears discussed in my time here on r/Fantasy, and I wanted to address them with a simple fact I think a lot of author-hopefuls and struggling writers really, *really* need to understand:

**Writing is not a talent. It is a** ***skill.***

What I mean by that is that is--while having a talent for writing is certainly helpful--it is not something you are born being as good at as you will ever be. It is *completely natural* to compare your style and prose and narrative to your favorite authors, but you need to remember that the likes of GRRM, Robert Jordan, Joe Abercrombie, Michael J. Sullivan, Brent Weeks, Robin Hobb, etc.... they have all written a lot--I mean a LOT--of books, and have undoubtedly surpassed the 10,000 hour master mark and then some. Their writings have developed and adapted, improved and tempered themselves over time.

Just like yours can and will.

Don't get me wrong. Your first attempt(s) is/are likely to be complete trash. Thing is: that's 100% ok. Personally my first book was so garbage the only single person who ever finished it was my father. I ended up setting it aside for more than 10 years, wrote a completely different story, and then came back to it. With rewriting, that book became the single biggest seller I have to date.

It's totally fine to feel like you're nothing compared to the likes of Joe Abercrombie and his ilk. Chances are you *are* nothing, but you are only nothing ***right now***. With patience, passion, and a lot of practice, you could very well outstrip a few, a lot, or maybe even every author out there one day. You don't know, and you never will unless you try.

Write. Just do it. Accept that it may/will probably be complete trash. If it's not, awesome. If it is, that's awesome too, because you have dozens and dozens of hours of practice now.

Do not let the fear of failing something prevent you from attempting it. You are not a failed writer if you fail at writing a good story. You are a failed writer only when you stop trying to make the next project that much better.

Good luck, kick ass, and welcome to the immensely fun world of fantasy and writing :)

1711021311.0,"Le Guin talks about the ""twist"" of LOTR's characters and themes","From the book Language of the Night:

>  Critics have been hard on Tolkien for his ""simplisticness,"" his division of the inhabitants of Middle Earth into the good people and the evil people. And indeed he does this, and his good people tend to be entirely good, though with endearing frailties, while his Orcs and other villains are altogether nasty. But all this is a judgment by daylight ethics, by conventional standards of virtue and vice. When you look at the story as a psychic journey, you see something quite different, and very strange. You see then a group of bright figures, each one with its black shadow. Against the Elves, the Orcs. Against Aragorn, the Black Rider. Against Gandalf, Saruman. And above all, against Frodo, Gollum. Against him--and with him.  
>  
>  It is truly complex, because both the figures are clearly doubled. Sam is, in part, Frodo's shadow, his ""inferior"" part. Gollum is two people, too, in a more direct, schizophrenic sense; he's always talking to himself, Slinker talking to Stinker, Sam calls it. Sam understands Gollum very well, though he won't admit it and won't accept Gollum as Frodo does, letting Gollum be their guide, trusting him. Frodo and Gollum are not only both hobbits; they are the same person--and Frodo knows it. Frodo and Sam are the bright side, Smeagol-Gollum the shadow side. In the end Sam and Smeagol, the lesser figures, drop away, and all that is left is Frodo and Gollum, at the end of the long quest. And it is Frodo the good who fails, who at the last moment claims the Ring of Power for himself; and it is Gollum the evil who achieves the quest, destroying the Ring, and himself with it. The Ring, the archetype of the Integrative Function, the creative-destructive, returns to the volcano, the eternal source of creation and destruction, the primal fire. When you look at it that way, can you call it a simple story? I suppose so. Oedipus Rex is a fairly simple story, too. But it is not simplistic. It is the kind of story that can be told only by one who has turned and faced his shadow and looked into the dark.

1596625005.0,"A challenge, a plea: Don't recommend Malazan or Sanderson, I dare you!","Before your hackles rise into orbit, hear me out!

Readers of r/fantasy will be well aware of the existence of Malazan and Sanderson's flotilla of books, and also aware of their popularity, and tendency to pop up in recommendation threads like mushrooms after rain. We joke about it, but also people counter with the argument that Malazan *does* have pirates, or Stormlight *does* have romance, etc etc. 

And you know what? This is true. Moreover Erickson and Sanderson are not bad, perhaps they are even great writers in the fantasy genre. But you know what else is great? Pizza.

Imagine, if you will, someone asks for a food recommendation, they want something with mushrooms. 

""How about a mushroom pizza?"" you say. ""After all, pizza is great, I could eat it all the time, and pizza has mushrooms on it.""

Then, someone asks for a recipes with smoked meat. ""Have you considered a pepperoni pizza?"" you ask. ""Or a ham pizza? If you're feeling cheeky, you can get some pineapple on it! Pizza is great, it's my favourite meal in the world."" The beauty of pizza, is that whatever someone wants, it's probably wound up on a pizza at some point. Plus, you get all that sauce and cheese. 

Sanderson and Malazan are the pizza of r/fantasy. Everybody knows about them. Almost everyone has tried them. They have all kinds of ingredients in them. But you probably don't need to recommend pizza; everyone knows about it and will eat it if they feel like it. And whilst you can put just about anything on-a-pizza/in-an-Erickson/Sanderson book, at the end of the day, it's still *primarily* going to be a pizza/Erickson/Sanderson book.

But what about a chicken tagine? Or some dukbokki? Or [that weird cheese with worms in it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casu_marzu)? Why don't we recommend those? Most people haven't tried them, may not even know about them. Also, if someone is after some cheese with worms in it (And who isn't in this crazy mixed up world?), why would you recommend a blue cheese pizza that a moth landed on? 

I feel like when we consistently recommend the same books, especially when they may only tangentially be related to the request, we crowd out other recommendations. This is compounded when these recommendations get tonnes of upvotes from people that love the books (and that's fine! Ain't nothing wrong with loving Deadhouse Gates, or The Alloy of Law or whatever! This is not a criticism of your favourite author/s!).

And if, you know, Malazan or Sanderson books are the only recommendation you can think of, when someone asks for a romance novel, or mythic feel etc, **maybe instead of *making* recommendations you should *take* some, and broaden your fantasy horizons a little**. 

There is a staggering array of food out there that makes the restaurant at the start of *Spirited Away* look like a McDonalds. Why would we keep heading back to pizza, when there is so much more to sample? Let's challenge ourselves and others to mix it up a bit, rather than sending them back to Dominos.

1617315195.0,J.R.R. Tolkien novel sales pass 600 million,"HarperCollins [has released updated sales figures](https://twitter.com/theoneringnet/status/1377738038755930112) for J.R.R. Tolkien's books, acquired by Tolkien fansite TheOneRing. These sales figures have been unified in English for the first time because News Corp., which already owns HarperCollins (Tolkien's British publishers), has also acquired Houghton Mifflin, Tolkien's American publishers.

The figures indicate that sales of Tolkien's books have surpassed 600 million. Counting Tolkien's book sales have been notoriously difficult due to poor accounting, legions of unauthorised overseas editions and even pirate editions of the book being sold in the United States (most famously the Ace Books edition of 1965, which sparked an international outcry and helped catapult Tolkien to greater fame and success in the States), so even this is a conservative figure.

Sales of 600 million would put Tolkien comfortably in the top ten selling authors of fiction of all time, although (contrary to some reports) nowhere near the top. William Shakespeare's plays have sold over 4 billion copies, whilst Agatha Christie's novels have sold at least 2 billion and possibly closer to 4 billion copies. From there it's a steeper drop to Barbara Cartland, who has sold around 750 million copies of her romance novels, just ahead of Danielle Steel on an estimated 700 million. Harold Robbins and Georges Simenon are around 700 million apiece as well.

Tolkien's sales put him at approximate parity with Enid Blyton, Sidney Sheldon and J.K. Rowling, who are all between 500 and 700 million in sales, and comfortably ahead of the likes of Dr. Seuss, Leo Tolstoy, Jackie Collins, Dean Koontz and Stephen King. Tolkien's friend C.S. Lewis can ""only"" muster 200 million sales of his books (mostly the **Narnia** series).

However, although Tolkien may not be the biggest-selling novelist of all time, he *may* have the biggest-selling individual novel. The overwhelming majority of Tolkien's book sales come from *The Lord of the Rings*, which across all editions and both the three and one-volume versions of the text has sold almost half a billion copies. *The Hobbit* has sold over 100 million copies. The combined sales of all of Tolkien's other books, although still respectable, fall well short of those figures.

Among contemporary and recent fantasy authors, George R.R. Martin, Sir Terry Pratchett and Robert Jordan have achieved just short of 100 million sales apiece, whilst Brandon Sanderson has sold around 30 million copies of his novels and Patrick Rothfuss roughly half that.

**ETA:** The One Ring has clarified their report as an ""April Fool's"" gag, a bit of a non-sequitur one since the figures are actually fully credible (if anything, on the conservative) side of things: Tolkien had sold over 400 million books by 2001, so an additional 200 million sales in twenty years, a period when Tolkien's popularity exploded beyond all recognition due to the success of the films (and HarperCollins were attributing a 50 million boost in sales as early as 2003), is pretty easy to believe.",Fantasy
1657935769.0,"So, I just finished reading The Way Of Kings By Brandon Sanderson. WOW.","The only other Book I read by Sanderson was The Final Empire and I thoroughly enjoyed it. So coming into The Way of Kings I thought I had a good indication on what to expect. I was wrong.  The first thing that stood out to me was the world building in this book. It was so well realized compared to The Final Empire. Just how much detail went into this world was astounding.     The magic was very interesting. I really thought that Sanderson did a great job creating Characters with different voices. Kaladin, Dalinar, Adolin, Shallan, Wit, and Jasnah just to name a few. They all had their own unique voice.  I would be lying if I didn’t say that Kaladin wasn’t my favorite I have a soft spot for unexpectedly strong leaders. Sanderson also made me enjoy the flashback chapters. I’ve never been a big fan of flash back chapters. But the ones in this book really felt like they were important and not just written for the sake of word count. Even though it was a 1,000 page book it didn’t feel like that at all. I was worried a little because Stormlight is a pillar in the community and is beloved by so many people and I was thinking that what if it doesn’t click for me. That wasn’t the case I’m a huge fan . The interludes was another part that I looked forward to. Even though we didn’t spend that much time with Szeth I felt like he was a in the book more than he actually was. His arc was one of my favorite parts. 

I’m a bit sad that I didn’t get Sanderson’s kickstarter, I didn’t want to invest $200+ for a author I wasn’t fully sure I would like his writing. Hindsight is 20/20.

Back in 1984 my mother filed for custody of my brother and I, and lost. Rather than give us back she took us and ran. We lived under assumed names for about a year, but eventually were caught.

My constant companion during that crazy year, and the worse that followed, was fantasy. The Chronicles of Prydain. The Hobbit. Narnia. Eventually Dragonlance, and Lord of the Rings. Dark Sun and Shadowrun and Forgotten Realms. The Deathgate Cycle. Tad Williams.

I always had my nose buried in a book. I always read something. No matter how chaotic the world got, or how little control I had over my life there was always fantasy. Some world I could lose myself in, with its own rules. A world where the protagonist could grow, and seize control of their own destiny the way I wanted to.

I don't know what would have happened to me if I hadn't had reading during that turbulent time. It certainly set the tone for my life since. I became a writer, and a game master, and eventually a full time author.

I owe all of that to fantasy. To the imagination of all the wonderful minds that came before. So thank you Margaret Weis, and Tracy Hickman. Thank you Robin Hobb, and C.S. Lewis. Thank you Tolkien. 

Millions and millions of us found our way through the darkness, and into the light, because you showed us the way.

If you're one of the kids just starting this journey, and still lost in those turbulent times, then draw strength from Sturm, and Drizzt, and Gandalf, and whoever else gives you the strength to keep aspiring to be the best version of you.

1596684063.0,"I just read Mistborn, and man was it fantastic","I've never really been into Fantasy besides basic stuff like Harry Potter or Percy Jackson. My Lord of the Rings obsessed friends forced me to watch all the movies, and I got halfway through Dune before I stopped reading it - I just didn't really enjoy either. But I've wanted to get out of my reading comfort zone this year and try some fantasy, and upon hearing good things about it, I bought the Mistborn trilogy.

Holy crap, guys. You all weren't kidding about Brando Sando. The trilogy was amazing. And I finally found a high fantasy that I actually like!

I thought the first book was just okay - not bad, but nowhere near as good as people were claiming - but a pretty straightforward 'plucky rebels fight the dark lord' story you've seen a million times. I'm not really into magic (hence why I have a hard time getting into fantasy) but Brandon made allomancy so interesting that I found myself getting into it. The first action/heist scene with Kelsier really showed how creative and interesting this allomancy idea could be when used well, and that creativity continued through the trilogy. And even while I thought the story was basic, the characters were excellent. All flawed and realistic yet easy to root for. Vin and Kelsier were excellent co-protagonists, and I particularly liked how well they complemented each other: not only in personalities and outlook, but they would even call out each other's flaws and help each other to grow because of it. Sazed was also cool, and I really came to love Elend, especially as he became a main character in the latter books.

Books 2 and 3 brought all of the great parts of the first, like characterization, into a more unique story that ditched the typical dark lord plot for a far more original one. Brando Sando likes his slow burns but the payoff is fantastic. Elend had probably one of the most badass character arcs in existence in the second book, and the relationship between Vin and Oreseur was another great highlight. And that cliffhanger ending - man. I can't remember the last time a book gave me genuine chills.

I just finished the third book today, and don't really want to say much more in case anyone hasn't read the series yet, but what a well-plotted, well-crafted trilogy. The ending was a bit strange, but ultimately satisfying and actually left me a little teary-eyed. The villain felt threatening but also personable, and despite everything didn't really feel evil - just like a force, trying to do his thing. I like how Spook actually had something to do in this one. And honestly, Elend might have become one of my favorite fictional characters ever.

I just wanted to come here and unleash my appreciation for the series. I was a little hesitant at first since I was never much of a fantasy guy, but this was the perfect intro into the world of  adult fantasy. I'll definitely be reading more Brandon Sanderson, and I think I've opened my mind to more books in the genre in general. I just saw a post challenging people not to recommend Sanderson, but Imma refute that by saying I think he just made me a fantasy nerd, and I only heard of him because of the people on this subreddit. That is all. Just had to gush about this trilogy for a minute.",Fantasy
1681487774.0,What to do when you've read all of the good books?,"**Edit2: Oh Reddit, I love you. I'm turning off notifications for the night, but make sure to sort by controversial! :)**

&#x200B;

I've read Sanderson, Abercrombie, Butcher, Erikson, Martin, Hobb, and Jordan. I've either read what's at the bookstore, or have dismissed it as trash because I know it's not for me. Why aren't there any good books left? What am I supposed to do? Do I just re-read now? I should just re-read now, right?

**Edit: I know a lot of you stopped reading here, but maybe keep on going ;)**

Okay the title and that opening paragraph is clickbait, except it isn't. I've been on Reddit for over a decade now (fuck I'm old), and I see this regularly. Either blatantly (posts with the exact same title as I've used) or more just as a frustrated ""I have no idea how to find anymore books from what I've been reading."" Most book places tend to get a little stuck with what they love, and there tends to be a feeling that there's nothing else ""good"" out there beyond the little circle.

I've decided to come to the rescue. This is a massive roundup of places to find your next favourite read.

**Read some Canadians**

None of you are reading enough Canadians. Tanya Huff. Charles R. Saunders. Spider Robinson.  Élisabeth Vonarburg. Charles de Lint.  Nalo Hopkinson. Eileen Kernaghan.  Silvia Moreno-Garcia. Robert J. Sawyer. Nancy Kilpatrick.  Julie E. Czerneda. Peter Watts. This list continues.

Your first stop would be the check out the [Prix Aurora Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Award_for_Best_Novel) to get started. Then, check out the [Sunburst Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburst_Award), which often has very different winners from the Aurora Awards. Then, check out my essay about Canadian SFF [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/67wnmh/reflections\_on\_community\_and\_gender\_in\_canadian/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/67wnmh/reflections_on_community_and_gender_in_canadian/) \-- reddit isn't letting me link it in).

**Check out the Aurealis Award**

With some categories going back to the 90s, the [Aurealis Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurealis_Award) offers up an amazing selection of fiction that is often difficult to find on big box shelves here in Canada (since, let's face it, this is a Canadian-centric post). I also recommend you check out the anthology category - there's some fabulous work in there, including Kisses by Clockwork and Bloodlines (...or was it Bloodstones I read? They're both edited by the same person...you know what? Get both just to be sure).

**Read Jo Walton's Short History of the Hugos**

Now, this seems like a weird one, but trust me. You don't need to have liked a single book ever shortlisted by the Hugos to find immense value in this book for the sheer book recommendations Walton offers. I'm talking year over year lists of what she read from the 50s to 2000. She also brings into the book the World Fantasy Awards, too, which offers a completely different list of books a lot of times.

**Check out Janny Wurts' post history**

Trust me. This woman knows more obscure, underrated books than I do, and that's quite an admission on my part. I did a [short roundup of her recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/c306z8/janny_recommends_some_of_the_books_janny_wurts/) a few years ago to get you started.

**Sign up for the ebookaroo newsletter**

It's difficult to get a wide net of indie book recommendations on r/Fantasy (we tend to recommend just a handful of authors that rotates out every year), so I think [ebookaroo is a great way to find new-to-you authors](https://pattyjansen.com/ebookaroo/). It's ran by SFF author Patty Jansen who's Australian, for those who need that extra info ;) ), and I think it's weekly (might be every 10 days, I forget), and contains a mixture of box sets, new releases, free books, giveaways, sale books, and all of that. It's quite a mixture, too. I often find new SF in particular to read through it.

**Check out our top lists...starting oldest first**

[Scroll right on down to 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/lists/) and start there. r/Fantasy's tastes have changed a lot over the years (except for the Top novels. That tends to be the same with some recent bias). All of the other ones, however, I've found change a far amount over the years and so I really do think giving it a go from the bottom up would work for so many people here.

1685857747.0,"Friend and I are looking for non-military ""competence porn"" - people who are just EXCELLENT at their jobs","**UPDATE: I HAVE AGGREGATED THE LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS THREAD INTO A SPREADSHEET**   
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12gohixpu8k4x4UYFkOqCehDou05Kmc8HFcosrR7PRGY/edit?usp=sharing   

It has links to goodreads. If a series was recommended, I only added the first book. 

------

Hey guys, I just finished Project Hail Mary and was telling my friend about the story. He correctly identified my description, along with The Martian, as fitting into the genre of, as he terms it, ""competence porn"".  

- character excels at their job because they have worked hard to attain the skills, not because they are The Chosen One who is Supernaturally Special.     
- the thing they're good at is not violence, martial arts, killing, or military strategy. the more mundane the better, although thieves or  politicians might fit in this category.
- you get to see them do the thing they're good at, so you are kinda ""learning how it works""
- frequently doesn't have an actual antagonist; the setting just presents a situation where the protagonist's skills are needed
- they are applying their skills in either unexpected ways (thinking outside the box) or at a virtuoso level of skill

FWIW when you're recommending stuff, we both like hopepunk/cozy stuff more than grim stuff, but that's not necessary to the original idea. 

I also think heist stories *can* fit here, but some of them don't, because often the characters just get lucky and everything goes their way, or because they're ""the chosen one"" of cleverness. I think Locke Lamora doesn't work, for example, because he's just supernaturally good at lying and disguise, even above and beyond all the practice he and his crew get.

He gave a couple other examples:  

* The Dragon's Banker by Scott Warren    
* Machine, by Elizabeth Bear   
* Monk and Robot by Becky Chambers   
* Cithrin in The Dagger and Coin by Daniel Abraham  
* Tara in Three Parts Dead by Max Gladstone  
* Apollo 13 (movie)   
* Fred the Vampire Accountant brushes on this, because his accounting skills frequently save the day, although you don't spend much of the books ""seeing"" the accounting happen  
 
some stories that have a bit of military stuff in them but lean closer to what we're looking for: 

* Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City - KJ Parker  
* in The Expanse - Anna Volovodov (the minister), Avasarala is on the edge of it because she's a politician  
* Gen from The Thief/Attolia series by Megan Whalen Turner  

Baru Cormorant might fit, but we both hated it so much we didn't finish the first book, so I can't tell you for sure.   

Murderbot is technically a great example of the IDEA of competence porn, but we're specifically asking for some recs that DO NOT include violence. Plus murderbot was programmed that way ;)

edited to add:
holy moly, I've NEVER gotten a response like this on a post before. This is amazing! Thanks for all your suggestions. Many of them I have read but didn't include either to keep the post ~~short~~ less endless, or because I forgot, or because we were trying to be specific enough in the request to prevent every fantasy book ever from qualifying, lol!

I think for me, the ultimate thing that helps a book fit in this category we've made up is whether I get to watch the person do their skill, step by step. Extra cool if I learn about the skill, too.

Finally, someone pointed out a non fantasy book, which reminded me that the realistic fiction kids' books My Side of the Mountain and Island of the Blue Dolphins fit this category as well. They were some of my favorites as a kid.",Fantasy

1666396444.0,Things from Tolkien No One Copies,"Everyone thinks of Tolkien as the father of Epic Fantasy.  His influence was huge...but sometimes exaggerated.  There are things everyone thinks came from Tolkien that did not.  There are things that Tolkien did that have seldom been imitated.  

What things elements from Tolkien are rarely imitated?  

I'll start.  The MC.  Few books that aren't parodies have hobbits, and few have one hundred year old gentry as MCs.  (Street rats, thieves, and young nobles are more common.)",Fantasy
1636941038.0,DUNE - Do yourself a favor and try the book,"I just have to voice this here if anyone is on the fence like I was. Was thinking about reading Dune for years, but a lot of common criticisms get levied at it: boring, sterile, confusing, pretentious, and slow.

After watching the film I really wanted to spend more time in this universe, so I grabbed my Kindle and found myself blasting through the first 100 pages and had to force myself to go to bed. Now I keep thinking about it. I'm now at page 300 and I'm loving it more and more. Can't wait to get past where the movie ended.

Let yourself decide if you like it. The plot, political complexities, subtle yet expert character work, immersive world building, and touches of dark fantasy/scifi is so satisfying. There is some older forms of English wording present in the text I struggle with, but nothing a dictionary can't help. It's not slow at all; the pacing is really satisfying and tense. The dialogue is nuanced and clever, with a smooth shifting of POV within scenes. You get a really clear idea of what's going on in the minds of each character in a given conversation. The plot is relatable in the sense that you can think about what's going on and meditate on the complexities of our own world/context. My favorite thing about the book is how the chapters flow. It provides a sort of instant gratification in how the scenes and plot progress, which makes me want to keep reading.

If you enjoyed the film, I think you should try the book. My main gripe with the film is I didn't think the character work had enough room to breathe. The book satisfies my gripe. My fantasy background is primarily Tolkien, Abercrombie, and Sanderson. If you like the First Law I think you'll feel at home here if you enjoy the sinister political atmosphere. Feel free to recommend anything else that you think I or others might enjoy.",Fantasy
1615043152.0,Fantasy has taken the magic out of magic.,"I've loved magic, horror, and the supernatural for a long time (big fan of Tolkein, Lovecraft, etc) and so I've been struggling lately to try and figure out why so much current fantasy (Sanderson, Hobb, for example) bores the hell out of me. Its been very frustrating, especially when fantasy seems on the cusp of a renaissance, to find yourself bored out of your mind. It wasn't until I started reading magical realism that I figured it out, that as the title says, a lot of modern fantasy has taken the magic out of magic.

I'll explain using Mistborn. In Mistborn, magic is has very rigid rules. Everyone knows it exists. Government programs use it for suppression. It's even powered by minerals that need to be mined. An extremely industrialized magic. It is, for all intents and purposes, just an alternative science. And so Mistborn is really just a matter of watching people use the science of their world to solve problems in a straightforward, very materialist and pragmatic way. Reading the book, I felt bored.

Just this week, I turned to magical realism and started reading A Murmur of Bees. It's set in our world, during the Spanish Flu epidemic. When it become clear that little Simonopio >!can speak to the bees that kept him company while he was abandoned as an infant, and that he can see the future,!< I felt that familiar rush of wonder. It was exciting and it drew me in! the reason is: his magic takes place in a world where it is not part of the natural order; it is a strange, mysterious intrusion, inexplicable and also wonderful! It bears that mark of total otherness from the quotidian world, something truly supernatural.

I get it, of course, different strokes for different folks. Some people love magic that is just actually alternative science, that's a mundane, well known part of the fantasy world inhabited by the protagonists. And you are not wrong to like what you like.

But I think there is room for more fantasy that treats magic as something truly outside of the natural order: that still confronts us with what is not understood (and maybe can't be), that upsets our materialistic understanding of the universe rather than supporting it. 

Just thought I would submit this for discussion. Has anyone else felt this way? Does anyone have book suggestions where magic is still magic

Edit: Oh my God, thank you guys! This has been such an interesting conversation and I appreciate all the book suggestions so much. I'm a big reader, but it's been really hard to find books I can get her into lately, and this is great for me.

And thank you for the awards!",Fantasy

Absolutely Fantastic.","I'm obviously a bit late on this, but this is coming from someone who's heard great things about Discworld on reddit and elsewhere. This week I just finished my first book, *Guards, Guards!* and I'm already hooked. The references and humour were amazing and I even sent some friends pictures of the excerpts with no context (and they haven't read Discworld either).

I loved how dragons were portrayed in the book, and carrot might be one of my favourite non-serious characters of any book I've read

We, as readers, are allowed to point out inconsistencies and call out authors for their mistakes. Though we should always remember to be reasonable in our commentary and not hate on an author just because we can. That being said, fans have every right to defend their favorite authors and stories.

However, every time someone mentions that Tolkien is hard to read, or points out Martin’s hypocrisy and Pullman’s delusions when it comes to their comments on Tolkien (yes, I see my own hypocrisy), throwing a tantrum is just ridiculous.",Fantasy

1591465146.0,The Gentleman Bastards is absolutely amazing,"If you care only about my opinions skip down

First off, I have only listened to the first 2 book, now yes, listened not read, but I wanted to use my free Audible credits, and a book tuber named Daniel Greene greatly recommended the Gentlemen Bastards series. So the first book was 22 hours so I thought it was a good idea to get a long book for free rather then a short one, so I picked up ‘the lies of Locke Lamora’ and after I finished, oh my, this is one of the best books ever (that I have read)

SKIP HERE

Now, the first book, the Lies of Locke Lamora was amazing, I plan to listen to it again cuz it’s so great, but the reason why, it doesn’t just follow the ‘good guys’ the main characters, the gentlemen Bastards are dirty thieves, the book is kind of a heist but in a fantastical world, the main character don’t have any powers beyond being just really great at stealing. Now that may sound boring, but no, the book is also about saving the criminal underworld, it is an amazing combination that I have never seen anything like (not that I’m sure well read) but I immensely enjoyed it, and I hope you would too, please, if your interested ask any questions in the comments, also the first book has a finish that doesn’t demand you read the next book, so if you read it and think ‘meh’ then you don’t need to pick up the second 
Anyway I hope this was helpful, I have been told it’s one of the most underrated series, but I hope this will encourage more people to read it

They were like on death´s door but they got rescued in the . I really dislike this kind of writing. If the main antagonists do not suffer setbacks in some of the books, then it seems that the tension will be lost, or least for me. My critic seems to be premature since i have not finished the books yet. But everything Nathair does works out very well. I still like the books and will continue reading them. I find this trope annoying. 

This is not only about TFATF series but many series fall into making the antagonists infallible until the final book.

If the antagonists do not suffer setbacks or defeats, how would a villain learn, evolve, grow and reflect  on the mistakes that one made.

I understand that authors write this way to create more tension and desperation for the protags, but this annoys me especially when reading Courage and seeing every antagonist win or escape at the last moment.

These shows need ridiculously high viewer numbers in order to be profitable.  There is no book or series popular enough to get the ratings a show needs by simply bringing in the original fans alone.

These shows are made specifically for non/new fans. 

Studios know that they will likely be able to keep the majority of book fans no matter what, because we are loyal to the author/series, etc. But even if they lose most of us, so what?

As cynical as it sounds, they don’t really need us. They don’t have to be 100% loyal to the source material, just enough to make a show that new people will be into.

This also means that even if we the fans, in our echo chamber, think a show sucks - the studio may view it as a success.

Like it or not, Wheel of Time was a massive success, ratings wise. Witcher was too. 

Even Blood Origin seems to be doing well with viewers. 

Folks, we are not the target audience. 

We are the happy bonus. 

EDIT: To be clear, though, I blame studios on this more than (most) showrunners. I know many don’t agree, but I think most of these showrunners are still passionate about the source material (Rafe Judkins for example)",Fantasy

1596380337.0,Some excellent fantasy books by Black authors,"Though almost absent in the early years of fantasy writing, the number of Black authors—and the recognition of their work—is growing year by year.

It’s impossible to talk about fantasy written by Black authors as a cohesive genre because, like writers of other skin tones, Black authors come from all over the world and write about a wildly diverse array of subjects in their own unique ways and voices.

Despite that, I’m including this list because most other lists of fantasy books tend to be heavy on white folk, and trumpeting the achievements of Black authors should help balance that out a little bit.

Note: I’m using “Black” instead of “African-American” because a number of these authors are not American.

 

#23. *The Haunting of Tram Car 015* by P. Djèlí Clark – 2019

Finalist for the Hugo, Nebula, and Locus awards.

Cairo, 1912: The case started as a simple one for the Ministry of Alchemy, Enchantments and Supernatural Entities—handling a possessed tram car.

Soon, however, Agent Hamed Nasr and his new partner Agent Onsi Youssef are exposed to a new side of Cairo stirring with suffragettes, secret societies, and sentient automatons in a race against time to protect the city from an encroaching danger that crosses the line between the magical and the mundane.

#22. *Kingdom of Souls* by Rena Barron – 2019

*Book 1 of 2 in the Kingdom of Souls series*

Heir to two lines of powerful witchdoctors, Arrah yearns for magic of her own. Yet she fails at bone magic, fails to call upon her ancestors, and fails to live up to her family’s legacy. Under the disapproving eye of her mother, the Kingdom’s most powerful priestess and seer, Arrah fears she may never be good enough.

But when the Kingdom’s children begin to disappear, Arrah is desperate enough to turn to a forbidden, dangerous ritual. If she has no magic of her own, she’ll have to buy it—by trading away years of her own life.

Arrah’s borrowed power reveals a nightmarish betrayal, and on its heels, a rising tide of darkness that threatens to consume her and all those she loves. She must race to unravel a twisted and deadly scheme… before the fight costs more than she can afford.

Life in real-world Atlanta isn’t always so simple, as Alice juggles an overprotective mom, a high-maintenance best friend, and a slipping GPA. Keeping the Nightmares at bay is turning into a full-time job. But when Alice’s handsome and mysterious mentor is poisoned, she has to find the antidote by venturing deeper into Wonderland than she’s ever gone before. And she’ll need to use everything she’s learned in both worlds to keep from losing her head… literally.

#20. *Dread Nation* by Justina Ireland – 2018

*Book 1 of 2 in the Dread Nation series*

Jane McKeene was born two days before the dead began to walk the battlefields of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania—derailing the War Between the States and changing the nation forever.

In this new America, safety for all depends on the work of a few, and laws like the Native and Negro Education Act require certain children attend combat schools to learn to put down the dead.

But there are also opportunities, and Jane is studying to become an Attendant, trained in both weaponry and etiquette to protect the well-to-do. It’s a chance for a better life for Negro girls like Jane. After all, not even being the daughter of a wealthy white Southern woman could save her from society’s expectations.

But that’s not a life Jane wants. Almost finished with her education at Miss Preston’s School of Combat in Baltimore, Jane is set on returning to her Kentucky home and doesn’t pay much mind to the politics of the eastern cities, with their talk of returning America to the glory of its days before the dead rose.

But when families around Baltimore County begin to go missing, Jane is caught in the middle of a conspiracy, one that finds her in a desperate fight for her life against some powerful enemies.

And the restless dead, it would seem, are the least of her problems.

#19. *The Ballad of Black Tom* by Victor LaValle – 2016

This novella was a finalist for the Hugo, Nebula, Locus, World Fantasy, and Bram Stoker Awards.

People move to New York looking for magic, and nothing will convince them it isn’t there.

Charles Thomas Tester hustles to put food on the table and keep the roof over his father’s head. He knows what magic a suit can cast, the invisibility a guitar case can provide, and the curse written on his skin that attracts the eye of wealthy white folks and their cops. But when he delivers an occult tome to a reclusive sorceress in the heart of Queens, Tom opens a door to a deeper realm of magic, and earns the attention of things best left sleeping.

A storm that might swallow the world is building in Brooklyn. Will Black Tom live to see it break?

#18. *The Good Luck Girls* by Charlotte Nicole Davis – 2019

Aster, the protector

Violet, the favorite

Tansy, the medic

Mallow, the fighter

Clementine, the catalyst

The country of Arketta calls them Good Luck Girls―but they know their luck is anything but.

Sold to a “welcome house” as children and branded with cursed markings.

Trapped in a life they would never have chosen.

When Clementine accidentally kills a man, the girls risk a dangerous escape and harrowing journey to find freedom, justice, and revenge in a country that wants them to have none of those things. Pursued by Arketta’s most vicious and powerful forces, both human and inhuman, their only hope lies in a bedtime story passed from one Good Luck Girl to another, a story that only the youngest or most desperate would ever believe.

It’s going to take more than luck for them all to survive.

#17. *The Palm-Wine Drinkard* by Amos Tutuola – 1952

This classic novel tells the phantasmagorical story of an alcoholic man and his search for his dead palm-wine tapster. As he travels through the land of the dead, he encounters a host of supernatural and often terrifying beings—among them the complete gentleman who returns his body parts to their owners and the insatiable hungry-creature. Author Tutola mixes Yoruba folktales with what T. S. Eliot described as a “creepy crawly imagination.”

#16. *The Water Dancer* by Ta-Nehisi Coates – 2019

Young Hiram Walker was born into bondage. When his mother was sold away, Hiram was robbed of all memory of her—but was gifted with a mysterious power. Years later, when Hiram almost drowns in a river, that same power saves his life. This brush with death births an urgency in Hiram and a daring scheme: to escape from the only home he’s ever known.

So begins an unexpected journey that takes Hiram from the corrupt grandeur of Virginia’s proud plantations to desperate guerrilla cells in the wilderness, from the coffin of the Deep South to dangerously idealistic movements in the North. Even as he’s enlisted in the underground war between slavers and the enslaved, Hiram’s resolve to rescue the family he left behind endures.

#15. *Mumbo Jumbo* by Ishmael Reed – 1972

Hailed by Harold Bloom as one of the five hundred greatest books of the Western canon.

In 1920s America, a plague is spreading fast. From New Orleans to Chicago to New York, the “Jes Grew” epidemic makes people desperate to dance, overturning social norms in the process. Anyone is vulnerable and when they catch it, they’ll bump and grind into a frenzy. Working to combat the Jes Grew infection are the puritanical Atonists, a group bent on cultivating a “Talking Android,” an African American who will infiltrate the unruly black communities and help crush the outbreak. But PaPa LaBas, a voodoo priest, is determined to keep his ancient culture—including a key spiritual text—alive.

#14. *Skin Folk* by Nalo Hopkinson – 2001

Stories in this collection range from science fiction to Caribbean folklore, passionate love, and chilling horror. Author Nalo Hopkinson spins tales like “Precious,” in which the narrator spews valuable coins and gems from her mouth whenever she attempts to talk or sing. In “A Habit of Waste,” a self-conscious woman undergoes elective surgery to alter her appearance; days later she’s shocked to see her former body climbing onto a public bus. In “The Glass Bottle Trick,” the young protagonist ignores her intuition regarding her new husband’s superstitions—to horrifying consequences.

#13. *A Stranger in Olondria* by Sofia Samatar – 2013

Jevick, the pepper merchant’s son, has been raised on stories of Olondria, a distant land where books are as common as they are rare in his home. When his father dies and Jevick takes his place on the yearly selling trip to Olondria, Jevick’s life is as close to perfect as he can imagine. But just as he revels in Olondria’s Rabelaisian Feast of Birds, he is pulled drastically off course and becomes haunted by the ghost of an illiterate young girl.

In desperation, Jevick seeks the aid of Olondrian priests and quickly becomes a pawn in the struggle between the empire’s two most powerful cults. Yet even as the country shimmers on the cusp of war, he must face his ghost and learn her story before he has any chance of becoming free by setting her free: an ordeal that challenges his understanding of art and life, home and exile, and the limits of that seductive necromancy, reading.

#12. *The Fifth Season* by N. K. Jemisin – 2015

*Book 1 of 3 in the Broken Earth Series*

It starts with the great red rift across the heart of the world’s sole continent, spewing ash that blots out the sun. It starts with death, with a murdered son and a missing daughter. It starts with betrayal, and long dormant wounds rising up to fester.

This is the Stillness, a land long familiar with catastrophe, where the power of the earth is wielded as a weapon. And where there is no mercy.

The band is a hodgepodge, full of unusual characters with secrets of their own, including a shape-shifting man-animal known as Leopard.

As Tracker follows the boy’s scent—from one ancient city to another; into dense forests and across deep rivers—he and the band are set upon by creatures intent on destroying them. As he struggles to survive, Tracker starts to wonder: Who, really, is this boy? Why has he been missing for so long? Why do so many people want to keep Tracker from finding him? And perhaps the most important questions of all: Who is telling the truth, and who is lying?

#8. *The Rage of Dragons* by Evan Winter – 2017

*Book 1 of 2 in The Burning series*

Everyone else is fodder, destined to fight and die in the endless war.

#7. *Everfair* by Nisi Shawl – 2016

What if the African natives developed steam power ahead of their colonial oppressors? What might have come of Belgium’s disastrous colonization of the Congo if the native populations had learned about steam technology a bit earlier?

Fabian Socialists from Great Britain join forces with African-American missionaries to purchase land from the Belgian Congo’s “owner,” King Leopold II. This land, named Everfair, is set aside as a safe haven, an imaginary Utopia for native populations of the Congo as well as escaped slaves returning from America and other places where African natives were being mistreated.

#6. *Zoo City* by Lauren Beukes – 2010

*Correction: Lauren Beukes is South African, but white. Thanks to the redditors that pointed this out.*

Zinzi has a Sloth on her back, a dirty 419 scam habit, and a talent for finding lost things. When a little old lady turns up dead and the cops confiscate her last paycheck, Zinzi’s forced to take on her least favorite kind of job—missing persons.

Being hired by reclusive music producer Odi Huron to find a teenybop pop star should be her ticket out of Zoo City, the festering slum where the criminal underclass and their animal companions live in the shadow of hell’s undertow. Instead, it catapults Zinzi deeper into the maw of a city twisted by crime and magic, where she’ll be forced to confront the dark secrets of former lives—including her own.

> *“Beukes delivers a thrill ride that gleefully merges narrative styles and tropes, almost single-handedly pulling the ‘urban fantasy’ subgenre back towards its groundbreaking roots.”*

And when she travels to America for college, a traumatic event on campus crystallizes the selves into something powerful and potentially dangerous, making Ada fade into the background of her own mind as these other selves―now protective, now hedonistic―move into control.

When Paama leaves him for good, she attracts the attention of the undying ones—the djombi—who present her with a gift: the Chaos Stick, which allows her to manipulate the subtle forces of the world. Unfortunately, a wrathful djombi with indigo skin believes this power should be his and his alone.

Kindred is an astonishing, fantastic book. Author Butler is a master. This book is often considered science fiction, but it easily could be called fantasy.

Rufus, the white son of a plantation owner, is drowning, and Dana has been summoned to save him.

I remember GRATUITOUS rape and sexual slavery. I remember the main character having to play football to beat communism.

1639596382.0,Denis Villeneuve to adapt Arthur C. Clarke's RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA after he is done with DUNE,"Denis Villeneuve [has lined up](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/denis-villeneuve-rendezvous-with-rama-movie-1235062337/) his first post-**Dune** duology project. Villeneuve will be tackling a film adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's classic 1973 science fiction novel, *Rendezvous with Rama*.

Set in the year 2130, *Rendezvous with Rama* charts what happens when an apparently huge, rogue asteroid enters the Solar system. A probe flyby reveals that the object is in fact a geometrically perfect cylinder, fifty kilometres long, and clearly of alien origin. The spacecraft *Endeavour* is diverted to intercept the object, which is dubbed ""Rama."" Penetrating the interior of Rama, the explorers discover an entire alien world held within a cylindrical construct, apparently devoid of organic life...but that does not mean it isn't dangerous.

*Rendezvous with Rama* is Clarke's most acclaimed novel, even moreso than *2001: A Space Odyssey*. *Rama* won the Hugo, Nebula and John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Novel, as well as the Locus, Seiun, Jupiter and BSFA Awards. The book features a fictional space agency mission to look for rogue asteroids, known as Spaceguard. In 1992 NASA created a real Project Spaceguard, inspired by the fictional one. Since 1992, the Spaceguard and related programmes have discovered tens of thousands of Earth-orbit-crossing asteroids and comets.

Clarke returned to the setting sixteen years later, co-writing with former NASA engineer Gentry Lee a sequel trilogy dubbed **The Rama Cycle**: *Rama II* (1989), *The Garden of Rama* (1991) and *Rama Revealed* (1993). Lee later wrote two more novels in the same universe, but not featuring a Rama spacecraft: *Bright Messengers* (1995) and *Double Full Moon Night* (1999). These novels were not as well-received as the original book. Clarke noted that he considered these sequels to constitute one ""possible"" continuation or sequel to the original story, not the definitive one.

The novel has previously been adapted as a 1996 video puzzle game (inspired by *Myst*) and a 2009 BBC Radio adaptation. Morgan Freeman is a huge fan of the novel and in the 1990s picked up the film rights. He developed the project for many years, bringing on David Fincher to direct. The Freeman-Fincher partnership to make the film endured into 2012 before Fincher departed. Freeman noted that finding a script and finance for the film was difficult, partially due to the high vfx requirements but a distinct lack of traditional action sequences. Villeneuve is the perfect director to tackle this project, having encountered and overcome a similar restriction with his 2016 movie *Arrival*.

Alcon Entertainment (who shoot **The Expanse** for Amazon) will produce and finance the film. They are looking for a studio distribution partner. Villeneuve will tackle the project once *Dune: Part Two* is released in late 2023. Villeneuve had previously voiced a desire to adapt the second **Dune** novel, *Dune Messiah*, after completing the original novel, but it sounds like that would have to wait until after *Rendezvous*.",Fantasy

The spoiler free part, in case anyone still needs convincing to watch the show: 

* The whole cultural worldbuilding is *amazing*. I was super surprised when I realized the show was produced in America for the most part, simply because it's so unlike any other Western cartoons I've ever seen.   
* The writing and character development in this supposed kids' show put a whole lot of more supposedly 'mature' series to shame. 
* The animation is absolutely gorgeous, especially whenever there's combat.
* Aside from Legend of Korra, is there literally anything else remotely like this show? I've seen Trollhunters, which is also a decent YA/teen fantasy show, but I feel like it doesn't quite match the brilliance that is Avatar, at least so far. (Will be watching Korra next anyway, but after that?)  
* Really this show has everything you want from a good fantasy TV show. It's funny, it's epic, it's got really good dialogue, the conflicts feel real for the most part, the magic/bending is great and used fantastically (though if it weren't PG13, that stuff would look a lot different I imagine) 

---
Okay, and here come the spoilery parts 

* [Zuko's character arc](#s ""Zuko is no doubt my favorite character in the show and his whole story/development is freaking amazing. I love how much time the show takes to show him going from angsty spoiled brat with a vengeance to badass redeemed villain and hero"")  
* [Katara and romance](#s ""I don't know how popular or unpopular an opinion this is, but I was surprised and a bit disappointed that Katara ended up with Aang. All throughout the series, it seemed like she really liked him, but not necessarily in a romantic way. I thought Zuko and Katara had way more chemistry and was hoping that *that* was endgame shipping material. I don't even particularly dislike the development of her relationship with Aang, I just thought Zuko fit way better."") 
* [Bending](#s ""I love love love the development of bending over time, like how Katara discovers bloodbending and how Toph invents metalbending. I am stoked to see how these things get picked up again in Korra - I watched the first episode already so I know that metalbenders are now a thing."") 
* [Sokka](#s ""I'm not sure how much of an established trope/archetype this is, but Sokka is a fantastic example of the whole 'the one normal person among OP people' thing. The show gave him time to deal with that without it ever becoming annoying. Also, Sokka is hilarious and I love him"")

1645019942.0,"I'm reading every Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and World Fantasy Award winner. Here's my reviews up through 1990 (Vol 6)"," Hello again! Turns out that there are a lot of books out there. 

**Neuromancer by William Gibson**

* **Plot:** A down and out hacker gets in over his head.
* **Page Count:** 271
* **Award:** 1984 Hugo, 1984 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: Yes.
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Oh sweet saskatoons.
* **Review:** Look, it's great, alright? Does the story jump wildly? Sure. Does it require more than one reading? Probably. And yeah, it's intentionally confusing. But the plotting is superb - truly breakneck speed. And just what a world. It's spectacular. It's work to get into it, but I enjoyed the heck out of this.

**Mythago Wood by Robert Holdstock**

* **Plot:** There's a fine line between myth and reality, one that doesn't exist within the Wood.
* **Page Count:** 274
* **Award:** 1984 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Hard Fail
* **Technobabble:** Fantasy Babble in Spades.
* **Review:** Very clever premise and good writing that ultimately lack payoff. Unavoidable and excessive sexism to astounding levels. Obsession is a good character trait - but it's also the only one that anyone in this book has. Plot events occur for the sake of something happening - without reason, often without impact. They just... happen. Also, obsessively explaining the rules of this world while then having arbitrary new rules sneak up for plot convenience feels silly.

**Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card**

* **Plot:** When the Buggers return, we're going to need the greatest military mind Earth can produce to stop them. Which means we need to start training young.
* **Page Count:** 256
* **Award:** 1985 Nebula, 1986 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: Absolutely
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Possible Technical Pass? But Likely Fail.
* **Technobabble:** Moderate.
* **Review:** Look, it's great, okay? Writing is solid, characters are consistent, pacing is deftly executed. Stakes are maintained throughout. Relentless nature of issues brilliantly done - the moment one issue is solved, another appears. It's just a really great book. It's got some flaws, sure. But it's just a joy to read. I'm also extremely biased: this is also the first real science fiction book I can recall reading, when I was nine.

**Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card**

* **Plot:** Ender Wiggin travels to the only planet where humans are interacting with another species, in the hopes of finding somewhere to leave the Bugger Queen.
* **Page Count:** 419
* **Award:** 1986 Nebula, 1987 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Moderate.
* **Review:** A very different side of Ender, but a believable development. A truly massive cast of characters to keep track of, for the most part successfully. The Piggies are excellent - aliens with confusing customs, misunderstandings, physiology, and so on. And all grounded with some compelling and heartbreaking human drama. A worthy follow up to *Ender's Game*.

**Xenocide and Children of the Mind by Orson Scott Card**

* **Plot:** Buggers, Piggies, and Humans all live together in uneasy peace. But the descolada virus lives with them, lethal to humans. Perhaps the only way to stop it is to destroy the planet.
* **Page Count:**  

   * **Xenocide:** 592
   * **Children of the Mind:** 370
* **Award:** Books 3 and 4 of a series; 1 and 2 won awards.
* **Worth a read**: No. Which hurts to say.
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Mucho.
* **Review:** Were you satisfied with the evolution of Ender from *Ender's Game* to *Speaker for the Dead?* Good, because we're done with character development. Massive cast of characters, each with one negative character trait, which is fixed by the end of the story. Slapdash inclusion of galactic politics to try to add stakes instead rips out the human core of the Enderverse. Meanders unpleasantly - actual story has some interesting beats but could be told in a third of the time.

**Job: A Comedy of Justice by Robert Heinlein**

* **Plot:** When Alex comes to, he is not in his own world. Is God testing him?
* **Page Count:** 377
* **Award:** 1985 Locus Fantasy
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal to moderate.
* **Review:** All the fun of parallel worlds with no charm. Irritating characters responding in incomprehensible manners to unfortunate but often uninteresting twists of fate. New candidate for weakest female lead character in a book! Pacing is atrocious - up to and including a massive shift for the final third or so of the book, making it feel like two lackluster novellas. This book felt significantly longer than its 370 pages. Everything about this book feels half-baked and peculiarly self-indulgent.

**Song of Kali by Dan Simmons**

* **Plot:** It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to speak with an elusive author. But darkness and danger are everywhere...
* **Page Count:** 311
* **Award:** 1986 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: Maybe? But probably not.
* **Primary Driver:** Rare bonus: Atmosphere.
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal.
* **Review:** Excellent use of atmosphere, legitimately gripping as horror. Masterful interplay of understated yet unsettling and acutely horrifying. Pacing is slow but usually well executed to ratchet up tension. Like much horror, often hard to get behind the protagonist - he continues to do unreasonable things, and push himself needlessly further into these situations. Also, feels kinda... problematic. No one is slinging slurs around, but there's definitely some extreme fetishizing goin' down.

**The Postman by David Brin**

* **Plot:** Society has already collapsed. But someone needs to deliver the mail...
* **Page Count:** 339
* **Award:** 1986 Locus SF
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail (Slim chance that there's a technical pass, but... I don't think so.)
* **Technobabble:** Minimal to moderate.
* **Review:** I am a sucker for a good grifter, and Gordon Krantz is one of the best. He's one of the few ""full"" characters here - but I was rooting for him the whole time. The natural evolution of his role is believable; it keeps the story moving. His interpersonal interactions are also good - and the few other characters who are more developed are nicely done. *The Postman* stumbles when it tries to expand this small-scale story of a survivor to a broader world - pacing, plot, and character all suffer in the home stretch. Can be preachy about American Exceptionalism…

**Chronicles of Amber (Corwin Cycle) by Roger Zelazny**

* **Plot:** Amber, a parallel realm to ours, is in a state of turmoil. Fantasy hijinks ensue.
* **Page Count:**  

   * *Nine Princes in Amber: 175*
   * *The Guns of Avalon: 223*
   * *Sign of the Unicorn: 192*
   * *The Hand of Oberon: 188*
   * *The Courts of Chaos: 189*
* **Award:** None, but Book 6 (which begins the next quintet) won.
* **Worth a read**: Yes.
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot, World, or Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail (Unsure...)
* **Technobabble:** Fantasy Babble - yes
* **Review:** Delightful fantasy. Wildly unpredictable, charming protagonist, neat world. A deftly handled update to the standard sword and sorcery formula. Clearly written with tropes in mind, and uses them (or subverts them) to excellent effect. This is not an impactful read; it is not profound, or deeply thought-provoking, or anything else. It is instead a perfectly streamlined snack, and as such it is one of the best.

**Chronicles of Amber (Merlin Cycle) by Roger Zelazny**

* **Plot:** As much as Merlin wants to be his own person, Amber keeps pulling him in.
* **Page Count:**  

   * *Trumps of Doom: 184*
   * *Blood of Amber: 215*
   * *Sign of Chaos: 217*
   * *Knight of Shadows: 251*
   * *Prince of Chaos: 241*
* **Award:** *Trumps of Doom:* 1986 Locus Fantasy
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail.
* **Technobabble:** Mild fantasy babble.
* **Review:** A remarkable job of creating a sequel series. Takes the previous five books as a foundation and develops it, filling in details of the world. Also adds a new magic system – or, more accurately, adds new aspects to the already neat system of magic. Zelazny struggles a bit in giving Merlin a distinct voice from Corwin. Pacing stays quick, writing is cleaner than the earlier books. Merlin’s motivations are much clearer than Corwin’s as well. Totally enjoyable.

**Perfume: The Story of a Murderer by Patrick Süskind**

* **Plot:** If he gathers enough material, he'll be able to craft the perfect smell. He'll finally smell human.
* **Page Count:** 263
* **Award:** 1987 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**) + **Atmosphere**
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail.
* **Technobabble:** Barely.
* **Review:** Evil is a challenge. How do you make a monster believable? If it's too ridiculous, there's no justification. If motivations are too believable, well, your monster is not really evil. Süskind nails it. This is evil as a fundamental lack of morality; an indifference to the needs and wants of others. And it's terrifying. Pacing is not always great, plot meanders a bit - but the mood, which is the essential characteristic of a horror story, stays oppressive, and unsettling. At less than 300 pages, this is worth reading for that alone.

**Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card**

* **Plot:** In an alternate-history America, the seventh son of a seventh son is born with remarkable abilities.
* **Page Count:** 377
* **Award:** 1987 Locus Fantasy
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** None.
* **Review:** An intriguing alternate timeline that is ultimately undercut by bloat and poor pacing. Interesting use of different magic systems. Many well written scenes of believable family interaction, generally convincing interpersonal stakes. The protagonist, however, is the least compelling character by dint of being exceptional at everything. Weak antagonists as well. This book is longer than it needs to be, the series is even more so.

**Tales of Alvin the Maker by Orson Scott Card**

* **Plot:** In an America much like our own, Alvin is one of the only forces of order capable of countering the Unmaker.
* **Page Count:**  

   * **Red Prophet**\*: 311\*
   * **Prentice Alvin**\*: 342\*
   * **Alvin Journeyman**\*: 381\*
   * **Heartfire**\*: 336\*
   * **The Crystal City**\*: 340\*
* **Award:**  

   * **Red Prophet**\*: 1988 Locus Fantasy\*
   * **Prentice Alvin**\*: 1989 Locus Fantasy\*
   * **Alvin Journeyman**\*: 1995 Locus Fantasy\*
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass, but only barely. As in, I think in only one book.
* **Technobabble:** Mild fantasy babble.
* **Review:** The delicate crafting of Alvin's world gets wackier and wackier the further the series goes. Card desperately scrambles to cram any and all historical figures he can into the narrative with little to no justification. Pervasive religious themes come across as excessive. Slow plotting and attempts to overdevelop backstories leave the story at a standstill.
* **One Sentence Summaries of Each Book**  

   * **Red Prophet**\*:\* What this series really needed was more backstories and some genocide.
   * **Prentice Alvin**\*:\* Racism is bad, education is groovy.
   * **Alvin Journeyman**\*:\* The best way to add action to a series is including legal proceedings.
   * **Heartfire**\*:\* Witchcraft trials are not super-ethical.
   * **The Crystal City**\*:\* The real Crystal City is the friends we made along the way.

**Replay by Ken Grimwood**

* **Plot:** Jeff Winston dies of a heart attack and returns as his younger self. What would you do with a second chance?
* **Page Count:** 311
* **Award:** 1988 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: No.
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal to none.
* **Review:** The most generic possible take on (de facto) time travel. Dislikable protagonist doing the blandest and most predictable possible things. If you've read anything similar, you know every single beat of this story. Unremarkable writing. Slow pacing. Completely underwhelming.

**Soldier of the Mist by Gene Wolfe**

* **Plot:** Latro forgets everything: he must keep a close record on a scroll. Even his meetings with gods.
* **Page Count:** 335
* **Award:** 1987 Locus Fantasy
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Nah.
* **Review:** A lot of fun elements that do not quite gel. All of the basic elements of story are good: interesting cast of characters, particularly the cameos from different gods; cool settings as we wander through ancient Greece; generally good pacing. It is the central conceit of this book that makes it hard to read: it feels like 20% of the text is Latro either being informed or informing others that his memory does not work. It gets exhausting - and while the rest of this is better than competent, it's not enjoyable. Also, Wolfe's terrible at ending books.

**Soldier of Arete by Gene Wolfe**

* **Plot:** The great amnesiac adventure continues!
* **Page Count:** 354
* **Award:** None, but books one and three of the trilogy won.
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail.
* **Technobabble:** None.
* **Review:** A less-inspired continuation of the Latro's journey. Wolfe's love of obtuse allusions to historical events and figures would make this a compelling mystery if this was even remotely engaging. Neither characters or situations draw the reader in enough to make this feel like more than a slog. Actual quality of writing is quite high - deft use of imagery, poetic phrasing that avoids feeling overdone. But all in service of an underwhelming product.

**Soldier of Sidon by Gene Wolfe**

* **Plot:** Our favorite amnesiac soldier is back, but this time he's in Egypt!
* **Page Count:** 320
* **Award:** 2006 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: Not really.
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** No.
* **Review:** Did you like the military adventures of Sir Forgetful the first two times it came out? Then this is a great book for you. A different set of supporting characters and a new location - as well as a significant in-world time jump - offer surface level differentiation from the previous volumes. But once the adventure actually begins it is more of the same. Slow pacing and constant reminders of amnesia punctuated with occasional excellent scenes involving the gods. Also, Wolfe's still terrible at ending books.

**The Falling Woman by Pat Murphy**

* **Plot:** An estranged mother and daughter are reconnected on a troubled archeological dig.
* **Page Count:** 287
* **Award:** 1988 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** None
* **Review:** A bland coming of age story/relationship drama with pretensions of being either horror or suspense. Characters are flat: the woman who threw herself into her career and ignored her family, the man who needs to protect people, the old woman who is superstitious. Story is a plodding mess that is meant to give the characters and their interactions the spotlight - but characters don't deliver, and the whole thing crumbles. Boring and predictable.

**Falling Free by Lois McMaster Bujold**

* **Plot:** Quaddies were genetically engineered to thrive in null gravity. Too bad they're basically kept as slaves.
* **Page Count:** 320
* **Award:** 1988 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: For a Vorkosigan Saga completionist: Yes. But can be skipped.
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Yes.
* **Review:** One of the weaker stories in the *Vorkosigan Saga.* Characters lack depth - and the childlike state in which the quaddies are kept becomes grating. Pacing is decent and the story is somewhat engaging. Leo Graf, the main ""standard"" human character, is far more compelling than any of the quaddies. Corporate greed is a believable but underwhelming bad guy, because \[gestures vaguely at everything\].

**Cyteen by C J Cherryh**

* **Plot:** The only person brilliant enough to run the cloning colony cannot live forever - but a perfect copy of her can take her place.
* **Page Count:** 680
* **Award:** 1989 Hugo and 1989 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Oh yes.
* **Review:** Slow, dull, and plodding, this book is a rough read. Interpersonal relationships are the backbone of the story but a lack of believable or compelling characters make it all fall flat. Beneath it all are some legitimately interesting questions of identity and self, couched in the context of cloning but more broadly applicable. These are posed as unresolved questions, and would be better served by a short story than a text girthy enough to pull a body underwater.

**The Healer's War by Elizabeth Ann Scarborough**

* **Plot:** A nurse in Vietnam tries to navigate the everyday danger of life on the front, and puts herself at risk to care for others.
* **Page Count:** 336
* **Award:** 1989 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** None
* **Review:** Turns out the Vietnam War was not that great. Turns out being a woman in a warzone is not that great. Turns out viewing your enemies as subhuman is not that great. This is a character-driven story, and is semi-autobiographical. Kitty is likeable enough, though inconsistent. There is not really a story, exactly. She is thrown from one situation to another, usually without agency of her own. Pacing is all over the place. Not a terrible book but feels like yet another war story in a long line of such.

**Koko by Peter Straub**

* **Plot:** A series of murders over many decades point to only one person: Koko. But his former squad mates could have sworn he was dead...
* **Page Count:** 562
* **Award:** 1989 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Doesn't really apply.
* **Review:** Turns out that the Vietnam war was pretty much not a good thing. Superb use of atmosphere and mood coupled with generally good writing. Plot is not great, heavy flashbacks break flow of present-day story. Scenes of gratuitous gore and violence are at first shocking and then become dull. Most characters are flat, making it hard to stay invested in what is a heavily people-driven story. Ends up feeling more like an experience than a story. And gets relentlessly depressing.

**Mystery by Peter Straub**

* **Plot:** The best detective out there - a misanthropic bookworm - tackles corruption and violence in his own backyard.
* **Page Count:** 548
* **Award:** Sequel to *Koko*. No awards of its own. Published 1990.
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass.
* **Technobabble:** None.
* **Review:** A delightful if surprisingly dark mystery/adventure. Elevated above comparable stories by compelling protagonists and a clear love of books woven throughout. As is the case with many mysteries, some jumps are a bit contrived - but the suspense elements deliver, and Straub's writing shines. Excellent character work.

**The Throat by Peter Straub**

* **Plot:** Tim Underwood and Tom Pasmore team up to investigate a death close to Underwood.
* **Page Count:** 692
* **Award:** None, final book in *Blue Rose Trilogy*
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** None.
* **Review:** A decent horror thriller with interesting meta-fiction elements. However, it feels less like a culmination of a trilogy than a retread, and does not build appreciably upon *Mystery*. Main character work generally solid, but falls off for side characters. Writing is good, plot is messy. Pacing is alright for a 700 page tome, but the story does not justify its length.

**Lyonesse Trilogy by Jack Vance**

* **Plot:** Kingdoms vie for supremacy, wizards do the same, and the fairy folk mock them from the sidelines.
* **Page Count:**
* **Suldrun's Garden:** 436
* **The Green Pearl:** 406
* **Madouc:** 544
* **Award:** Madouc - 1990 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass.
* **Technobabble:** Some magic gibberish.
* **Review:** A fantasy epic with a remarkable number of storylines, sometimes told out of chronological order. As a demonstration of how to effectively interweave a huge number of characters and plots this is a masterclass. This does not, however, make it an enjoyable read. Character work is underwhelming - a few standouts highlight how flat most of the others are. Pacing is choppy - sudden frenetic bursts followed by 100 page slumps. World feels pretty standard for medieval fantasy - tricky fae, conspiratorial wizards, arrogant monarchs. Ultimately there is nothing terribly wrong with this trilogy, it just does not feel worth 1300 pages.

**Hyperion by Dan Simmons**

* **Plot:** Seven pilgrims journey to the one place that connects them: the planet Hyperion.
* **Page Count:** 492
* **Award:** 1990 Hugo, 1990 Locus SF
* **Worth a read**: Yes. Right now.
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot, World, or Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Possible Pass?
* **Technobabble:** Moderate.
* **Review:** Hot diggity dog. What a book. It's a masterpiece. The world is great. The characters are distinct and fantastic. A sense of mystery permeates everything, as well as urgency. Every plot beat is woven brilliantly - each character telling their story informs another, fills in blanks. But doesn't overfill! Keeps things mysterious! World building both answers and raises questions - but so, so, so well. Writing is crisp, pacing is great. I cannot recommend this one enough. Go! Get thee to a bookery!

**The Fall of Hyperion by Dan Simmons**

* **Plot:** The Shrike is not the only threat facing the pilgrims of Hyperion, and much needs to be resolved before the Time Tomb opens.
* **Page Count:** 517
* **Award:** 1991 Locus SF
* **Worth a read**: Yes.
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail(?)
* **Technobabble:** Yeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh
* **Review:** A decent sequel, though a huge change in both tone and format from *Hyperion.* Characters are solid, though heavily dependent upon their development in the first book. Plot is interesting enough to keep raising questions - but not every answer is satisfying. Pacing is all over the place - intermittent monologues pause everything for the sake of exposition. Read it because you've read the first book.

The Bechdel Test is a simple question: do two named female characters converse about something other than a man. Whether or not a book passes is not a condemnation so much as an observation; it provides an easy binary marker. Seems like a good way to see how writing has evolved over the years. At the suggestion of some folks, I’m loosening it to non-male identified characters to better capture some of the ways that science fiction tackles sex and gender.

Greetings Ladies and Gentlemen, Elves and Demons,

On August 17, 2018 the fantasy cartoon comedy Disenchantment by Matt Groening, creator of the much beloved Simpsons and Futurama, was released with a second season soon following. Since that day, my every waking moment has been consumed by dark festering vitriol for the show. Okay, maybe not every moment. But this is an internet rant, I’m obligated to exaggerate a little, right? In truth, I find the show fascinating despite my dislike for it. If you’d be so kind I’d like to use this post to vent my explosive animosity in a raving rant that will attempt to parse the contrasting reactions people have had to the show and construct a theory about which elements attract or repel the differing audience factions.

There seem to be two major camps: people who liked the show and people who were very meh about the show. I haven’t really seen anyone who actually hates the show in the same way as, let’s say, the Eragon movie adaption. The people who dislike it seem to think it was boring and unfunny, but not to a painful degree. They simply stopped watching or finished but were underwhelmed. Despite my introductory ravings, I fall into this camp. I don’t hate Disenchantment; it’s just boring.

Some of my dislike, I think, is a matter of my expectations. I was looking forward to Disenchantment partially because of Futurama’s reputation for its nerdy sci-fi references and so my thought was that this show would have a similar degree of genre savviness. I had seen articles puffing up the show as Groening’s lampoon of contemporary fantasy shows like Game of Thrones.

This expectation turned out to be dead wrong. As a mindless hatefan of the show, I have devoured interviews by Groening from which flowed an obvious conclusion: Disenchantment is not a lampoon of contemporary fantasy like Game of Thrones but a parody of classic fairy tales and fantasy from Groening’s youth.

[Groening listed his influences](https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/disenchantment-influences-list/ls029771332/?ref_=ls_mv_sm) as works like Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Italian Folktales by Italo Calvino (1956), Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride (1987), Jabberwock (1977), The Wizard of Oz (1939), and the original Pinocchio (1883). He also pays a bit of lip service to Lord of the Rings, though it sounds like he just assumes it’s an influence because of how foundational it is to the genre.

Notice a trend? As iconic as many of these works are, they’re all over 40 years old. The most recent influence he lists is the 20-year-old Spirited Away.
Where Futurama oozed with creative usage of the setting and genre, Disenchantment trickled. Even just comparing the pilots of the two shows, Futurama has relatively uncommon sci-fi concepts like suicide booths and heads-in-jars while Disenchantment’s pilot has an unwanted arranged marriage and Lollipop Guild Keebler elves.

Is this a bad thing? Did Groening do something wrong? Technically, no. I don’t consider contemporary relevance an artistic virtue, but it certainly impacts the appeal of the show. This is what I believe dictates the watershed of audience reactions.

I think that those who are looking for the humor in the show to be derived from satirical takes on fantasy tropes, references, or creative usages of the fantasy genre are going to be bored by uninspired rehashing of half-century-old tropes while those who are more drawn to Groening’s character-focused banter and slapstick comedy will be amused.

An example of this divergence of reactions may the scene where our protagonist Princess Bean makes a drunken fool of herself at a diplomatic banquet. Groening intended this to be funny in two ways: first, as the timeless [Alcohol-Induced Idiocy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy) gag and, second, as the subversion of proper princess behavior.

[As Groening explains](https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/tv/matt-groening-disenchantment-influences-50816), “The reason why she drinks so much is not because I'm fond of alcohol jokes. It's because I want you to know from the beginning that this is not Cinderella, and this is not Disney. It's like, 'What wouldn't Disney do?' Well, they wouldn't have the princess get drunk!""

This is our first hint that Groening’s focus on classic fairy tales and tropes is not an informed artistic choice but a byproduct of being uninformed about the nuances of contemporary fantasy. 

Sure, a kid-targeted company wouldn’t get a princess drunk, but Cinderella was released 70 years ago, and Disney is full-throttle into an era of bucking many of the tropes they’ve been criticizing for in the past and dozens, more likely hundreds, of stories have bucked that particular trend before. Disney’s 2007 Enchanted is a great example of how this type of parody has become mainstream and it’s long ago wormed its way into the mainline princess films. Seeing a princess misbehaving is the expectation, not the exception.

When I say in the title that the writers of Disenchantment aren’t into fantasy, I don’t mean to gatekeep. It seems that recently Groening has rediscovered an old love of the fantastical and that is a beautiful thing. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that Groening is into a very narrow and outdated type of classic fantasy which has led him to believe he is being subversive when he is truly being by-the-numbers. Such as when the witch turns out to be the misunderstood victim in Disenchantment’s take on Hansel and Gretel. Once again, it was not surprising, it was expected, and, therefore, it was uninteresting.  

As for the other writers, I can’t truly comment on them because they seem to be kept on a tight leash. Bafflingly, he has a [rule against Game of Thrones](https://mashable.com/article/matt-groening-disenchantment-game-of-thrones-reference-easter-egg/) references and has admitted to actively shooting down his writers’ attempts to get around the rule. 

“’I had to flat-out say: “This has nothing to do with Game of Thrones.”’ Yet people still tried to sneak it in occasionally, leading Groening to put his foot down even more. ‘No — we are not doing it!’”

Another interview I read hinted at some tension between the older and younger writers on staff and I would imagine the older writers usually won any disagreements due to seniority.

“We have a writing staff that’s a combination of old guys from Futurama and The Simpsons and some younger writers who definitely have a different point of view,” [says Groening](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/03/matt-groening-goes-back-to-the-drawing-board-for-disenchantment/). “They just don’t understand the appeal of old character actors from the 1930s and ’40s.”

Groening had been watching Game of Thrones, but actively stopped watching for the three years he made Disenchantment because he didn’t want to be influenced by it. While I can wave away much of his lack of fantasy knowledge as the harmless result of age gaps, I can’t think of a term to describe this other than willful ignorance. Perhaps Groening truly does consciously intend for his take on fantasy solely to focus on old classics. Like I said, there isn’t anything technically wrong with this and I don’t think being a fantasy fan has anything to do with how up to date you are or how much you’ve consumed, but I guess it’s hard for me to believe someone is truly a  fan when they go out of their way to avoid reading or watching fantasy. How does someone who is into fantasy seriously not have a single influence made within the past two decades?

As Stephen King famously suggests, the best way to improve your writing is to read as much as you can. Surely an inverse rule could be suggested. Something like “The best way to cripple your writing is to avoid reading.” Suddenly, the shallowness of Disenchantment’s fantasy setting makes sense. Elsewhere, there are hints that this avoidance has fed into certain misunderstandings he has about the genre. 

""The tendency for fantasy – and many Hollywood films – is 'good versus evil,' we tried to make the world not so black and white,"" [Groening said](https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/disenchantment-influences-list/ls029771332/mediaviewer/rm2828972032).

Hmm. Yes. If only we had more dark versions of fairy tales laced with moral ambiguity. Funnily enough, I wouldn’t even say Disenchantment succeeds at moral ambiguity. In every situation where it counts, Bean is kind to the unfortunate, loyal to her friends, opposes evil, and apologizes for her mistakes. Such dilemmas are always clear cut. Even the demon’s only crimes are being snarky, smoking, and giving up his immortality to save his drinking buddies. What’s that? That last one didn’t sound like something an incarnation of pure evil would do? How subversive! The demon was good at heart all along! Friendship saving the day truly is heartwarming. Ugh. Disney’s [Descendants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descendants_\(2015_film\)) was more morally ambiguous than Disenchantment. (Don’t watch Descendants though. Disenchantment was way better. Descendants was cringe, and I love musicals.)

Groening’s avoidance of contemporary fantasy also seems to fit poorly with his attempt to have Disenchantment be his first narrative focused project. Disenchantment’s story is passable, but uninspiring. Bean, the rebellious princess who always does the right thing in the end turns out to be the chosen one…but chosen for evil! How innovative.

Is it so surprising that much of his audience is bored by Groening’s take on Fractured Fairy Tales when many of them, myself included, have grown up hearing the fractured versions before they hear the originals?

And so, my theory is that those looking for fantasy parody will likely not be amused by Disenchantment’s subversions that are actually clichés, but those who are there for wholesome lowbrow humor and drunken buddy shenanigans, or have little exposure to other works of fantasy, may be satisfied. Despite utilizing the fantasy genre, Groening has no obligation to make it more than a pretty backdrop for character comedy to suit my somewhat snobbish fantasy tastes. Narrowing audience appeal is not a crime. 

Regardless, I think Groening thinks he is being innovative with the fantasy genre when he is not.

“Every time I thought of a different kind of fantasy trope, I’d write it down and see if there was a way of sticking it in the show. I have lists of every kind of small mythical forest creature: gnomes, fairies, imps, goblins, gremlins, trolls, plus a bunch that I can’t remember right now. It’s all there in the notebook. But it’s hard. If you want to tell jokes about elves and dragons and so on and so forth, pretty soon you realize, Oh, every single dragon joke has already been made,” [Groening said.](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a22627833/matt-groening-disenchantment-netflix-interview/)

Perhaps it is telling that when he discusses fantasy tropes, he lists surface-level set pieces. Perhaps it is telling that his image of elves is more in line with a cookie commercial than one of their hundreds of portrayals in various fantasy works.   

I think this is a tale of an expert stepping outside of his wheelhouse and stumbling. I want to emphasize that Disenchantment is a competently executed show. The jokes are competent. The story is competent. The characters are competent. But, they’re bland and boring. There is nothing new to be found here, and Groening does not wield the old clichés well enough to imbue them with new life.

Still, trying new things is to be commended. I hope his experience with this show results in Groening being exposed the marvelously deeps and rich fantasy worlds he is missing out on. As he is a cartoonist, I’d recommend he start with some Disney shows that blow his out of the water in terms of creative fantasy settings and narrative strength like Gravity Falls and Star vs. the Forces of Evil. I’d also say he should read Pratchett, but, shockingly, he has. I wouldn’t have won that bet.

Thanks for letting me vent my bile! Am I simply blinded by my incoherent hater rage or am I enlightened by supremely logical righteous anger? If you liked Disenchantment, was it for the fantasy stuff or for the other elements in the show?

1712684639.0,I am a little conflicted on Jade City,"Jade City is a fantasy ganster drama. It revolves around Kaul family, one of the two big clans in charge of the city of Janloon, the capital city of Kekon. Kekon is the only place in the world where Jade - a magical, mystical substance that gives wearers mystical powers - is naturally found. The book is about how Jade affects the lives of our characters, how it affects the customs, the myths, the culture of Kekon, and the clan conflict that erupts to control this substance.

On one hand, the things I love. I love the characters. All the Kauls are very well written, and I like all of them. The prose - very good, very atmospheric, no word out of place. The world building is fantastic too. I love how much impact jade has on the story. Also, the book is less of a fantasy, and more of a gangster drama. Jade is magic sure, and the book is set in a completely different world, sure. But there are telephones, cars, aeroplanes and what not. So it feels less like a classic fantasy, and more like a crime drama which I found to be a really nice change of pace for me.

On the other hand, the things I dislike. It feels like there is no urgency in the plot. Momentous things happen, but they don't feel momentous because they haven't been built up properly. Moreover, I didn't particularly enjoy the resolution of the plot, it felt very anti climactic to me. For whatever reason, the book failed to evoke any strong emotions out of me.

I am going to continue reading the series though because the world building and the characters have hooked me.

**THOUGHTS:**

This is a solidly plotted story with a strong protagonist and somewhat inconsistent supporting cast/villain?, but it's so much more of a thoughtful, personal, moving story that the emotions alone make this an early contender for favorite read of the year.

There are a lot of questions asked about religion and faith, that Mills answers, or sometimes doesn't, with what I thought had a lot of nuance and care. Depending on your religious sensibilities, I could see the messaging being either very pro- or anti-religion, because at its heart it's a story about a person's internal wavering of faith and questioning the gods while still holding such love for them as a core part of her identity and path. I thought it was well done, but I can see there being some split here.

I love a nonlinear story.

I love a book that I can highlight punchy lines and think about them out of context and sit in admiration of the talent of the writer.

Wings nailed telling such a close, personal story in the midst of what seems (and is) grand, epic, theological turmoil. It's an achingly fierce and angry story that punches you in the gut over and over, and makes you ask how and why we perpetuate cycles of abuse and disillusionment while reminding you how easy and realistic it is to remain helplessly stuck in that pattern. Still, it's a story about about self-discovery, the freedom of choice, and the poignant ethos of a religious agape love, unrequited and beautiful in its selflessness.

Mills has style. Her writing worked great for me - it might not for everyone, but I think people would still be able to recognize the talent behind it if the particular style didn't vibe with them.

**SUMMARY:**

This is a science fantasy story about a a mecha paladin, a city, and its 5 gods who went to sleep over two decades ago. We follow Zenya, a 40+ year old Winged warrior, and her personal struggle with faith as her world falls apart fighting to hold onto the gods' love that was never theirs to begin with. It's a nonlinear story told in alternating timelines, Zenya's formative years giving depth to her current timeline crisis and showing the person she was, is, and has always been. The plot and pacing is exhilarating at times with tense and visceral action, but it's more of an emotional character study than a plot-centered action story.

**CONCLUSION:**

Wow. Mills writing left me teary-eyed and wanting more while hurting my heart to continue reading on. I haven't heard enough buzz about this and think it could be an under the radar gem if people pick it up.

If you read this and often skip Author's Notes or Afterwords, please don't skip this one. Mills summarizes this book way better than I ever could, and the Afterword is a work of art as a standalone piece of writing. I'll leave it on this last quote from Mills's Afterword, that without context won't carry the same weight, but if you know, will make you feel things.

Of the “pre-cyberpunk” stories that Shurin has introduced us to so far, this is one has a more obscure pathway to cyberpunk, but Leiber’s style actually is really good at evoking that “messy, lived-in state” and the revelation that the woman he’s on a date with seems to have a masochistic fetish was probably more shocking in 1950 than it is to me in 2024. (As a side note, I feel like the funniest thing in this story was the visitor successfully bribing a cop with $5, though apparently that would be $66 today.)

* **fanny’s thoughts:** I am familiar with Lieber from the *Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser* series and this was distinct. This was a difficult read for me as I do not like reading about abusive situations. This is a realistic, purity extreme future where the virtue of a woman is from keeping her face covered. I guess they at least get a lot of different masks and one is grey and lacy which stuck out to me. It’s an interesting exploration of that type of society and focuses on one woman and a man not from the society. Society is somewhat violent against women and presents some of the worst sides of misogyny and toxic masculinity. Overall this was not the most pleasant read and >!seeing a woman go back to the abusive situation does not even sit well with me. I know it happens. I just hate reading it!<.

**“With the Original Cast” by Nancy Kress** (1982)

People with ESIR implants can remember past lives, and a woman who remembers being Joan of Arc is cast as her in a new play, to disastrous results.

* **Special Guest Mike:** What struck me most about this 42-year-old story was just how *relevant* it felt. New technology appears. People get excited about the possibilities. Someone uses new technology to create art, with much hype and fanfare. The new art sucks. New technology means new possibilities, but that doesn’t mean those possibilities are going to be what you want them to be. There are other discussions that could be had about this story – bet you $1 that some of the folks behind the Assassin’s Creed franchise have read this one – but this is a great example of how science fiction has such staying power. The details of technology may change, but the questions of how we humans will interact with it will always persist.

* **Farragut:** Kress has won multiple awards for her short fiction, most noticeably for the novella *Beggars in Spain* (later expanded in a novel of the same name). I thought this was an excellent story that fit exactly with the editor’s theme for this section, with the rather fantastical reincarnation implant allowing people to summon up the knowledge of the past, solely to delve deeper into theater and realism. However, we follow the very controlled Barbara Bishop, and her role (ha!) in this story is just so strong, especially as she tries to get our somewhat addled narrator to understand reality vs. illusion. Highly recommended.

* **fanny:** This story was a very interesting take on technology and art. ESIR, the technology, is not explained in detail, but I got the idea well enough. The idea of using the “original” cast because you can did not lead to good art, which is kind of expected. There are some surreal parts that try to show the difference between reality and perception, but I think I needed a bit more to understand what was happening. It seemed like a trip and since the person was in the hospital it may have been. Overall, I liked it a lot. Agree with our special guest that the Assassin’s Creed people read this. 

**“Dogfight” by William Gibson & Michael Swanwick** (1985; also available in his collection *Burning Chrome*))

Deke, a lazy thief, gets sucked into a VR dogfighting game and it consumes him enough to isolate him from everyone else.

* **Farragut:** We read Gibson in [Week 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1aep4af/reading_the_big_book_of_cyberpunk_week_1/), and Swanwick is another multi-awarded author. I thought this story really captured the addictive nature of games, and a culture of veterans playing it, with Deke as the newcomer who gets an edge through the help of a friend he betrays due to his newfound addiction. He is not a nice man, and this was a well-done story that really made me feel the ashes of Deke’s life at the end.

* **fanny:** The main character in this story is so unlikeable. He is motivated entirely by selfish reasons and it is somewhat explained, but he’s still awful. This is a dystopian future where technology is heavily integrated into society and a lot of it is mind control. I thought the actual fighting game circuit was pretty cool. Especially how the authors talked about a combat vet being the best at it and it giving him purpose. We follow a MC who is trying to make money at any cost and does not care who is harmed in the process. The ending was unexpected for me as I thought this would go in a different direction, but this story better fits the dystopian future it was in. The brainlock was the most interesting part and how it could be used to trigger extreme responses for any chosen situation, though it seems cruel especially the chastity one.

**“Glass Reptile Breakout” by Russell Blackford** (1985)

At a music club in Melbourne, the new genre of biofeedback-music causes small miracles to occur, but not everyone is on board with these events.

* **Farragut:** Blackford is an Australian academic and writer, and this was probably the most Australian cyberpunk story I’ve read yet; the fact that it was commissioned for an anthology featuring original Aussie SF probably had something to do with it. This seemed like a fun mix of SF and possibly fantasy, as Biofeedback Music can apparently help heal people’s bodies in small miracles, though it mainly occurs with the counterculture of healing implants and “flickerdance” (cutting yourself while dancing and the cuts are healed almost immediately). The actual plot seems to involve an evil spy who gets his comeuppance and a reluctant Church bishop who decides to accept BF music. Just incredibly bizarre, but really underscores the technology being the pathway for culture.

* **fanny:** I found the interaction between manipulation technology and music in this story extremely fascinating, even if I was a bit confused. Music and festivals can be a tool to bring people together and in this case it was being used for a spiritual ritual and healing. We also have the investigators and a person full of darkness trying to manipulate the situation to their advantage. I liked the message of hope triumphing over hate that I took from this story, but it didn’t erase the harm caused by the hate blocking the healing.

1712667499.0,Just listened to shadows of the apt 10 years after reading the series,"I just absolutely love this series.  Adrian Tchaikovsky is such an underrated author.

I know shadows of the apt isn’t popular.  I’ve read that people find the first book generic or hard to get through or whatever, but this is hands down my favorite fantasy not named Malazan.


There’s just so little fantasy similar to this.  It gives me the video game feeling where characters have special abilities and everything attempts to be logical even in a fantasy setting.  It’s not a love story like most series, it’s instead a borderline retelling of world war 2 seeing it from the eyes of the nazis and Europe.

That’s really it.  I have no one else to talk to about this lol",Fantasy
1712666983.0,The unbearable anxiety that I'll never get to them all,"I have always had a peripheral love and respect for fantasy. I grew up reading Harry Potter and fairy tales then I went to college and read things that should not bear repeating. (Let's just say one of them starts with fifty and ends with grey). Just before lockdown, I got into fantasy because of some Booktubers: Merphy, the goblin, Regan etc. and I did end up reading a lot more fantasy than I'd have expected. Then I joined this sub, then I made fantasy friends. And now my fantasy tbr is in the hundreds.

 I have ""priority"" reads because they're what I am most excited to get into: LOTR, Discworld, Mistborn, Broken Earth, Murderbot, The Magicians, Elderslings, Earthsea, Stormlight, Memory Sorrow and Thorn, Dark Star etc. i haven't had the easiest last two years. And it was hard to find time to read and I did. I started many series that I will finish in the next 5-10 business years. But I have to wonder are there books that should ""officially"" be on a priority list. Say I die a year from now and I'm sentient, which books would I regret not having read. ",Fantasy
1712665807.0,Series or books with characters seeking redemption?,"I recently read **The Obsidian Path** series by *Michael R Fletcher* (would recommend though its quite dark) and was reminded that one of my favourite character arcs is characters
attempting to find redemption for events in their past - regardless of whether they deserve redemption or succeed in achieving it. Some examples of other books that feature this 
that I love are:

>!**Use of Weapons**!< by *Iain M Banks*

>!**Between Two Fires**!< by *Christopher Buehlmann*

And in some way:

>!Raif!< in **The Sword of Shadows** by *J V Jones*

I'm not so interested in characters who don't feel they deserve redemption - like >!Logen!< in **The First Law** - or characters who don't feel they need redeeming 
like Jorg in **The Broken Empire**. I find it tends to self-pitying or nihilistic characters.

I'd also like the character searching for redemption to be a main or major POV character.

1712662243.0,Searching for hidden gems,"Hi, folks. Let's share a bit of knowledge about unknown, but good fantasy novels/series.

I've read or at least tried to read most of the known fantasy series and now i'm in trouble. Cause i love to read, not only fantasy, but with the developing of my reader's experience i found that most of the new fantasy (by the new i mean not the year of publishing, i mean new to me) doesn't attract me at all due to be poorly written and being so generic so you have a feeling you read thing thing hundreds of times before and doesn't give any joy to explore the new world.

And, well, i know it is hard to find because most of unknown fantasy is unknown because it's not very good actually, but i believe there are some good stuff that just missed it's opportunity to became famous.

Would be nice this to be something unique and by unique i mean there are no obvious alternatives and of course good writing skill is also appreciated.

From me you can grab next:

- Hussite trilogy by Sapkowski - good and almost unknown historical fantasy

- New Crobuzon trilogy by China Mieville - weird and charming dark-steampunk-fantasy. Looking on the list of awards, authors seems to be known and famous, by scrolling the Fantasy community i did not see anyone except me who was talking about it.

I'd love to read a book that deconstructs that trope in the way that while the rebellion's cause is true and the current family usurped the original they aren't actually tyrants. The state of the kingdom is far better then before and the people love their current rulers. 

So the rebellion will bring war and suffering and set back all the progress made just so the ruler has the right surname. Fix a couple of injustices by committing a thousand more, mostly to people unaware or uninvolved in this dispute.

**Row 4**

**Book Club or Readalong Book:** Orconomics by J. Zachary Pike

**SPFBO Standing:** Winner, SPFBO 4, also my re-read for this competition

*Professional heroes kill and loot deadly monsters every day, but Gorm Ingerson's latest quest will be anything but business as usual.*

*Making a Killing in Professional Heroics*

*The adventuring industry drives the economy of Arth, a world much like our own but with more magic and fewer vowels. Monsters’ hoards are claimed, bought by corporate interests, and sold off to plunder funds long before the beasts are slain. Once the contracts and paperwork are settled, the Heroes’ Guild issues a quest to kill the monster and bring back its treasure for disbursement to shareholders.*

*Of course, while professional heroics has been a great boon for Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and all the other peoples of light, it's a terrible arrangement for the Shadowkin. Orcs, Goblins, Kobolds, and their ilk must apply for to become Noncombatant Paper Carriers (or NPCs) to avoid being killed and looted by guild heroes. Even after getting their papers, NPCs are treated as second class citizens, driven into the margins of society.*

*Gorm Ingerson, a Dwarven ex-hero with a checkered past, has no idea what he's getting himself into when he stands up for an undocumented Goblin. His act of kindness starts a series of events that ends with Gorm recruited by a prophet of the mad goddess Al'Matra to fulfill a prophecy so crazy that even the Al'Matran temple doesn't believe it.*

*But there’s more to Gorm’s new job than an insane prophecy: powerful corporations and governments, usually indifferent to the affairs of the derelict Al’Matran temple, have shown an unusual interest in the quest. If his party of eccentric misfits can stop fighting each other long enough to recover the Elven Marbles, Gorm might be able to turn a bad deal into a golden opportunity and win back the fame and fortune he lost so long ago.*

This is an outstanding, original, twisty book that fully deserves its win in SPFBO 4 and has stood the test of time.

So what works?

Original takes on classic ‘D&D’ races, both NPC and PC.

Uncomfortably realistic parody of the real world financial system in particular but the world in general, from elves with purse kobolds to forlorn love.

Hidden, but not so hidden enemies.

Interparty conflict that makes ‘sense’.

Lots of twists and turns.

If I were point to an SPFBO winner to read and outline on “how to win SPFBO” this would be the one, probably with updates from “Small Miracles”.

9/10

**Novella:** Tainted by Krystle Matar

**SPFBO Status:** Takes place concurrently with SPFBO7 Runner-Up Legacy of the Brightwash, and covers some of the same scenes from the viewpoint of a ‘minor’ character.

*Glaen must choose: the woman he loves, or freedom. Does he comply with the law of the Authority, or does he continue to see Gianna, the only light of his life? The consequences of his choice will ripple through more than he realizes. Revolution can start with a single shot.*

Full disclosure, Legacy of the Brightwash was my favorite read of 2022, so I’m inclined to rate this highly. This follows Glaen a tainted who has Tashue Blackwood, one of the MCs of Brightwash, as his regulation officer. Tainted means magically talented, which means your life is monitered, you are given a job suited to your talents, and your rights, particularly who love is restricted to non-tainted, and if you’re non-compliant, there a special prison just for you.

Yeah, the City of Yaelsmuir is a steampunk dystopia, and Glaen is in love with the wrong woman, who loves him back.

This follows one of the saddest parts of Brightwash, that we’ve read from Tashue’s PoV, from Glaen’s perspective, and it is even more of a tear-jerker here than in Brightwash. But it doesn’t end there, and Glaen gets a degree of cumuppance that ends in an upbeat note, but not a triumphant one, yet.

The best comparison for this series, with its limited power, corrupt yet distinct setting, is the Green Bone Saga by Fonda Lee. Reading this is like reading the Jade Setter of Janloon or any of the other short stories set in that world. It is best after you’ve read the main books. I don’t think this hangs quite as well on its own, but that still means this is damn good.

8/10

**Mythical Beasts:** A Touch of Light by Thiago Abdalla

**SPFBO Status:** SPFBO 8 Finalist

*Lynn, a rogue griffin rider, has uncovered a deadly madness that threatens to destroy the Domain. She can’t escape this enemy, but to fight it, Lynn must risk being found and branded a traitor by her old order.*

*Prince Adrian has never been pious or on good terms with his father. After losing those closest to him, however, he must either work with the king or convince the Church to deem his loved ones worthy if they are to have a chance at resurrection.*

*In the clanlands, where death is considered a necessity, Nasha fights to prove she belongs. A cursed hunter and a lifelong outcast, she has always struggled. But when the land itself begins to wither away, Nasha might be the only answer.*

I read this almost nine months ago and feel like I should have taken notes and I suspect I might like more on a re-read. It’s on my TBR for re-read, but it’s down the list a ways.

That said, this book is heroic fantasy which I’m starting to realize is not my jam. However, there are a lot of distinct bits throughout like relations with Griffins and a strange but cool religion and characters who were all very distinct.

For me, it is a 6.5/10

**Special Note:** This was Champion of Covers by Cassidy’s alternative SPFBO 8 where she gathered judges and ran an alternative finals that was very interesting and had very different results. My tastes doesn’t tend to align with Cassidy. Please don’t read this as a slight. What the judges do is hard work and deserves respect.

But, if you’re reading my reviews and thinking I’m an idiot with no taste, this might be the best book for you.

**Elemental Magic:** Reign and Ruin by J.D. Evans

**SPFBO Status:** SPFBO 7 Winner

*“All magic is beautiful...and terrible. Do you not see the beauty in yours, or the terror in mine? You can stop a heart, and I can stop your breath.”*

*She is heir to a Sultanate that once ruled the world. He is an unwanted prince with the power to destroy.*

*She is order and intellect, a woman fit to rule in a man's place. He is chaos and violence and will stop at nothing to protect his people.*

*His magic answers hers with shadow for light. They need each other, but the cost of balance may be too high a price. Magic is dying and the only way to save it is to enlist mages who wield the forbidden power of death, mages cast out centuries ago in a brutal and bloody war.*

*Now, a new war is coming. Science and machines to replace magic and old religion.*

*They must find a way to save their people from annihilation and balance the sacred Wheel—but first, they will have to balance their own forbidden passion. His peace for her tempest, his restlessness for her calm…*

*Night and day, dusk and dawn, the end, and the beginning.*

When I was reading one round reviews, the only argument I saw was an author who believed they had written a historical Norse fantasy be told by a judge that they had written a historical novel and the ‘fantasy’ elements were the type of thing that happens in real life. Norse Shamanism/mysticism were part of real life said the judge, an Asatru practitioner. Nothing fantasy happened in the novel.

Regardless of the which side you come down on, the novel hit a sore spot with the judge and I felt like if the book had found any other judge the book would not have faced that particular criticism.

Reign and Ruin hit a similar ‘sore spot’ for me and if I encountered it in the first round it would be rejected.  I think this is an example of the degree of ‘luck’ involved in judging process.

I picked up because it won SPFBO7. I started it, hated it, put it aside at about 40ish%.

But it had won SPFBO 7, and I struggled to understand it, especially since the runner-up was one of my favorite reads of the last few years. Then bingo dropped, and my reaction to the elemental magic square was ‘this is the type of magic authors with no originality use because they can’t think of anything better.’

Might as well get it over with.

Yeah, so I came into this process ready to hate this novel. But I wanted to understand why I hated this novel and to what would anyone see in it.

So, it is well written and the couple in this romantasy have definite chemistry, the setting is a cool Middle Eastern setting, if you’re not a period Nazi like I am. The gazes and descriptions of the two leads are very detailed. It has twists and turns that make sense. I read [this](https://beforewegoblog.com/spfbo7-reign-ruin-by-j-d-evans/)  SPFBO review and I found I agreed with every point.

The biggie that killed author creditbility for me is that I accept that young characters in modern fantasy are a little older than I would like for the age that they doing their ‘first’ adventures. To me, between fourteen and sixteen is the ideal combination of agency and inmaturity in a preindustrial society to start getting in ‘interesting’ situations. But I accept that this is younger than most readers/authors go with nowadays. I start to get annoyed when characters are over eighteen for no other reason than to offend modern sensibilities, especially if I feel their position, say cabin boy, would be filled by a younger character. But I can accept it and if everything else is well written/plotted, get over it.

But when a female MC character is being declared an adult at twenty-four and declared ready for marriage, my inner critic is seething. Especially because the setting is presented as very sexist. I’m literally remember screaming at the speaker in my car that a girl wouldn’t be given until twenty-four before either being married off or pushed into rebelling like a proper plucky princess with magical powers.

I felt like the evil vizier is just an evil vizier stock character from central casting. I’m not usually a fan of elemental magic, especially if they come with built in personality traits. I found the degree of physical description of the two hot leads in this romantasy annoying but fully accept others will embrace this.

Basically this book, in addition to a big thing, hit little thing after little thing that just happen to annoy me. But literally everything was a matter of MY, taste, preferences and prejudices etc.

But I have read books that are simply awful. This was not one of them.

So I finished the book. I see why others enjoy it. I do not love it. But I respect it for how it forced me to look at examine my own taste.

**Myths and Retellings** Fionn: Defence of Ráth Bládhma: The Fionn mac Cumhaill by Brian O’ Sullivan

**SPFBO Status:** SPFBO 2 Finalist

*IRELAND: 192 A.D. A time of strife and treachery. Political ambition and inter-tribal conflict has set the country on edge, testing the strength of long-established alliances. Following the success of their ambush at Cnucha, the Clann Morna tribe are hungry for power. Meanwhile, mysterious war parties roam the forests and a ruthless 'Tainted One' is intent on murder.*

*In the secluded valley of Glenn Ceoch, a disgraced druid and a woman warrior have successfully avoided the bloodshed for many years. Now, the arrival of a pregnant refugee threatens the peace they've created together. Run or fight, the odds against them are overwhelming.And death stalks on every side.*

This is about the babyhood Fionn mac Cumhaill, legendary Irish Hero, or rather his foster parents, Bodhmhall the druidess, and her lover and female warrior Liath Luachra as their settlement is threatened.

Characters were distinct and felt like they were people of their time. Historical setting worked. The book was generally likable, plot was good, but overall this book didn’t grip or stay with my once I had finished.

This very much felt like someone else’s favorite read and I hope this review helps them find this.

6.5/10

**Row 5**

**Queernorm Setting:** A Rival Most Vial by R.K. Ashwick

**SPFBO Status:** Finalist in SPFBO 9. Special Note, I considered holding my review of this because it is a current SPFBO finalist. I chose not to because it was low enough in the rankings and those rankings have been relatively consistent i.e. no wild swings between a 5.0 and a 9.0, for the same book, ~~that I find its position unlikely to change much~~ I didn’t think would change much until today’s review by Queen’s Book Asylum.

*Two potion shops, one heated rivalry…until hate bubbles over into something else.*

*Any adventurer worth their sword knows about Ambrose Beake. The proud, quiet half-elf sells the best, and only, potions in the city—until a handsome new shopkeeper named Eli opens another potion shop across the street, throwing Ambrose’s peace and ledgers far off balance.*

*Within weeks, they’re locked in a war of price tags and products—Ambrose’s expertise against Eli’s effortless charm. Toil leads to trouble, the safety gloves come off, and right as their rivalry reaches a boiling point…*

*The mayor commissions them to brew a potion together.*

*The task is as complex as it is lucrative, pushing both men to the limits of their abilities and patience. Yet as the fires burn and cauldrons bubble…they find a different sort of chemistry brewing.*

This book as a Queer Romance is an 8/10. As a sitcom setting about a group of friends it’s an 8/10. I can see why a lot of people like this book. But the main characters are potioneers and that is a job, albeit one that Ambrose loves.

But this story is that they could be about perfume makers in Paris or special effects types in Hollywood and only the window dressing and details of the story would change. Setting is a rather generic city in a D&D style world.

For me this book doesn’t work in a worldbuilding sense, and I’ve come up with a special term for it; the Flintstones/Jetsons line.

The magic is used to mimic the modern in a mundane, surface way. There is insurance and magical phone  equivalents to call family back home. This is very much like the SF elements of *The Jetsons* and unlike, say, *Orconomics* where the adventuring economy says A LOT about the larger world.

Therefore, rating it highly as a fantasy or even a speculative work, feels a lot like giving *The Jetsons* a Nebula or Hugo award.

6/10

**Coastal Setting:** Burning Bright by Melissa McShane

**SPFBO Status:** Semi-Finalist for Fantasy Faction, SPFBO 8

*In 1812, Elinor Pembroke wakes to find her bedchamber in flames--and extinguishes them with a thought.*

*At 21, she is old to manifest magical talent, but the evidence is unmistakable: she not only has the ability to start fires, but the far more powerful ability to control and extinguish them. She is an Extraordinary, and the only one in England capable of wielding fire in over one hundred years.*

*As an Extraordinary, she is respected and feared, but to her father, she represents power and prestige for himself. Mr. Pembroke, having spent his life studying magic, is determined to control Elinor and her talent by forcing her to marry where he chooses, a marriage that will produce even more powerful offspring. Trapped between the choices of a loveless marriage or living penniless and dependent on her parents, Elinor takes a third path: she defies tradition and society to join the Royal Navy.*

*Assigned to serve under Captain Miles Ramsay aboard the frigate Athena, she turns her fiery talent on England's enemies, French privateers and vicious pirates preying on English ships in the Caribbean. At first feared by her shipmates, a growing number of victories make her truly part of Athena's crew and bring her joy in her fire. But as her power grows and changes in unexpected ways, Elinor's ability to control it is challenged.*

*She may have the power to destroy her enemies utterly--but could it be at the cost of her own life*\*\*?\*\*

I liked this book. Elinor does a wonderful job balancing being a woman, raised for marriage in upper class England, yet also coming to a place where she can rebel against that upbringing, and join the Royal Navy. Here, the ability to set enemy ships on fire at a distance will cause the admiralty to put aside any concerns about gender.

And the rest of the book is similarly pays attention to detail and does a good job of keeping the reader invested.

The romance with her Captain is not rushed and is very much a slow burn. This is an enjoyable read, not a SPFBO winner but solid.

7.5/10

**Druid:** Becoming a Druid by Mike Mollman

**SPFBO Status:** Entry for SPFBO 9, reviewed by Fantasy-Faction

*Grahme has wanted to be a druid for as long as he can remember. Talented but headstrong, he runs afoul of a despotic, mind-controlling mage during his initiation quest. The price of failure is death. Intrigue and distrust has turns his order against him. Haggard, hunted and without his magic, Grahme must make impossible sacrifices or lose everything.*

This follows Grahme, apprentice druid who has alientated two masters and is on his third. He is therefore given an incredibly tough initiantion test, as in instead say deliver a message, his is confront essentially a Dark Lord who his master feels his fellow Druids are ignoring.

I enjoyed the setting which was modeled on Iron Age Britian. Grahme to me was an enjoyable protagonist, though I suspect a lot of readers will find him annoying. I was less enthralled with the magic, which is very D&D, to the point I felt I could quote a Players Handbook, though the underlying philosophy of this world’s Druidism felt very non mechanical in the best soft magic sort of way.

I don’t think this is everyone’s type of book, but I have put the sequel on my TBR.

7.5/10

**Features Robots:** Angel From the Rust by Jason Link

**SPFBO Status:** Entry for SPFBO 9, Reviewed by Becky M and an ‘almost’ Semi.

*They say Earth was a place of wonders, where towers pierced the clouds, cities lit up the night, and flying machines streaked across the sky. It was magic. But the magic conjured the End War. Fire fell from the sky, and metal beasts leveled the cities.*

*That was six hundred years ago. Now the ruins of the Ancient world are buried or overgrown. And the technology of the past is feared as forbidden magic.*

*Corvala, a young musician on the run from the law, never intended on getting mixed up with history. But when a murderer falls from the heavens and sets himself up as a god, she’s driven into the wilderness and discovers the secret of her bloodline: a code of immense power embedded in her DNA. The code could save thousands—or plunge her into madness.*

*To defeat the tyrannical false god, Corvala must do something more terrifying than confront the demons of Earth’s history. She must confront her own.*

This book does a lot right. There are stakes, Corvala’s mother went insane and this is likely to happen to her. She is a musician and wants to do well with the time she has. This defiance makes me like her immediately.

There are small details, like the book taking place in the Pacific Northwest, though this is not explicitly stated. There is a great arc with the MC’s father, who is a cop who believes technology is evil, like most people in the setting do. There is a guardian robot named Serapha, who resembles an angel.

There is a space station in orbit of our Earth, and a murderer exiled from the station with mind control powers and an understanding of ancient technology which is the main antagonist aside from the creeping insanity which is a wonderful thing to inflict on your SF heroine.

There are some quibbles. Corvala reads a bit too much like a modern for my taste and the world is a little too YA for my taste.

This is an enjoyable entry, but it is DQ’d on account of being SF, with no genuine fantasy elements in sight.

7.5/10

**Special Note:** There was one SF book that qualified as a SPFBO semi-finalist for being so damn badass that I believe the judge said “fuck the rules, this has badassery”. I agree with that assessment. That book is The Nothing Within By Andy Giesler. Best Amish post-apocalyptic novel you will find anywhere.

**Sequel:** Miss Percy’s Travel Guide to Welsh Moors and Feral Dragons by Quenby Olsen

**SPFBO Status:** Sequel to SPFBO 8 finalist Miss Percy’s Pocket Guide to British Dragons

*First, there was a trunk. Inside the trunk was an egg, and inside the egg was…*

*Well, it certainly was not a chicken.*

*Miss Mildred Percy, former wallflower and current adventurer, is now in charge of a dragon. Along with Mr. Wiggan and Mrs. Babbinton — our stalwart companions from the first volume of Miss Percy’s adventures — she embarks on a journey across Wales, in search of the mysterious Nyth y Ddraig, or Nest of Dragons.*

*But traveling with a young dragon in an unfamiliar land proves more difficult than anticipated. Between angry mobs, midnight rescues, and recalcitrant sheep, they battle (figuratively) their way across the countryside, defend themselves against enemies old and new, and discover something remarkable hidden in the mountains of Wales.*

I enjoyed this book though not nearly as much as the first book in this series. That was because the first book was about Ms. Percy rethinking and changing her life as dragons become a part of her life.

This is less that, and more of a travel log rather than ‘my life is changing’ book and because of that, things like the writing style are more intrusive. I liked, just not as much.

9/10 for the 1st book, 7.5/10 for this one.

**Thoughts**

I read these and am very glad I did this and am a fan of SPFBO. I also have a job that keeps me in the car 30+ hours a week. So 21 of 25 books were audio books. I sometimes picked books in part because there was an audio version available.

I think if I were to do this again I would try to branch and and fit more physical/kindle books. I think I would switch out some books.

Do I think the quality of books increased/decreased from entries to semi-finalist to finalists, but it was uneven, and there were entries that I liked more than some semi-finalists and some semi-finalists I liked more than finalists. I was surprised to find that my favorite read (Gunmetal Gods) was ‘merely’ a semi finalist.

Among the finalists, they came out as close but ‘not quite’ in order. I chose two finalists from the bottom and the middle permanent rankings (Out of Nowhere and A Touch of Light respectively) and they were near the bottom of my rankings that had four 8+ scores and three SPFBO winners. The seven 7+ scorers were the true wild cards with me disliking one, respecting but not liking another, and the final two being decent but not world shaking.

**Finally, congratulations to every entry in SPFO. You’ve done something I’m struggling to do, which is finishing and publishing a novel. That is an achievement.**

**Book Guide:**

**Finding Books You Like, General Guidaince:**

1. Find judges your taste aligns with, know which judges you learn your tastes does not align with.
2. Know your special interests. I love it when characters don’t feel like moderns in setting dress, I love life or death stakes, I love heroes in difficult circumstances. But there are smaller things I like; things such as children being put into cross-cultural settings, people who are living a normal life, complexity.

In the finals books and teams made up of multiple judges, books seem to fall into one of three categories for me. They are:

*Consistent:*

Typical Scores Are-

8 (The judge that nominated them), 7, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 8.5, 9, 8, 7.5

This could mostly 8’s or all 7s, but maybe with one or two outliers, all scores are 1-2 points apart and this is the category that has every winner, and if you read an something where all scores are between 8-9.5, it’s probably great. If you read books that averaged between 6.5-8, and a final score of 7.2, maybe, maybe not. Consult your own taste for advice.

The other two categories are more interesting.

*One Judge Wonders:*

Typical scores are-

8.5 (the judge that nominated them), 7, 7, 6, 6, 5.5, 6, 7, 6.5, 6.5.

There were a lot more 4s thrown out in the early contests. I don’t know if the judges have gotten better at choosing or more circumspect when they think the other judge’s choice is not up to snuff.

Score where one judge likes a book and doesn’t quite align with the other judges. You should look at these if your taste tends to match with the judge in question or you have another reason.

For example, you’ve read something by the author or the subject matter aligns with your interests or some other reason.

For example, I love when fictional children are kidnapped (Uthred forever!) and so I’m still planning on reading Daughter of the Beast. I may read Tethered Spirits (final score 6.60) from SPFBO 8 because I trust Becky M’s taste and I’ve read TA Hernadez’s SPFBO 6 Semi-Finalist Calico Thunder Rides Again. That’s two upvotes.

Still, these seem to be near the bottom of finalist board every year.

*Split Decisions:*

Typical Scores-

9 (the judge that nominated them), 9.5, 9.5, 6, 5, 5.5, 7, 8, 8, 8.5

These books, arguably, are the books that end up in 2-4th place, but in many cases a lot of people are still talking about them 2-3 years later. There is a good reason for this. The judges that gave them a 5 have gone away, while the judges that gave the books 9’s are giving glowing reviews to the sequels for the next 2-4 years and have gotten other book tubers/reviewers/redditors to talk about them.

I feel this is the largest growing group of books because of judge turnover. There is simply less consensus about what is’ good’ then there was a few years ago. It is also the most promising.

If you find a book that scores a 9.0 for you, you’ve found the book that makes you weak in the knees in utter book lust, so much they tell their significant other “leave me alone, I’m reading”. They seduce, keeping them up until 4 AM, entranced.

Some examples from the last few years: Legacy of The Brightwash by Krystle Matar, Miss Percy’s Guide by Quenby Olsen, Scales and Sensibility by Stephanine Burgis, Hills of Heather and Bone by KE Andrews in SPFBO9 looks like a likely candidate at time of writing.

There are a lot of smart and distinct ideas, characters of types we don’t see often enough that may match up with your special interests or fill a specific niche.

**Why You Should Look For Books Among The Starting Entries:**

About forty percent of the books are simply not ready, needing an another or a few passes past a beta reader or otherwise could professional help to their book better. The reviews for the books make it clear.

But lets look at a couple books that got good reviews.

There are lots of books among these 300 where, in an alternate universe, the author is finalist and basking in publicity and sales as an SPFBO finalist.

[Rada](https://fantasybookcritic.blogspot.com/2023/08/spfbo-9-fourth-diminution-semifinalist.html) lost out to an eventual finalist, The Last Ranger and reading the review it is clear it was close. I probably would have chosen Rada. It has a six-year-old protagonist for god’s sake.

[Gods of the Deep](https://runesnielsen.com/author/author-interviews/2022/5/28/author-interview-drew-montgomery) by Drew Montgomery is an ecological fantasy. It got a good review which I remember but couldn’t find because my google-fu is weak.

Either of these might the thing that interests you.

Here are a list of other books the piqued my interest, and may pique yours. I haven’t read them, but they may be your one judge wonder or ‘almost’ Semi Finalist. A couple I have heard about post contest with reviewers I trust. But they are:

Starlight Jewel by E.L. Lyons

A Thing Immortal by Barry K. Gregory

Lady of Ravensmere by Mary Mckenna

Rada by Tracy M. Joyce

The Vow that Twisted Fate by Katherine D. Graham

Beneath the Lanterns by C. Litka

Gods of the Deep by Drew Montgomery

Night Demon by Stehen Wolberius

**Picking Books From Among the Semi-Finalists and why you shouldn’t limit your searches to finalists:**

First of all, [Zack Argyle](https://www.zackargyle.com/spfbo-9) gives you a good website to look at them.

Secondly, the finals are the survivors of ten different elimination competitions. And in spite of there being [Senlin safety net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3T5iJRmEPc&t=229s) option that judges should probably use more often (Yes judges, if you're sending a finalist and your book doesn't score an 8.5, consider it you saying you don’t believe it has a shot, because 8.65 is what it took five times to win and victory under 8 has happened once). These books are winners of ten contests of thirty, not one contest of 300. Like any sports tournament where there are freak results, one ‘bracket’ which is full of lots of weaker options and other brackets with a lot of strong options.

Going through my Semi-finalist reads, five of six books could easily be finalists and I think my semi-finalist winner has an 8+ score in an alternate universe.

1712623560.0,A Song of Ice and Fire (Finished Theory),"I am very convinced that GRRM finished A Song of Ice and Fire, but his ending was similar to that of the show and now he does not want to release the books because he doesn’t want to face the same backlash. Either he is completely rewriting his ending which is what is taking him so long, or he’s waiting to have them released after he passes away, so the community cannot attack him like the show was attacked (I believe the show ending was terrible), and it makes sense that George would tell the show runners how his series ended, he probably was not expecting that backlash.

Furthermore, the twenty-two slots are divided.  Six of my bingo squares are from the SPFBO9 300 original entries and were mostly read when that section of the competition was active, from which I nominate an unofficial book bingo “Semi-Finalist”. Six Semi-Finalists from various years filled six other bingo slots, from which I pick one “Bingo Finalist”, where were I a judge, I would advance to the finals. Finally, I read ten books that made the finals including three winners, and rated them, giving them scores and picking my favorite from among them.

This is divided in two because reddit limits us to 400,000 characters.

Without Further Ado,

**Row 1:**

**Title With A Title:** Fortune’s Fool by Angela Brood

**SPFBO Standing:** SPFBO 5 Runner Up

*Once played as a pawn in a deadly game of feuding Houses, Kyrra d’Aliente now makes her living in male guise as the ruthless mercenary Kyris di Nada. Yet hidden beneath her tough exterior lies a woman driven by one thing: the belief that her lost love, killed in the war he fought on her behalf, is still alive. But when Kyrra is offered the chance to assassinate the man who betrayed her, the seductive song of revenge changes everything.*

*In a world of scheming gods and precarious loyalties, vengeance comes at a deadly cost. As the treacherous web of her past tries to trap her once again, Kyrra must make a choice: kill the man who stole everything from her, or risk everything to save the man she loves.*

This book follows Kyrra from a naïve and somewhat stupid heir to a noble family to her life as a mercenary swordswoman. This mixes gods, an Italian Renaissance inspired setting that feels like a more brutal version of the World of the Five Gods.

Kyrra evolves in this series of present day and flash backs, as she pieces together the destruction of her family. Punches are not pulled and not everything is known, and the man who has guided her through her transformation also has some huge secrets that even he doesn’t know.

This is the best book if you want to combine grimdark and romance (Grimantasy?). That is not an easy feat to achieve.

8.5/10

**Superhero:** Wayfarer by K.M. Weiland

**SPFBO Standing:** SPFBO 6 Semi-Finalist, from Booknest

*Think being a superhero is hard? Try being the first one.*

*Will’s life is a proper muddle—and all because he was “accidentally” inflicted with the ability to run faster and leap higher than any human ever. One minute he’s a blacksmith’s apprentice trying to save his master from debtor’s prison. The next he’s accused of murder and hunted as a black-hearted highwayman.*

*A vengeful politician with dark secrets and powers even more magical than Will’s has duped all of London into blaming Will for the chilling imprisonments of the city’s poor. The harder Will tries to use his abilities to fight crime, the deeper he is entangled in a dark underworld belonging to some of Georgian England’s most colorful characters.*

*Only Will stands a chance of stopping this powerful madman bent on “reforming” London by any means necessary. Unfortunately, Will is beginning to realize becoming a legend might mean sacrificing everything that matters.*

This book was original, smart, and very much felt like a ‘First’ superhero setting, only with the distinction of being set in 1820s England. Lots of details work, for example, I love how the class distinctions between Will and his love interest and Will and his enemy are not swept under the rug and are important to the plot. Characters are likable and well-developed.

Overall, this is a story that’s slightly feels like the first installment to superhero universe. Sadly, there is no sequel, even though there is plenty of sequel bait at the end.

8/10

**Bottom of my TBR:** A Handful of Souls by Stephen Rice

**SPFBO Standing:** SPFBO 7 Semi-Finalist from Booknest

*Mud, gold and lies. That's all you get in Branera. You'll find no better expert on these things than Lily Kale-Tollworth. Yet she has no clue of the events already in motion around her.*

*Weeks ago, a murderer with a bleeding grin was released from the Mountain Head. Lily doesn't know this pale-skinned giant has been writing to her. She doesn't even know he's coming to find her. But as her father, Husker Tollworth feels like it's his right.*

*Days ago, a tax patrol was slaughtered. Lily doesn't know her brother's corpse was pulled from a ditch, stolen by a man who can raise the dead. Lark Kale-Tollworth will follow this bizarre scholar to the Southlands. He will forget how many times he's died.*

*Hours ago, an informant showed Lily's stepfather an incriminating note. Branera has taxed its villages too hard. An uprising is massing in the Northlands - and they have a noose with Josef Kale's name on it.*

*At this very moment, Josef is frantically packing their coach, while Lily is drinking whisky in a brothel. She's met the arrogant idiot who will be their guide south. She doesn't know he has a hollow soul, filled with thousands of spirits. She doesn't know his mouth is filled with as many lies.*

*But if there are three things Lily's good at, it's mud, gold and lies.*

This is the story of the Kale-Tollworth family and feels like regency industrial creepy in a good way, rather like Joe Abercrombie’s Age of Madness, but not quite that high on the social ladder. This is intimate, family-level social disruption and chaos.

We get several viewpoints, Lilly who drinks to much, Lark who has been killed and resurrected by a necromancer, their father Husker who has just gotten out of prison for murder, and Dren and all parts are fully realized.

Overall, this is an 8/10.

**Historical Setting (Substitution for Magical Realism):** Werewolf of Whitechapel by Suzannah Rowntree

**SPFBO Standing:** SPFBO 9 Semi-Finalist, almost finalist from The Weatherwax Report/Critiquing Chemist

*A killer stalks the grimy streets of Whitechapel—but Scotland Yard seems determined to turn a blind eye. With one look at her best friend's corpse, Liz Sharp already knows the truth: the killer is a werewolf.*

*No one important will hold a werewolf accountable—after all, the monsters rule Europe. Certainly, no one will believe a werewolf victim like Liz: the very scars that make her determined to investigate Sal’s death also condemn her as the sort of female who’d sell her blood for easy money.*

*As it happens, Liz’s best hope for justice might well lie with her emotionally repressed employer, Princess May. Though the princess has connections with werewolf royalty, there’s no one else Liz can turn to. Certainly, she can’t risk trusting the irritatingly personable Inspector Short, who dogs her steps from the slums of Whitechapel to the palaces of St James.*

*But as corpses mount up, Liz discovers that no one is precisely who she thought: not Sal, not herself, and certainly not the werewolf.*

Set in an the late 1800s where most of European Royalty are vampires, werewolves and whatever else, including (secretly, the British Royal Family) Ms. Sharpe is a former werewolf victim, current amnesic, who has spent the last few years training as a bodyguard/ladies maid.

Rowntree does a great job with this intriguing world, setting up the school, the employment, the status and powers of various royal families and mixing it with the details of Whitechapel. The first two-thirds were highly enjoyable and would rate much higher. However, the final third had a lot of ‘jump the shark’ moments involving British Royals being much too differential to a newly hired servant.

If you don’t think this last part will bother you as much, I highly recommend it.

**Young Adult:** Regen/Regerate by Cassie Gruetman

**SPFBO Standing:** SPFBO 9 Entry, reviewed twice by Covers With Cassidy (Shout out to Cassidy for allowing two sub-judges to review each book)

*After years of being shoved from home to home, sixteen-year-old Trisha Penchant finally found a foster family that she won’t admit she loves. Life is looking up. Until the night she wakes up in the woods covered in blood.*

*Her supernatural ability saved her life. But it put her on the radar of the Faerie Council, who give her an ultimatum. Catch an escaped fugitive, or be taken to Faerie, a place her missing mother told her horror stories about. Trying to appease the Council, keeping her powers hidden from her foster parents, and learning to work with the ex-boyfriend who killed her, Trisha's brushes with death are on the rise.*

*Pushed to the brink, she struggles to walk a fine line of doing what’s right, and doing what’s necessary.Her choices will change lives. Forever.*

This is a perfectly decent, and professional YA book that I think is typical of a lot of books that get a half paragraph from various sub-judges and are then quickly passed over. Trisha is a Faerie who has been part of the foster care system. Before that she traveled around with her faerie mother as a fugitive.

The problem with this book is that while it doesn’t do anything particularly badly, it doesn’t do anything particularly well. The faerie feel remarkably mundane, Trisha doesn’t feel like a foster kid, and the foster parents she supposedly bonds with after evading their questions don’t seem a little too good to be true.

**Row 2**

**Mundane Jobs**: Out Of Nowhere by Patrick LeClerc

**SPFBO Standing:** Finalist SPFBO 4

*Healer Sean Danet is immortal—a fact he has cloaked for centuries, behind enemy lines and now a paramedic’s uniform. Having forgotten most of his distant past, he has finally found peace—and love. But there are some things you cannot escape, however much distance you put behind you. When Sean heals the wrong man, he uncovers a lethal enemy who holds all the cards. And this time he can’t run. It’s time to stand and fight, for himself, for his friends, for the woman he loves. It’s time, finally, for Sean to face his past—and choose a future. A story of love, of battle—and of facing your true self when there’s nowhere left to hide.*

This is the story of Sean, an EMT who just happens to be an immortal with a healing factor. He moves around on a regular basis and changes his names every few years, i.e. the standard immortal story we’ve seen. He is old enough to have no memory of his origin, which allows for a very non-specific background and very vaguely Slavic feeling criminals who know who he is and begin to hunt him. He eventually deals with this threat with a Highlander style duel and a pledge to stay out of the drug trade said criminals deal with locally.

If this story has a flaw, it’s that Sean is simply someone who, though he cares about his immediate friends, has no heroic pretensions and very little reason for us to cheer for him other than being the designated protagonist.

Some readers may also be put off by the language. It uses very contemptuous descriptions of gays, trans, and cops (and probably a few others I’ve forgotten) but which are keeping with the blue color, urban subculture of the setting. This may be off putting to some readers.

**2000s:** A Donkey, A Stablehand, and An Empire

**SPFBO Standing:** Entrée, SPFBO 9 entry, reviewed by Fantasy Book Critic

*Carson Barker certainly doesn't think so, and appoints himself into the unenviable role of imperial translator.*

*However, it isn't going to be an easy ride. With assassins, blood-thirsty fishmongers and furious homemakers around every corner, each seeking to be the first to kill the new regent and seize the throne for themselves, Carson finds himself squarely in the firing line by association.*

*Little do they know this is no ordinary donkey, and the future of the Empire, possibly even the world, rests on Carson's ability to keep this extraordinary animal alive.*

*Will he manage to save his ass? Find out in the witty and action-packed book one of the Three Crowns series.*

The people of Ostera find themselves saddled with a new, Regent, known as Regent Donkey the First - keeper of the lands through 'right of conquest' until another takes his place -accepting a stablehand as 'official translator'**.**

Story comes down to whether you want to kill the ass or save the ass, and whether being ruled by an ass is being any different than being ruled by a human.

It also manages to be short, so the jokes don’t get stale.

This book manages fun in a Monty Python Sort of way with and underlying Pratchett sort of thoughtful/serious.

8/10

**Angels And Demons:** Small Miracles by Olivia Atwater

**SPFBO Standing:** Winner, SPFBO 8

*Gadriel, the fallen angel of petty temptations, has a bit of a gambling debt. Fortunately, her angelic bookie is happy to let her pay off her debts by doing what she does best: All Gadriel has to do is tempt miserably sinless mortal Holly Harker to do a few nice things for herself.*

*What should be a cakewalk of a job soon runs into several roadblocks, however, as Miss Harker politely refuses every attempt at temptation from Gadriel the woman, Gadriel the man, and Gadriel the adorable fluffy kitten. When even chocolate fails to move Gadriel’s target, the ex-guardian angel begins to suspect she’s been conned. But Gadriel still remembers her previous job… and where petty temptations fail, small miracles might yet prevail.*

SPFBO 8 winner and a deserving one, though not my top choice. This is a nice feel-good story that is short and touching. Gadriel is likeable as a relatively good demon whose only crime is doubting God. The other protagonist is Holly, who has too much on her plate with her niece, daughter of her late sister whom she had very little in common.

Atwater deliberately modeled this book on the late Terry Pratchett and so the tone varies from light on the surface, but with a deeper meaning built-in and in this sense it works. The character work is excellent and the plot is well thought out.

I had the misfortune of getting the audio version which has since been removed from sale, it was so bad. But fortunately, I finished the PDF. This is one book where format really matters.

8.5/10

**Five Short Stories:**

All taken from the Anthology Alchemy of Sorrow, Edited by Sarah Chorn which features stories dealing with grief and loss and is highly recommended. I divided the 13 stories between this and my standard bingo card. The five I chose for this are—

A Matter of Trust by Angela Brood

The Witch in the Woods by Quenby Olsen

Death in The Uncanny Valley by M.L. Wang

Summer Souls by Clayton Snyder

The Paperweight Watch by Krystle Matar

Favorites were A Matter of Trust, about a divorced mercenary who finds healing through helping a mother with her young children. The Paperweight Watch, about a young man seeing to his deceased parents business through interactions with the employees of his family business that he’ll not be involved with on a regular basis.

My ultimate favorite was Thicker Than Water by Carol Park, about a young man labeled an evil sorcerer who sees his parents and siblings turn on him and has to start over.

9/10

**Horror:** Patronus by Dyrk Ashton

**SPFBO Standing:** SPFBO 2 Finalist

*When a local hospital is attacked by strange and frightening men, Fiona Patterson and Zeke Prisco save a catatonic old man named Peter—and find themselves running for their lives with creatures beyond imagination hounding their every step.*

*With nowhere else to turn, they seek out Fi’s enigmatic Uncle Edgar. But the more their questions are answered, the more they discover that nothing is what it seems—not Peter, not Edgar, perhaps not even themselves.*

*The gods and monsters, heroes and villains of lore—they’re real. And now they’ve come out of hiding to hunt their own. In order to survive, Fi and Zeke must join up with powerful allies against an ancient evil that’s been known by many names and feared by all. The final battle of the world’s oldest war has begun.*

This is a book that is about mythology, all of them, Odin, Lancelot, the Minotaur, Baphomet, Quetzalcoatl, Ganesha, and is one of those books is hard to describe and very good.

And it starts all very normal, except for some strange cuts to Asia Minor which involve the Minotaur. Fi works in a nursing home, Zeke is a few years older and volunteers as a musician. They are starting to date, and pretty soon they’re under siege in said nursing home from supernatural baddies.

They’re all going after a senile patient at the nursing home. He happens to be God, but he’s senile so they can’t ask his help at first. This is very much horror at first, then it becomes weird Urban Fantasy, but this is not the Urban Fantasy of sexy vampires, but scary and stisturbing fever dream with real stakes.

There are some flaws. The power dynamic changes when Peter, the old man/god wakes up and the ending seems inevitable. The book feels like it was written by a guy who was eighteen in about 1975. But these are minor drawbacks.

8/10

**Row 3**

**Self Publish or Indie Publisher:** Steal The Sun by SM Carter

**SPFBO Standing:** SPFBO 9 Entry Reviewed by Domish Books for Team Bookborn.

Domish also gets my award for best ‘sub-judge’.

*When Raik, the most cunning smuggler this side of the desert, finds where the Ivory King vaults his magical runes—he builds a crew to execute an elaborate heist.*

*Among them is Kahli Mahanta, a religious assassin with blind ambition. A young rogue, Kirin, with wit sharper than his arrows ought to be. And Amara, the so-called Nightspirit, whose raven-hair conceals even darker secrets.*

*It won't be easy. They’re opposed by the curved blades of the magic-deranged, watched by a paranoid king, and hunted by gaunt beasts that click in the cold desert night... All the while discovering that trusting each other might be the most dangerous mission of all.*

*To Steal The Sun is a tale of unlikely heroes thrust together in a new refreshing fantasy. One cast in vibrant silks, fragrant spice, and the relentless glare of a radiant sun.*

Steal the Sun is a heist, and it works. This is a very interesting Middle Eastern inspired world. I didn’t love it by I did enjoy it, but I think learned that the semi-D&D party isn’t my thing.

What worked was the Rune magic system and issues of addiction to magic. Characters were enjoyable  but didn't blow me away. Seven months later, I am having minimal interest in this book and struggling to recall the details.

That says something there, one which is I should take better notes.

6/10

**Set In the Middle East:** Gunmetal Gods by Zamil Aktar

**SPFBO Standing:** SPFBO 7 Semi-finalist and last eliminated by Fantasy Book Critic

*They took his daughter, so Micah comes to take their kingdom. Fifty thousand gun-toting paladins march behind him, all baptized in angel blood, thirsty to burn unbelievers.*

*Only the janissaries can stand against them. Their living legend, Kevah, once beheaded a magus amid a hail of ice daggers. But ever since his wife disappeared, he spends his days in a haze of hashish and poetry.*

*To save the kingdom, Kevah must conquer his grief and become the legend he once was. But Micah writes his own legend in blood, and his righteous conquest will stop at nothing.*

*When the gods choose sides, a legend will be etched upon the stars.*

The fact that this book has done very well since being eliminated says a lot.

First thing you need to know that this book is grimdark. How dark? Well, there is a scene about a third in that is darker than the Red Wedding. There is a wonderful/horrible detail involving horses that is necessary to save their lives, but diminishes them.

Yet all the Grimdark is like this, not banal, but understandable from the PoV being described. It is never grim for grims sake.

Plus there is lots more going on, from rival royal courts modeled on Turkish and Byzantine courts, women who are products of sexist societies that perfectly balance being products of such societies yet also being ‘strong’, fully realized people. There are nomads and merchants. There is a very good romance and lots of stakes. Religions that are modeled on Sunni Islam and Orthodox Christianity yet are their own thing.

This is one of the two most fully realized SPFBO reads in creating a worlds that closely resembles a historical societies well. It is up there with the likes of Guy Gavriel Kay in that regard.

Only concern other than the grimdark, is that one two main PoV is a straight-out villain. The other is a flawed protagonist on a redemption arc. Some may find him too flawed to cheer for. If so, this book might not be for you.

9.5/10, and I very much considered a 10. Not only my favorite Semi Finalist, but the best book on this card.

**Published in 2023:** Mountain of Souls By Marcus Lee

**SPFBO Standing:** SPFBO 9 Entry, reviewed by Phillip Chase

*Within the depths of the Mountain of Souls, orphans are raised to be remorseless assassins. Abandoned by a society ravaged by endless war and greed, hundreds die during selection so that a determined few, honed by training and enchantment, can ascend to join The Chosen.*

*Malina is one of those orphans.*

*Cursed with yellow eyes and deathly pale skin, she is neither popular nor strong and is certain to die on her first day, broken and forgotten like so many before her.*

*Fate, however, has other, far more reaching plans for Malina than a quick death. The return of The Once and Future King is imminent, The Chosen are pivotal to his ascension, and no two destinies have ever been more intricately entwined.*

*Yet what happens if the path laid out before her is not the one she decides to take?*

I have read this entire trilogy, so I liked the book and I recommend the series.

This book follows Malina, an orphan girl bought by a cult of snake people. Hundreds are bought, ten survive, including Malina, and gradually she and her fellow survivors are brainwashed and trained to be assasins for this cult, servants of the Once and Future King whose return is imminent and will bring about world of equality for all humanity.

Yet Malina has something within her, that suggests that being an assasin might be a bad thing, yet her brainwashing keeps her from straight out wondering ‘are we the baddies?’ and Lee does a great job of making us sympathize with our brainwashed cultists.

This is my “Semi-Finalist” from my Six SPFBO reads.

8/10

**Multiverses:** Thirteenth Hour by Trudie Skies

**SPFBO Standing:** SPFBO 8 Runner Up

*Cruel gods rule the steam-powered city of Chime, demanding worship and tribute from their mortal subjects. Kayl lost her faith in them long ago, and now seeks to protect vulnerable and downtrodden mortals from their gods’ whims. But when Kayl discovers powers that she didn’t know she had—and destroys a mortal’s soul by accident—she becomes Chime’s most wanted.*

*Quen’s job was to pursue sinners, until the visions started. Haunted by foreboding images of his beloved city’s destruction, Quen hunts soul-sucking creatures made of aether who prey on its citizens—and Kayl is his number one target.*

*To ensure Chime’s future, Kayl and Quen must discover the truth of Kayl’s divine abilities before the gods take matters into their own hands.*

*For a city that bows to cruel gods, it’ll take godless heathens to save it.*

This is the only book I read twice. Once when SPFBO8 was winding down and again at the end of March to see if it was as good as I remembered.

I liked it more the second time.

First off, this setting contains no humans. Instead, twelve races with different abilities created by twelve gods on twelve worlds inhabit Chime, which is centered around a gate that spends an hour connected to each world twice daily, allowing for comrence and transport.

Every race is equal, only some races are more equal than others. Every god demands a tithe from the people they’ve created and some can be quite merciless if that tithe is not met.

Everyone vanishes when they die, going back to their god. Only, now, sometimes, they are not, the soul utterly destroyed.

Kayl has two problems. First she is a member of the Godless, and underground movement that wishes to be free of their Gods, committing the twin sins of blasphemy and apostacy. She has also accidently killed her employer and destroyed her soul, and she has no idea how she did that.

Quen is a Warden (i.e. Cop) tasked with capturing her, the other Godless, only he has some secrets. I am making this book sound complicated and boring.

It is snarky, sexy, beautifully anti-authoritarian, complicated in a way that balances wildly imaginative with easy to keep track of. We are get excerpts from dossiers and Godless tracts at the start of each chapter. We are exposed to every species in this setting and every one of them comes alive.

Also, Quen and Kayl are genuinely good likable people in difficult circumstances. They are easy to cheer for and the stakes they face are real.

The only ‘flaw’ in this book may be tied to why you read fantasy. If you read in hopes of sometimes having your mind blown, this is the book for you. If you read it because you like predictable tropes and familiar settings, you will find less of that here.

9.5/10 my champion of finalists and 2nd place overall on this card.

**POC Author:** The Dragon Charmers Apprentice by JC Kang

**SPFBO Standing:** SPFBO 8 Semi-Finalist from Queens Book Asylum

*A slave shall rise from the ashes to master dragons.*

*Born into slavery, Mai's horizons are limited to one simple desire: to catch the eye of a handsome mate. She dares not dream for more, for like all humans, she’s been taught from birth that her life belongs to the orcs, her destiny to serve.*

*But her world is upended when Aralas, a messenger from the elf gods, reveals blasphemous truths: humanity was created to be free; and hope—if it can be called that—lies in the jaws of the dragon Avarax, whom only Mai can charm with her unique voice.*

*Torn, overwhelmed, desperate to hope yet terrified of failing her kind, Mai has until a rare conjunction of moons to master magic that takes lifetimes to learn. Yet how will she discover who she really is when even her allies seek to control her?*

*Only by making the greatest of sacrifices will she manifest the power of a Dragon Song, and help mankind escape eternal servitude.*

Standard, free the already conquered world story with an Asian theme. Okay, not very original but I’m intrigued. Mai is taken to a hidden village to be trained as a singer/dragon charmer by Aralas, an ‘Elf-Angel’ a centuries old magical teacher who helps his various students improve their skills. This set up is convincing, in a very YA sort of way. It works out predicably well.

Then we get to why I can genuinely recommend five out six semi-finalists and this is number six.

>!All of Aralas’ mostly female students have slept with their centuries-old teacher, said teacher tells Mai that such a liaison is inevitable, and enhances magical abilities.!<

Just a hard no. 2/10. Please pass the brain bleach.

[https://beforewegoblog.com/five-kindle-unlimited-recommendations-for-april-2024/](https://beforewegoblog.com/five-kindle-unlimited-recommendations-for-april-2024/)

Kindle Unlimited is a service that can theoretically provide you with limitless numbers of books for the price of one normal release every month. This is a tremendous blessing for those of us who are fast readers. I pretty much have read every single Red Sonja comic ever written thanks to Dynamite Entertainment putting almost all their comics on the service.

However, what we here at Before We Go want most is good Kindle Unlimited books. As such, here is a recommendation of a bunch of entertaining ones that I’ve enjoyed and can say rise above the dross.

# 1. She Dreams of Fire by MK Gibson

*She Dreams of Fire* is an excellent urban fantasy story about a medical doctor who is a serial killer, a cannibalistic talking rabbit, and a young woman raised by two monsters from Greek Mythology. They hunt witches. Only bad witches, though, which are distressingly common as they have killed all the good ones. There's a mixture of darkness and humor in this story which is just right for those of us who are fans of the Dresden Files and Mercy Thompson.

I admit I like this one primarily because it's just a very entertaining lighthearted Buffy-esque story that also does the early seasons of Buffy thing where it suddenly zig-zags into horrible traumatizing stuff. The whiplash is entirely purposeful and a lot of fun. While I prefer the author's Technomancer and Villain's Rule books, I think this is a really entertaining one as well.

**About** ***She Dreams of Fire***

*Agatha “Aggy” Grae was only 10 years old the night a witch of the Umbra Coven killed her mother and burned her home. Injured, she received a transfusion of blood tainted by witchcraft, and immediately her eyes opened to the truths hidden from mundane eyes.*

*She saw a new world, a hidden world, one filled with darkness and secrets. And that new world was now aware of her.*

*Through the years, Aggy never quit hunting the mysterious coven. From the shadows she gathered information, stepping out only to hurt those who dared to hurt others. But everything changed the night she helped a familiar looking stranger.*

*Through magical means, Vanessa, a high witch of the Umbra Coven, has learned of Aggy. Following the orders of the coven's leader, The Veiled One, Vanessa has begun her own hunt, one that can end only with Aggy's blood.*

*She Dreams of Fire is a story of strength. In order to survive, Aggy must defeat her own doubts, addictions, and fears. In order to win, she has to endure everything the witches and the Hidden Folk throw at her. Partnered with a man from her past, the unlikely pair must learn to trust each other as they suffer betrayal, discover hidden truths about themselves, and battle the monsters in the dark. But does Aggy have the strength to walk through the fire?*

# 2. Dragon Heist by Alexander C. Kane

[Review](https://beforewegoblog.com/audiobook-review-dragon-heist-by-alexander-c-kane/)

Alexander C. Kane's writings are some of the funniest ones on Kindle Unlimited and if you haven't tried his Andrea Vernon series then you're missing out. However, Dragon Heist may be even funnier and I strongly recommend anyone who hasn't listened to it to give it a try. This is a book that works wonderfully on the page but if you have an extra audiobook credit then I suggest using it instead as the narrator makes it even better.

The premise is that the Earth has been taken over by dragons but they haven't really impacted the Earth much other than saying they're in charge and taking the lions (err, dragons) share of all the precious metals in the world. Tuscaloosa, Alabama is too small for a dragon but one shows up anyway and adopts a failed child actress turned cartoon voice actor as his mouthpiece. They're going to rob the dragons of Tennessee!

**About** ***Dragon Heist***

*The world’s smallest dragon and a washed-up actress team up to strike a blow for humanity in this brand-new adventure by the author of the ""Andrea Vernon"" and ""Orlando People"" series.Birdie Binkowitz is just a little bitter. As a young actress, she was the toast of Hollywood, definitely destined for greatness. Then the dragons had to rise up from their thousand-year slumber, take over Earth and ruin everything. Twenty years later, Birdie is living her worst life in her hometown of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, working at her father's Seed and Feed (and Bagels).*

*Then, a mysterious dragon appears in front of the store seeking her help. He’s got a bone to pick with his fellow dragons–and he wants to hit them where it hurts.*

*Birdie and Jim the Dragon will need to put together a team with a fighter, a mage, a thief, and a giant to pull off a daring heist. If they succeed, they might change the world.*

*Or at least get Birdie an agent.*

# 3. Star Risk Ltd by Chris Bunch

The late Chris Bunch was one of my favorite writers and I really enjoyed his books when they were traditionally published. I was pleased to see that they've since been put up on Kindle Unlimited. Star Risk Ltd us is one of my favorite humorous sci-fi series and that is high praise if you know anything about me. It is a story about a group of *A-Team*-esque group of oddballs and specialists who form a mercenary company to do weird jobs in SPACE. This includes going after a bunch of terrorists/pirates who are making a mining colony into a hellhole for the locals. Can you guess there's corporate greed involved?

**What is** ***Star Risk***?

*For the right price, they’ll go anywhere in the galaxy. They’ll do anything, fight anyone, face any danger.*

*M’chel Riss was stagnating in the Alliance Marines, assigned to a desolate post in the middle of nowhere. Then a fortuitous chance brought her to the attention of Star Risk, Ltd., a ragtag bunch of misfits struggling to make a living. Their first mission: spring a dangerous super-soldier trapped in a maximum security prison.*

*For money, fame, glory . . . mostly money.*

# 4. Crackle and Fire: An Angela Hardwicke Sci-Fi Mystery by Russ Colchamiro

[Review](https://beforewegoblog.com/review-crackle-and-fire-an-angela-hardwicke-sci-fi-mystery-by-russ-colchamiro/)

I'm a huge fan of film noir and detective fiction, so combining it with a surreal cross-dimensional *Planescape*-esque dystopia was right up my alley. Angela Hardwicke is a great character and one that I very much appreciate the very human flaws of. As an ex-drug addict and single mother, she's someone who is trying to rebuild her life in this story even as she's driven to solve the murder out of a misguided sense that it will bring her redemption. Good stuff!

**What is Crackle and Fire?**

*""Russ Colchamiro has staked out a territory uniquely his own: Angela Hardwicke is a science fictional female PI and damn good at what she does. He mines a vein of pulp fiction gold that's all his. Let's hope he doesn't walk away from the table."" --Nicholas Meyer, writer/director, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan*

*Part Blade Runner, part Doctor Who, part Sarah Connor, Angela Hardwicke isn’t just any private eye.*

*She’s a PI from Eternity, the cosmic realm responsible for the design, creation, and maintenance of the Universe. When accountant Gil Haberseau hires her to find an intern with stolen corporate files, Hardwicke soon finds herself embroiled in a deadly case of lies, intrigue, and murder, clashing with vengeful gangsters, MinderNot rallies, and a madman who’s come a long way to get what he wants.*

*In Russ Colchamiro’s thrilling Sci-Fi mystery Crackle and Fire, Angela Hardwicke learns once and for all that when it comes to being an intergalactic private eye, there’s no telling what threats she may face on-realm and off… including the demons that lurk deep within her soul. Bonus story included! The AI-themed Angela Hardwicke murder mystery, “The Case of Jarlo’s Buried Treasure”*

# 5. Galactic Vice by Jake Bible

*It all starts with an interstellar cargo barge full of corpses…*

*The criminal scum of the galaxy have found a new playground and its name is Jafla Base. Now Galactic Vice Detective Etch Knowles has to infiltrate that playground before the criminal syndicates end up in all-out war.*

*Corruption on every level of government, brutal violence around every corner, alien races that consider humans the lowest of low, and a laser blaster always pointed at his back, Knowles needs Galactic Vice Lieutenant Angie McDade and Galactic Vice Detective Kalaka to back him up. Their job is to keep Knowles from getting his head blown off or die trying.*

*But there are forces at work that want nothing more than for Jafla Base to burn. And some of those forces may be coming from within the Jafla Base Vice Squad itself!*

*But when Maresi returns to her village, she realises all is not well - the people are struggling under the rule of the oppressive Earl, and people are too busy trying to survive to see the value of her teachings. Maresi finds she must use all the terrible force of the Crone's magic to protect her people, but can she find the strength to do so when her heart is weakening with love for the first time?*  
  
**What I Thought**  
  
The bad news is that there are no more Red Abbey books for me to read. The good news is that this was absolutely beautiful and powerful in the same way that each of the books in this series has been.  
  
Turtschaninoff truly excels at writing gorgeous descriptions of nature and what it is like to live in a deep relationship with nature. Everything from the changing seasons to Maresi’s tasks and chores, the quiet details of life in her village Rovas, the festivals and rituals and songs and the many descriptions of food is incredibly evocative and creates a strong sense of location and the beauty of daily life.  
  
Maresi is also a very strong character, and her story is one of standing up to injustice and making a positive change in her world that is immensely satisfying. People in her village judge her for being different and dismiss her attempts to build a school at first, but through what I’ve come to call “vindication catharsis,” she manages to show her community the power of education and bring her people together in a powerful, effective rebellion against tyranny.  
  
I love every bit of how she settles back into her home village, from becoming something of an idol and mentor to a girl who was assaulted to navigating her developing sexuality. I’m very fond of the man she ends up with, Karun, who has chosen gentleness and kindness instead of cruelty, takes her goals seriously when no one else does, and actually >!*builds her an entire school*!<*.* Interestingly, Maresi makes something of a fool of herself in the initial stages of getting to know him, partially because of how little experience she has had with men at the Abbey and how traumatic most of that experience has been. This is all written very well; I just wish that there had been more of their relationship.  
  
Her relationships with her family members are also really interesting, especially the way that different people have varying and complex feelings about her going away, coming back, and being so strange and educated when she returns. Maresi thinks that her mother resents her nonconformity but in reality, her mother is struggling between regret for having sent Maresi away and awe for her new power (which her mother recognizes before Maresi does). Her sister Naraes is jealous of Maresi and all the opportunities she got, and she gets incredibly angry when she feels that Maresi is squandering her learning and settling into an unremarkable life instead of pursuing her goals. Together her family and community face tragedy and loss and hardship, and together they make it through time and again. And in Maresi’s final letter back to the Abbey, written decades later, we see the amazing difference she has made in the lives of her loved ones and in her world. It is a beautiful ending to a beautiful book and a beautiful series, and I can only hope that Turtschaninoff’s upcoming works will be translated into English as well.",Fantasy
1712607348.0,Malice animal deaths,"Hi all, 

I'm currently about a third of the way through Malice. So far I am enjoying the series a lot; it is scratching a classic fantasy itch that had been bothering me for a while. However, there is one thing that's hampering my enjoyment so far: the unnecessary amount of animal deaths. Compared to the usual content of fantasy this might seem like a weird complaint, but it is a specific one of mine. Could anyone, without spoilers, let me know whether this keeps up or becomes better/worse? Thank you!",Fantasy

1712599103.0,[Review] Rival Most Vial by R.K. Ashwick (SPFBO-9 Finalist),"  

**I read this for SPFBO. My review only. More about the contest and links at the bottom.**

 

 **Rival Most Vial** is a nice little low stakes romantasy. It feels a little like a contemporary romance in a d&d setting.  It was sweet. It was funny. And it was cute (I mean look at that title for a clue). It had a great cast of characters surrounding our leads and a world full of everything from orcs to elves.

**Ambrose** is a bit of a stuffed shirt. He likes his shop quiet and orderly. He’s that uptight prickly character that’s burying a lot of hurt…and my favourite type, I might add.

**Elias** is a friendlier, messier personality, and it’s reflected in is shop. What I loved about Elias was that he also had concerns and worries but just copes differently than someone like Ambrose does.  
He’s not just there to be that person who brings Ambrose out of the darkness and shows him that he is worthy. Ambrose also does this for Elias. So, each of them has that something special that helps make the other feel whole- if that makes sense.

Rival Most Vial’s story revolves around them trying to outdo each other to gain customers to their potion shops, and eventually, for reasons they need to work together- allowing them to appreciate each other strengths, and use them to achieve their goals. In the meantime, loves happens. This pretty much follows romance formula and I ate it up with a spoon…I have an undying love for the enemies to lover’s trope. This was that, but more to the sweet side. I enjoyed it for it’s light humour and warmth, and that all-around easy feeling that just allows you to sit back and enjoy the story.

**Other thoughts**

I am not quite sure if I could wrap my head around Tom, I had a mental picture of a robotized ET crossed with something out of Inspector Gadget which is probably not what the author was going for but whatever she’s supposed to be, she was cute.

1712597169.0,My thoughts on The Luminous Dead & The Kaiju Preservation Society - my first 2 Bingo reads for 2024,"I just finished the second book for the 2024 Bingo and since I figured I might as well try to go for hero mode this year, here's some of my thoughts on them!

Spoilers for both books

**Prompt:** Under the Surface - hard mode

**Book:** Caitlin Starling - The Luminous Dead

**My rating:** 5*

**My thoughts:** >!This was a brilliant psychological sci-fi novel, connecting two unlikely women together through their need to find their mothers. It's brilliant, I loved the fact that 99% of the book we only have 2 characters interacting with each other, one on the surface and one deep within the cave system. I felt true terror at some points, which isn't something that's usually a problem in books for me, and didn't really know if the caver was truly experiencing things or just hallucinating them. 5 star read, I enjoyed it a LOT.!<

**Prompt:** Entitled Animals - hard mode

**Book:** John Scalzi - The Kaiju Preservation Society 

**My rating:** 4*

**My thoughts:** >!After the previous book, I wanted something lighter, and this one seemed like a perfect choice. It is very much a lighthearted, fun read, with just enough darkness at the edges to give you pause. However, I didn't enjoy this as much, and through the listening I realised why: there's too much modern slang and references used in it, phrases even I have used at times, and that's just a bit TOO contemporary for me. High fantasy, historical fantasy, sci-fi in the far future - give me. But contemporary just doesn't work for me, unless it's outdated 😂 but the story itself was really good, so I'd say this was a 4 star read. !<

I listened to both on audio, and both are outside of my usual scope of what I read, so I'd say it's a win!

1712595317.0,Lost Cargo (Get Lost #2) by Noah Chinn - More zany space smuggler fun 5/5,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j18dgna7catc1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc86549b59c17d8019d9716eb497a27262e53b5d

[https://beforewegoblog.com/review-lost-cargo-get-lost-2-by-noah-chinn/](https://beforewegoblog.com/review-lost-cargo-get-lost-2-by-noah-chinn/)

Noah Chinn is one of the voices of indie science fiction that doesn't get nearly the attention he deserves. I primarily know him from his reviews in KNIGHTS OF THE DINNER TABLE MAGAZINE but really enjoyed LOST SOULS by him. He invented a fantastic light-hearted space opera story about a smuggler, his AI starship, and a runaway slave in a well-designed setting where Earth has been destroyed. 

The sequel has the premise of affable criminal, Moss, planning to do some good natured piracy under the lie of rescuing a bunch of slaves. Unfortunately for Moss, he discovers that the actual cargo is not something easily turned into profit.. Driven by a combination of guilt and anger from his crewmates, he must find a solution even as they're hunted by the cyborg armies of Earth.

Meanwhile, Roy Herzog, a cybernetic super soldier that was thwarted in kidnapping a bunch of colonists in the previous book, has set his sights on avenging himself on Moss. It's not his primary goal and I appreciated that but it's something he's happy to get if he's in the same area as Moss. Unfortunately, his plans are interrupted when he's taken by his old bosses who can't kill him but are not happy with his desertion.

This book does a lot to flesh out the setting and we learn about what happened to Earth, how freeborn humans (those who aren't genetically modified) ended up enslaved by the cyborgs, and what exactly is going on with humanity's future (hint: it's not good). I really enjoyed getting a sense of how this post-apocalypse setting functions. 

I was surprised at how good Noah Chinn was at making his antagonists sympathetic as well. Roy is a character that is utterly scummy, a pirate and slaver, but you understand how his mind works throughout. It's also good to see him operate behind the scenes, slowly turning all of his enemies among the crew of the Silver Legion into friends or at least allies of convenience. He's not quite Tyrion Lannister or Palpatine but certainly has watched them work.

We also get a serious examination of the ethics of brain uploading and how it might screw with someone's sense of identity. We also find out why it isn't more widely practiced despite the fact that most people would be fascinated by the prospect of immortality, even if it was the diet coke of immortality as I describe it in my books. I think it's handled very well and Violet's struggles with being able to be ""backed up"" or ""copied"" even though it's not ""her"" are fascinating.

If I had one complaint about the book, it is a very small one and almost silly to mention. My inner shipper is annoyed that two of the main characters I was hoping for Moss to hook up with end up together instead. I'm still hoping he'll end up with one of them but it came out of nowhere. I strongly recommend this book and hope you will check it and its predecessor out. I definitely will be picking up the third book.",Fantasy
1712594016.0,Review: Fathomfolk – Eliza Chan (Drowned World #1),"[Family Dynamics](https://thereadingstray.com/tag/family-dynamics/) ✓ [Female Main Character](https://thereadingstray.com/tag/female-main-character/) ✓ [Maritim](https://thereadingstray.com/tag/maritim/) ✓ [Non-Human Protagonist](https://thereadingstray.com/tag/non-human-protagonist-2/) ✓ [Unique Setting](https://thereadingstray.com/tag/unique-setting/) ✓ [Unraveling Mysteries](https://thereadingstray.com/tag/unraveling-mysteries/) ***✓***

*“No matter the uniform she wore, the exams she passed, the ideas she brought to the discussion; they would always see her as Fathomfolk first.”*

**What is the Book about?**

In the semi-flooded city, humans are, quite literally, on peering down from skyscrapers and aerial walkways on the fathomfolk — sirens, seawitches, kelpies and kappas—who live in the polluted waters below.  
   
For half-siren Mira, promotion to captain of the border guard means an opportunity to reform. At last, she has the ear of the city council and a chance to lift the repressive laws that restrict fathomfolk at every turn. But if earning the trust and respect of her human colleagues wasn’t hard enough, everything Mira has worked towards is put in jeopardy when a water dragon is exiled to the city.  
   
New arrival Nami is an aristocratic water dragon with an opinion on everything. Frustrated by the lack of progress from Mira’s softly-softly approach in gaining equality, Nami throws her lot in with an anti-human extremist group, leaving Mira to find the headstrong youth before she makes everything worse.  
   
And pulling strings behind everything is Cordelia, a second-generation sea-witch determined to do what she must to survive and see her family flourish, even if it means climbing over the bodies of her competitors. Her political game-playing and underground connections could disrupt everything Nami and Mira are fighting for.  
   
When the extremists sabotage the annual boat race, violence erupts, as does the clampdown on fathomfolk rights. Even Nami realises her new friends are not what they seem. Both she and Mira must decide if the cost of change is worth it, or if Tiankawi should be left to drown.

**My thoughts while reading it**

***Dive into Tiankawi, a modern city half-submerged in water, a city where humans and deep-sea creatures coexist but not in harmony. The deep-sea beings are a mix of marine creatures, from water dragons to kelpies, sirens, kappas, and sea witches. This provides an unusual setting that should lead us into an original underwater world and explore the depths of the world—or does it?***

Particularly, the setting of Fathomfolk makes this book something special and could captivate many readers. We are not often taken into the depths of the sea for a fantasy story, with its wonderful but also somewhat frightening beings. However, here I must disappoint a little; those who expect an epic fantasy like “The Little Mermaid” will be very disappointed, as the entire story unfolds in the upper realms of the sea, among humans. Initially, this was a bit of a blow, as I was looking forward to it, but then the “human” city managed to charm me. Here awaits us a modern city, designed with extraordinary architecture and sometimes feels like a slightly less cyberpunk world. And also, the fact that humans coexist with the sea creatures, who can take on human form, has adorned the city greatly. We have fantastic affluent neighborhoods with great restaurants and delicious food, but also a kind of ghetto where the less affluent inhabitants of the water-dominated city live. And guess who naturally lives in the ghettos…

Yes, this is a political story that effectively highlights the problems of our world and brings them into a setting that doesn’t make the issues of “immigration” and “foreigners” quite as heavy but still allows for some fun with this book. The immigrants here are the sea people, who consist of many subgroups, which alone is an interesting topic to read about, as humans tend to lump them all together, although you can’t compare a siren to a sea witch or an otter. Yet, even though this theme is touched upon here, the conflict revolves more around the “higher” human race against the sea people. As always, humans think they are better and oppress the sea people. Although the humans act quite decent and nice, you quickly realize that something is very wrong here. And that leads us, of course, to an interesting revolution plot. Humans naturally want to suppress them, control what they fear, and even pollute their waters. Yet there are those striving for change. And this part fits perfectly into this setting. Unfortunately, the entire plot was rather flat and never fully developed. So plot reveals are not really reveals since everything is clear from the beginning, and thus, no tension builds up. The whole story is just too simplistic, and after reading several political and revolution stories, this one here is just too shallow. Maybe I would have liked the plot as a younger reader, as it is not too complex. And the writing style didn’t contribute to making it more exciting to read; instead, it’s quite plain, which makes the whole thing seem even flatter. The conflict between humans and deep-sea beings was fascinating to watch, albeit a bit exaggerated in terms of prejudice.

I had mixed feelings about the characters. I really liked Nami, a young, headstrong water dragon—her kindness and her youthful drive to change the world were something I appreciated. Yes, she seems very young, but that’s okay in this book since she’s a young protagonist. Her innocence and naivety fit very well into this story, as she gets to know the human world all by herself, without being influenced by others. However, later on, Nami became constantly easily influenced, too wrapped up in her own emotions to see the bigger picture, which frustrated me. Meanwhile, Mira took a while to grow on me, and her serious demeanor was a good counterpart to Nami. Because Mira is half human and half siren, she has to try even harder to be taken seriously by the other humans. And even though Mira seems superficially like the good cop, you realize over the course of the story that she’s not always so duty-bound. Still, Mira is nice to read about, but not much more than that. And lastly, there’s a water witch. Oh, and I actually love witches so much. But Cordelia seemed too flat to be like Ursula from Ariel.

Overall, “Fathomfolk” by Eliza Chan excels in creating a fascinating, unique world while also reflecting on themes of prejudice, oppression, and political unrest. However, an interesting and still fresh setting cannot define an entire book, which is why the other aspects were rather shallow. Chan’s debut is entertaining and light, making this book suitable for a good read between epic series but not much beyond that.

1712587020.0,Book Review: Rites of Passage by MD Presley,"**TL;DR Review:** An original and fresh entry in the Urban Fantasy genre, with exciting potential to expand into a great big magical world.

# Full Review:

Urban Fantasy is always a fun genre to dive into. It blends magical elements into our real world, and in so doing, gives rise to the question of “How would that world look of magic really did exist?”

In the world depicted in the pages of *Rites of Passage,* the magical community is divided in a truly fascinating way: the big cities (and highways, a neat touch) are run by the Inner Circle, while the smaller towns and rural areas are run by various smaller factions that control their own territory. There is a sort of “accord” between the Inner Circle and smaller factions, but it is fraught, tense, and often hostile.

That is *exactly* the flavor you can expect from this book. Let me explain…

The main character, Corbin, is on the run from the cult where he was born and raised. All his life, he’s had to keep one huge secret: he has the ability to dowse, to magically trace people using items or objects of great emotional value to them. 

While on the run, he is found by the mysterious “Mister”, a high-ranked magician of the Inner Circle, who brings him into a job to find a fellow magician gone missing. 

Mister and his compatriots belong to the Inner Circle, but where they have to search is in the territory of the Spiral Chains, so they have to team up with magicians from the Chains in order to keep the peace. Only there will be no peace. There is constant bickering, double-dealing, and manipulating—often below the surface, but sometimes out in the open.

I loved how this was very reflective of Corbin’s upbringing in the cult. The hard lessons he learned dealing with the cult’s psychopathic leader, Gideon, makes him adept at navigating the whims and wills of powerful men and women. Though he’s brand new to the world of magic and the power struggles between the two factions, he finds his own feet quickly and begins to earn their respect—and a place among them—through his cunning, insight, and magical abilities.

There isn’t a great deal of focus on characters in this story. We don’t get to know too much about anyone beyond Corbin. But it makes for a fast-paced story that is always moving forward and hurtling at what feels like breakneck speed toward the ending.

I was intrigued by the cult element and Corbin’s personality from the beginning, and drawn further in by the development and explanation of the magical world. By the time I got to the end, I was immensely curious to know more—and was glad to hear this is going to be a longer series. ",Fantasy

1712577089.0,Tigana and Jad world (Children of Earth and Sky),"I'm new to Guy Gavril Kay's novels. So far i've read Tigana, now I'm starting Children. 
Are they set in the same world? I've seen that some other Kay's novels are set in the Jaddite world, but no one includes Tigana in them. 
The first chapter mentions 2 moons - white and blue, while people of the Palm also worshipped 2 moons - blue and silver.
Is it just a coincidence, or is there any more proof they are set on the same planet, only somewhere else? Tigana is set on a relatively small pennisula, and mentions other nations rarely. I also know that Tigana mentions a legend set in the world of Gobelin.",Fantasy
1712576224.0,Adult books like Rowan of Rin?,"So as a kid I loved the books Rowan of Rin by Emily Rodda. I really liked how I felt scared and on edge and wanting to find out what happens next. She did so well with the mystery elements of the book. I loved the world building that Emily Rodda did and I don't really know how that translates as an adult. She also made the character Rowan really likeable for me and I was really rooting for him to succeed on his quests. It kind of gave me slight Harry Potter vibes too? I also really enjoyed the structure of the story, how there would be a beginning section that was relevant to the quest he would have to embark on, then he would have to go on the quest to get something and he discovered something about himself/the village he lived in, and he would go back a hero/with character development. I loved seeing him grow more confident as a character when he was so shy and timid to begin with. It made me feel like I could too as a shy child.

If any of you have read Rowan of Rin, could you give me some other Fantasy books that I'd like as an adult? YA suggestions would also be welcome but I'd prefer adult fantasy.",Fantasy

1712569017.0,Seeking recs: adult fantasy that pulls punches like YA,"Historically I've loved intense and morally gray fantasy, but lately my nervous system can't take a lot of intensity or brutality. YA novels tend to limit how bad things can get but I'm sick of reading about teenagers or ""new adults"" in romantasy. I crave books similar to the ones I've always loved, but I can't handle GRRM's nasty surprises or the final book of Fitz & the Fool right now. 

Would love some recs of books with complex, high-stakes plots and well-developed adult characters that aren't too grimdark, don't have sexual violence or torture, generally keep the suffering and violence to manageable levels, and won't break my heart. I love a good romance and found family, and I appreciate strong women and queer characters. 

ETA: I'm hoping to find some books similar to my favorites below that don't get into the depths of gore or suffering, or at least cut away from the worst of it

My all-time favorites are Hobb's Realm of the Elderlings & Flewelling's Tamir Triad and her first 3 Nightrunner books. I've also really enjoyed the Kushiel's series, ASOIAF, JV Jones' books, The Name of the Wind (not so much the 2nd book), and the Coldfire Trilogy. YA & romantasy I've recently enjoyed: all books by Margaret Owen, The Hunger Games, Throne of Glass (vastly more than ACOTAR), Caraval, The Cruel Prince. 

Thanks in advance!! 

Update: 
I'm so grateful to everyone who's chimed in so far!! Some of these were on my radar but most were not. To clarify further, I'm not looking for anything cozy, only to avoid some of the most disturbing or painful stuff that can really catch you off guard in adult fantasy. I'd prefer happy or bittersweet endings over tragic and depressing ones. And I never said I didn't want sex (see Kushiel's, above)! Just trying to avoid rape or worlds in which sexual violence looms as a threat constantly (like Westeros). Thanks again!

1712568318.0,Product of Their Age And Fantasy - What’s Your Thoughts On This ,"Growing up in the 70s and 80s I loved both the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Lovecraft  and H Rider Haggard. The three upon reflection as an adult I realize they were deeply into the idea at the time called “white man’s burden”. Movies and comics based on their books have been very toned down. I read the L Sprague De Camp’s Conan rewrites where racism were eliminated and Savage Sword rewrites of Robert Howard also eliminated the racism. 

I don’t believe ERB nor HRH books themselves were toned down like Howard’s were. It’s 2024 and we know their racial ideas were very racist yet they were also a product of their time. Last I read Haggard was in the 80s. I loved the adventure and secret civilizations with immortal women. I still consider ERB’s Island trilogy as one of my favorite books when young. 

I would like to reread these books yet I  what I didn’t grasp as a preteen and teen I would grasp today. So is sayng to myself “they are products of their time” ok or is that an excuse? Yet these were not ignorant, uneducated men I sometimes wonder if they did in fact know better but stuck with “white man’s burden” theme for sales. 

Note I am not giving Marion Zimmer Bradley the “product of her time” excuse she knew child abuse and sexual child abuse was wrong. ",Fantasy

1712558786.0,My First Steps into Fantasy. I love Brandon Sanderson,"I recently stumbled upon a new world, a world of Fantasy fiction. As if I had discovered a hidden door in my wardrobe leading to an alternate universe. With an abundance of free time and getting bored with my usual activities, a sudden random thought popped into my head: ""What if I try reading some book?"". The long forgotten ancient craft -- reading.

Craving some fantasy, I began researching and, long story short, I picked up Mistborn. I'm currently on Book 3, and oh my goodness gracious, I love this series so much! I'm getting incredibly excited to start the Stormlight Archive after finishing Mistborn.

After extensive research, I've compiled a list of more than 10 series I'm certainly I'm going to read this year (and a bunch more I'm interested in). It may sound weird, but I feel so torn right now. There are so many books I'm deeply excited about. I want to start reading everything right now, all at once. It paralyses me so bad.

* Not only I still have to finish Mistborn Book 3
* But I got distracted and I'm 200 pages into Robin Hobb's Assassin's Apprentice (god, I'm loving it!)
* At this very moment, I'm itching to start Discworld The Watch subseries.
* I'm intrigued by Malazan Book of The Fallen (although I'm planning it after Stormlight Archive)
* I'm thrilled about the Kingkiller Chronicle
* I've read many positive things about Earthsea cycle
* I'll eventually get to ""The First Law""
* Unfortunately, Tolkien and GRR Martin don't have me as intrigued since I mostly know the plot of their books from TV adaptations
* I'm considering some standalones like Piranesi, Howl's Moving Castle
* Just reading a few quotes from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" sold it to me completely.
* My friend wants me to read ""Book of the New Sun"".

I'm feeling so eager to read everything right now that I feel lost. I'm so desperate that I'll probably have to read 3 books simultaneously in different categories, something like this:

1. Finishing Mistborn -> Stormlight Archive -> Malazan
2. Realm of The Elderling -> Kingkiller Chronicle -> The First Law
3. Discworld The Watch -> Earthsea -> Piranesi

You know, I might be a bit weird, not sure what else to say. Anyway, I want to share why I'm head over heels for Brandon Sanderson's work. It goes without saying that his stories are captivating, his characters are great, and don't even get me started on his mind-blowing magic systems! There is so much great to be said about Brandon, however one thing that is not talked about a lot:

Most fiction is set in worlds reminiscent of medieval Earth (which isn't a bad thing; I'm totally fine with it). However, what I really appreciate about Brandon Sanderson is how distinct and rich his worlds are, filled with inventive elements.

The way environmental factors drastically shape societies and deeply influence daily life, even down to what people wear, such as the ash falls and night mists in Mistborn, creates the feeling of a truly alternate universe. This enriches the immersion so much.

Even reading about the ash falling and curling from the sky in Mistborn is such a pleasure. I love this sense of exploring how things work and function in these worlds and how they affect everything, how wildly different they are from our own world, and it's funny how characters from his books find the normal aspects of our world to be wild.

It's honestly such a breath of fresh air. For this reason, I'm incredibly excited to start the Stormlight Archive, and I expect to see this phenomenon even more in this series, with things like the constant storms affecting the planet. I'm already imagining reading about the details, like how characters have to hide from the storms, unique creatures and such.

I'm thrilled to hear your thoughts on any of the series I've mentioned! And if you think that I'm missing something great, please share it and tell me about it

****Spoilers below****

I absolutely loved these first two books of this series. From the first book Kings of the Wyld with Saga getting back together and battling to save Rose was something out of a Conan tale. Just the banter between the band mates and everything is perfect. Loved it. 

Then you have the second book with Bloody Rose and her band Fable. Loved the characters and development for each. Yes, you kind of knew where this was going but I still loved every page of it. Loved Bloody Rose as a character and her interactions with her band. Yes, every band member had a character to play but I simply love every one of them. And that ending got to me too on an emotional level too. Man, what a ride these first two books in this series is. I’m reading a third book in the series ,Outlaw Empire, is coming this year too? Also, I’ll take any recommendations of books like these two with the combination of characters, action, some love/romance. ",Fantasy
1712545739.0,Wounded Kingdom Series Praise,"I started the first book age of assassins by Rj Barker as a stop gap book to take a break while I'm in between Sci fi series I'm currently reading. Little did I know I'd spend the next 6 days doing nothing but eating/reading until I finished the whole trilogy. 

This is a great series and if you're in the market for a story that follows the life of a protagonist then this is a great nomination. The series follows Girton Club Foot a crippled assassin who lives a **hard** life. The 3 books generally revolve around Girton trying to uncover a sinister plot working in the background that could threaten the kingdom as we know it (I don't want to give away to much but they do generally have a common theme). 

I definitely had my reservations about the series halfway through the second book. I was very frustrated with the characters and the decisions they were making, but I continued to read hoping that it would all be worth it in the end, and boy am I happy I did. The final act in the 2nd book had some great twists and turns, and after finishing the third book I was able to realize how well thought out this series was as a whole as well as better understand the decisions RJ made with the first two books. 

I saw the good reads numbers and I don't think it's as popular as it should be. If you're in the market for a (relatively normal scale) fantasy story that follows a bad ass character throughout their life than look no further. If you liked Pariah or Assassin's apprentice then I think you'll also enjoy this series. ",Fantasy

Off the top of my head, I can't really think of any examples - I think the article mentioned Harry Potter, which doesn't count because his DADA teachers aren't mentors! They're mostly incompetent! I'm not looking for examples where the mentor figure is more or less obviously evil at the beginning. It needs to be a plot twist. 

I think there's even a cliche - might be a superhero movie, maybe? - where the mentor fakes his death and turns out to be a villain, although I don't remember which movie. That's a little bit more specific, but if there are examples of that, too, that would be great.

1712535140.0,Book Review - Beers and Beards: An Adventure Brewing by JollyJupiter ,"**Beers and Beards: An Adventure Brewing by JollyJupiter**

Craft beer brewer Peter Phillips dies and is reincarnated on a fantasy world as a dwarven indentured servant in a penal mine.  Using the knowledge of chemistry and beer brewing, Pete earns his freedom and makes several friends along the way.  Outside of prison, this group of friends band together to save a failing tavern while simultaneously challenging the monolithic Sacred Brew dwarven society rests upon.  The book is half a treatise on brewing beer and the other half a cozy progression fantasy, while simultaneously asking questions about tradition vs. innovation and nature vs. nurture. 

I enjoyed seeing a character in a progression fantasy use knowledge that he brought from Earth to affect change.  While Pete is literally a Chosen One, Pete isn't *randomly* chosen.  He was chosen because of his expertise in brewing and chemistry as well as his dedication to the enjoyment of alcohol. The author makes a very compelling case for why Pete was brought to this world after his death by repeatedly having Pete use his knowledge to solve problems, both personal and social.

It's a very cozy fantasy.  As is indicative of the genre, the focus is on character development.  Pete is a well-developed character who actually undergoes significant change throughout the book.  The surrounding characters are reasonably developed for a self-published fantasy, which is to say that they exist solely to support the main character.  This is slightly problematic because some of the secondary characters are also supposed to be Chosen Ones.  I've seen worse secondary characters in self-published works, though. 

Most conflicts are resolved very quickly and without argument, in keeping with the Cozy genre.  It's refreshing to see adults reasonably work together to solve their disagreements.  There is very little dramatic tension, which is one of the main draws of the Cozy genre.  But just because it's cozy and non-dramatic doesn't mean it's simple.  Pete grapples with questions of what it means to be a dwarf and the questions of innovation verses social acceptance.  It's a very well thought out book.

I would recommend this book to adult non-readers who are interested in STEM as a gateway to get them interested in reading or progression fantasy.

I dislike star ratings because I find them too divisive.  On a scale of ""I don't know why I read this and I want my life back,"" to ""Cornerstone and defining work of the genre,"" I'd put this somewhere around ""Yeah, I'd totally read the sequels and actually like the book.""

1712529726.0,The Pendragon Cycle TV series is coming soon...,"...and I was surprised to find out the production company is The Daily Wire, who are more known for political-conservative podcasts (Ben Shapiro etc).

Lawhead's epic series is probably my favourite fantasy book series of all time, beating The Dark Tower & Lord of the Rings.  It's incredibly vivid!  Ripe for a big-budget Game of Thrones style-treatment.

Yet I assume the budget here will be quite meagre, and I'm hoping that the TV series won't be propagandised to mirror the political-messaging of their podcasts ( I'm often politically-neutral myself, so have no real opinion on The Daily Wire's content...just not inclined to see it on a Pendragon Cycle adaptation).  

Chiefly, I'm wondering if there is enough budget and expertise to really make this series work.  It looks like they're employing podcasters as actors, and management as showrunners/directors...the rest of the cast are glossy-looking young unknowns, none of them having even a Wikipedia entry to their name.

>!Take the shardblades in Stormlight. A magic sword that can cut through anything isn't exactly a revolutionary idea, but the way they are tightly woven into the world makes them much more compelling. Specifically the fact that they're dead spren. This ends up having ramifications for the plot, the history of the world, and the characters. Likewise with other elements of the magic system. They're all tied somehow to the plot and worldbuilding. I also like how the details of how all these elements are related are gradually revealed. We learn about how it all fits together as the characters do.
Wheel of Time does is similar with how saidin and saidar are integrated with the world, its history, the plot, and the characters. It's not just people who can do magic.

Malazan and, to a lesser extent, Dresden do this well too.

The series hadn't sounded like it would be my jam, and what little I had heard sounded a little too modern meta for my tastes. But somehow Muir makes it all work, switching deftly between modern vernacular, memes and comedy to high drama, action, and gothic horror. 

*Gideon* has such a strong narrator voice, carrying you along for the ride, although *Harrow* was my pick of the series so far. *Nona* was a bit too much wheelspinning (imo) and I felt I didn't get anything that couldn't have been compressed into a chapter or two into the eventual *Alecto*.

Judge a book by its cover

*The Storm Beneath The World* is the first book in the grimdark duology Children of Corruption, written by Michael R. Fletcher. A really unique novel, which shines in many aspects, the kind of deranged madness that only Fletcher's mind can produce, wildly imaginative, and with an incredibly engaging plot, dark but also powerful.

The ashkaro, insectile creatures, live in flying islands travelling the River of Days; divided in queendoms, following a caste system that is based on the colours of the carapace, equaling the more colourful to the highest caste (which is reflected by your number of names), in a matriarchal immobile system, swapping the classic gender roles. In this context, war is inevitable between Nysh's queendom, which embraces until certain point the ideas of independence from the swarm, and Yil's, servants of the Old Goddess, which is expanding by conquest.   
To prepare for the imminent war, young ashkaro that manifest dangerous Talents, who would be ostracised in other circumstances, are sent to secret schools to be trained as assassins as spy, separated by castes.

Our story follows several of those young ashkaro, from a wide range of castes; all of them manifests Talents, a really original magic system, which also includes an interesting way of balancing the power, with the user slowly walking towards its own madness by addiction to use it. With a short space of the novel, we are totally invested in said characters, sharing their struggles and their own set of problems (and let me tell you, Joh's point of view is simply a marvel, snarky, full of humour, but also presenting the problems of coming from the lowest class of ashkaro's society).  
With the advancing of the plot, our characters continue growing in their own ways, not always in totally positive ways, creating a captivating but also horrifying experience, as they slowly reveal their secrets and get lured into using more of their powers; all until Queen Yil moves her pieces and attacks the schools, a situation that will allow our lower-class characters to shine, fighting back against.

Excellently paced, I devoured this novel; there's not a single dull moment, keeping you hooked and making you jump in the chair at many points, with many impactful scenes. As said, you can guess through Fletcher's worldbuilding a layer of social commentary, swapping the roles at many points in clever ways; and it is also worth to mention the details lifted from our own world's insects and invertebrate.

*The Storm Beneath the World* is simply a superb Grimdark novel, breaking and imaginative; you will absolutely love it if the genre is your thing. And with that ending, I can't wait until we have the second book in the *Children of Corruption* series.",Fantasy
1712502092.0,Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter - Is it worth it ?,"Hello everyone ! 

I've been meaning to read Rage of Dragons, from Evan Winter, until I started to dig a little into this series. I realised that it's one of series that might never get a conclusion. Do you have any information ? Is it because the author only writes slowly because he has a day job or something like that ? Is it likely we'll get an ending to the series ? Do you know where I could learn more about all of this ?

I want to say thanks to everyone for responding and all these great recommendations! Almost all of these are going into my list to get around to, but three series in particular I'm immediately going to spend credits on for the first installments and put into rotation are


-The Wandering Inn. Honestly the premise on this one is too interesting for me to pass up, someone described it as a mix of slice of life and epic fantasy, which are my two favorite genres, so I'm all in!



-Malazan.  This is one that's been recommended to me before and the passion of the fan base is pretty enticing I have to admit. So congrats, you've sold me!



-The First Law.  The comparisons I've seen to other stories and just the sheer number of people recommending this one have convinced me that there must be something here worth digging into.

1712495342.0,Books with deep emotion that won't make me hate the author for torturing me,"I'm looking for books that evoke deep and/or complex emotion. Dark, sad, and traumatizing moments or arcs are perfectly acceptable, but I don't want to just watch my favorite characters endlessly suffer for the entire series. I just don't have it in me.

I've checked out a ton of threads looking for highly emotional books, and I'm having trouble filtering out the type I mentioned.

Some guidelines for clarity:

* Any flavor of fantasy or science fiction
* Fewer POVs

* Extremely sad/traumatic moments are fine but should be relatively sparse
* There should be tension breaks where the MCs gets some wins from time to time
* Good emotions are also present occasionally
* If there's a lead couple, they should either end up together or die together (maybe there's some wiggle room here, use your best judgement, but mention exceptions in your comment)
* No constant relationship drama that only serves to provide unyielding tension (there can be some... SOME)

Bad examples:

* Robin Hobbs
* Red Rising

Good examples:

* Codename Alera
* Harry Potter
* Fall of Radiance
* Heartstrikers

Borderline:

* Kingkiller - I love it through book 2, but might change my mind after book 3 if it's super horrible emotionally

In fact kingkiller is a good example to touch on. >!There are plenty of horrible things that happen to Kvothe, and they make me appropriate emotional, but if it ends as horribly as Kvothe says it does to Bast, then I suspect I'll be disappointed in the end.!<",Fantasy

1712472864.0,I just finished ‚ The city of Brass‘ (book 1) and I have questions:,"Hey guys,

I just finished ‚The city of Brass‘ (just the first book so no heavy spoilers for the other books please, some hints directly related to my questions are fine) and I have questions:

1) The biggest one first. The epilogue and the last few chapters strongly suggested that I’m supposed to root for and sympathize with the Daeva. We had like 3-4 chapters on how Gassan was mistreating and killing them and how they were suffering and standing with Nahri in brave defiance. Yet… 
The Daeva are ‚fire supremacists‘ who see humans and Shafit as vermin and the other fullbloods as ‚inferior races‘. They moan about their mistreatment and unfairness in the world the same way former colonizers moan about only being very rich and influential instead of being allowed to enslave nations and be above the law…Frankly speaking I thought all book Darah was a hateful maniac! Am I really supposed to root for these people?

Honestly I think it’s an awesome world but there isn’t a single character or faction I feel are in the right or I should root for 😅

2) The stories mention 5 (I think) Dschjin tribes. Yet all of the book basically only revolves around the Gazani and the Daeva! Do the other tribes not live in Daevabad and have a voice in politics or what am I overlooking? Frankly I don’t even have an idea what the other tribes look or act like or believe. Did I miss it?

3) Darah suddenly towards the end of the story basically turned into Dschjin Superman who could do anything defying all rules we learned about this world to the extend that all but those carrying Sulimans seal were essentially helpless against him. I’m a bit confused… if Afshin had/have such power and if people with that kind of power exist… how were there wars and armies not just the godlike being duking it out and everybody else watching? I always struggle to square Superman type figures that are unkillable (as we hear in the epilogue apparently not even turning to dust can harm Darah which is done DBZ level ‚no stakes‘ stuff), invincible and break every rule we established with a coherent world… 🤔

Thnx in advance for those who remember and engage 🤗",Fantasy

The main difficulty was not finding books, but that I really underestimated the mental whiplash from so many different world views. I needed breaks between books more often. I finished my last book on the afternoon of March 31st, the druid book by a South African author.

My rule was the author had to have grown up in the country to count, actual pernickety rules in post 1.


18 Elemental Magic **The Library of the Dead** 2021 by T.L. Huchu *Zimbabwe*. Set in Scotland, with magic, after some disaster which we don't know much about because the MC  was too young to remember the world before and is uninterested in anything but providing for herself and her family. Read this a year ago and I still feel I know Ropa, the main character. Bingo 2024 First in a series, Author of Color HM, Survival.

19 Myths & Retellings. **The Whispering Muse** 2005 by Sjon *Iceland*. Well this was amazing. I kept wondering until near the end if the narrator was an evil person, repentant evil or just a jerkish monomaniacal bore. He is on a ship with a storyteller who is an immortal person from a Greek myth, who retells some of the Jason and the Argonauts story. Excellent change in voice between the narrator and the storyteller.  Don't look up the original Greek myths if you need trigger warnings, because they need all of them. The book not so much. I'll be reading more by this author.  Bingo 2024 I Think the MC counts as a Criminal, he would disagree.

20 Queernorm Setting **Counterweight** 2021 by Djuna *South Korea*. Science fiction, I enjoyed this, the plot was pretty straightforward though the setting wasn't. Bingo 2024 Author of Color

21 Island or Coastal Setting **Owlish** 2020 by Dorothy Tse *Hong Kong*. Most unusual book I read all year, very memorable, several reviews said it was difficult but if you've read Orwell's 1984 you'll be fine, though possibly still horrified. Bingo 2024 Author of Color, possibly Dark Academia hard mode? not sure

23 Druids **Bones and Runes** 2021 by Stephen Embleton *South Africa*. Lots of Zulu mythos and language here, and the two male protagonists took a while to stop being irritating, hey if a few supernatural entities tell you to show respect maybe you should? Better once the woman showed up, and I thought the ending was handled well. Bingo 2024 Multi POV, Disability (depression) HM, Survival HM, References HM.

24 Robots **Red Dust**2004 by Yoss *Cuba*. This was fun, the MC is a positronic robot on an alien space station with some space travel. Predates Murderbot, positronic robots do not suffer from existential angst though they do love films and novels. It was like reading Asimov with a most of the problematic bits removed, though still not enough women. Bingo 2024 Space Opera

25 Sequel **Resonance Surge** 2023 by Nalini Singh *New Zealand*. I really like the Psy Changeling series, and this was a another good entry. I think you can read most of them without prior knowledge. Bingo 2024 Dreams, Author of Colour,  Romantasy maybe, there are shapechangers and psionic powers but really it reads more science fiction than fantasy.

1712434293.0,Book Recommendations: Protagonist vs. Time Travelers or Time Reversal Characters?," I have always wanted to read something similar to the story of Dusttale. Dusttale is a fan-made alternative timeline of the game Undertale. Saving and reloading the game is crucial to the story. Characters experience déjà vu after reloading, and some are aware that the player can reload. In Dusttale, the player only follows the No Mercy Route, where all the characters are killed. After the player repeats the No Mercy Route 327 times, a character suddenly becomes aware of all the player's playthroughs through a glitch in the game. This character is Sans the Skeleton, who starts killing everyone he comes across, regardless of whether they are friends or family, to level up faster than the player. He does this so he can finally stop the player. Although he reaches a higher level, he is still beaten by the player.

So Hoa and Steel/the gray stone eater are enemies, right? Steel supported the people attacking Castrima-under in book 2 and messed up Hoa really badly etc., and I think Hoa explained at some point that they are opposed to each other because they want to use the Obelisk Gate for different purposes, right?

Steel has teamed up with Nassun (or at least, at the point I'm at, he protected her by killing Nida or whatever one of the Evil Earth infected guardians was called). Nassun wants to use the Obelisk Gate to get the moon back, at least that's what she says. I'm not sure whether she wants to do that just to appease Evil Earth or to prevent the Season to last for ages or both, but so far, so good.

Hoa has teamed up with Essun ages ago. But isn't their goal just the same? Use the Obelisk Gate to get the moon back to prevent the Season from lasting for ages/to stop seasons from happening altogether?

My question is: did I get that right so far (which means thst basically, Nassun + Steel and Essun + Hoa are basically, unbeknownst to each other, kind of on the same quest - and I assume that Steel has ulterior motives and wants Nassun to do something else with the Obelisk Gate, but it isn't revealed yet what) or did I get it wrong and we either already know what Steel wants by this point (if yes, I missed it) or Nassun and Essun have different goals with the Obelisk Gate (if yes, I missed that)?

# Q&A

**Thank you for agreeing to this Q&A. Before we start, tell us about yourself.**

I’m so deeply honoured to be able to do this!

I’m the award-winning author (and narrator) of the imPerfect Cathar series. Originally from Leicester, England, I obviously did something right in a past life - unlike my protagonists - because I’ve ended up living in the south of France with my wife and two kids. I’ve lived nearly as many lives as Paul Bonhomme though - I’ve done all sorts of odd things, from running a hiphop record label (including featuring myself as a rapper) to hustling disability living aids on the mean streets of Syston. I’m particularly proud of the work I’ve done managing and recording several French hiphop acts, and I’m still currently awaiting confirmation of wild rumours I might get a Gold Disc for a song I recorded and mixed.

**What brought you to** r/fantasy\*\*? What do you appreciate about it?\*\*

I love the sense of community around the same loves that I carry in my heart. Whenever someone throws out a request for anything - regardless of how apparently niche or obscure - you know everyone’s going to pull out these incredible recommendations, like rabbits from an old top hat. On top of that, the support for all the indie community projects, like the Fantasy Megasale, the SPFBO & the Indie Ink Awards is just phenomenal.

**Who are your favorite current writers and who are your greatest influencers?**

For current writers, I think Seanan McGuire takes some beating. There’s just something about how she welds the dark to the delightful which is always such a revelation. I absolutely love Craig Schaefer as well. Anything Neil Gaiman touches, which is more screen based at the moment but doesn’t detract from the value. On the indie scene Bob McGough is a major talent too. Krista Walsh is fantastic, Heather G Harris as well, there’s so many unbelievably skilled writers out there!

In terms of my greatest influences, there’s all the classics - Terry Pratchett, Gaiman again. Alan Moore. The Earthsea Trilogy by Ursula K. Le Guin changed my life, as did LOTR. The Borribles by Michael De Larrabeiti was the first book that made me cry as a child and probably launched my lifelong love affair with Urban Fantasy. Iain M. Banks’s Culture series showed me how to craft a believable reality and tell tales about our own with it as much as Discworld did.

**Can you lead us through your creative process? What works and doesn’t work for you? How long do you need to finish a book?**

I find that sitting down every day and writing really works for me. That probably sounds really boring or a cop out but it’s the truth. When life or other creative demands - the audiobooks, or the business side of publishing - stop me writing every day, I can feel how comparatively rusty I am when I start again. I stay focused on one project from start to finish - although with the new co-writing projects I’m starting I’m going to attempt to get two or three projects going at the same time, and see how that works for me - and just try and put as much time in front of the keyboard as life will allow me. I’m a really fast writer - I can easily write 1500-2000 words per hour - so there are days when I can manage to write 10,000 words. It’s like I just hack into my own hindbrain and it pours out. I think years of freestyling - proper improvised rapping - helped with that. But most days I manage 3-5000 words. So I can write a first draft in a month, although often life has other things to say about it, so it tends to be more like two months to get it written.

**How would you describe the plot of** ***imPerfect Magic*** **if you had to do so in just one or two sentences?**

Three immortal heretics in the south of France discover impossible angel-made runes which draw them into a dark, twisting mystery, posing the question - if you can’t die, what will you sacrifice to save the world?

**What subgenres does it fit?**

Urban fantasy, low fantasy, contemporary fantasy, whatever you want to call it but with a historical fantasy element due to flashbacks throughout the book and a strong literary bent to the writing, despite all the swearing and dad jokes.

**How did you come up with the title** ***and how does it tie in with the plot of the book?***

The main character, Paul Bonhomme, was a Cathar Perfect, or priest, in his first life. This real-life group of heretical Christians were exterminated in the only Crusade ever perpetrated against other Christians, the Albigensian Crusade, which also led to the creation of the Inquisition, back in the 13th Century. Their crime? Believing in equality of the sexes, duality, vegetarianism, and that priests were servants of the people rather than the other way around. The latter was the one which really upset the church. Due to… *things*… which happened, that we find out about during the book, Paul doesn’t stay dead, but comes back to life in the nearest dead body after he’s killed. Fast forward eight hundred years, and he’s now a Talented - or magic user - in modern day Toulouse, but he’s no longer a holy man. Indeed his flaws are what keep him tied to life, which keep him coming back again and again. So now he’s imPerfect. Thus the title of the series - The imPerfect Cathar - and as the first book deals with his origin story along with the first modern day mystery, including how he got his powers, imPerfect Magic was the perfect title for it!

**What inspired you to write this story? Was there one “lightbulb moment” when the concept for this book popped into your head or did it develop over time?**

I’m lucky enough to live in the south of France now. The Cathar history is very prominent down here, and my brother bought me a great book when I moved here called ‘A Perfect Heresy’ by Stephen O’Shea, about the history of the crusades. When I read about their beliefs, the idea of them believing in reincarnation kept tickling away at the back of my brain. What if it was true? What if one of them kept reincarnating each time they died, remembered their past lives? What if they had magic? And what if they were alive now, in modern Toulouse? That was the kickoff for me in the story idea starting to come to fruition.

**If you had to describe** ***the story*** **in 3 adjectives, which would you choose?**

Twisting, dark and hopeful.

**Would you say that** ***imPerfect Magic*** **follows tropes or kicks them?**

Hmm, that’s tricky. I’d say as a rule kicks them. It’s definitely not following the standard UF tropes. The only one you might say it follows is found family, which is such a strong component of the setup.

**Who are the key players in this story? Could you introduce us to** ***imPerfect Magic*** **protagonists/antagonists?**

I’ve already spoken about Paul Bonhomme, the main character whose viewpoint we read from. There are two other members of Team Bonhomme. First is Isaac, known in history as Isaac the Blind, though not for any problems with his eyesight. The real-life founder of Kabbalah - which genuinely was invented - or at least formalised - at the same time as the Albigensian Crusades in the south of France, just down the road in Montpellier - he’s a mentor-slash-father figure to Paul. He also shares his soul with Nithael, one of the Bene Elohim angels, a being from the higher dimensions. The other member is Aicha Kandicha, the Druze Queen. Indestructible - she reforms as soon as she’s injured - Paul rescued her from Nazi captivity when storming a lab in La Rochelle in 1945. She’s the fan favourite character, an absolute destructive force of nature who covers up her trauma with pop culture references. She’s also based on a real character. Aicha Kandicha is the bogeywoman of Morocco, seen as an evil djinn and it’s considered a portent of doom to see her. However, when I researched her I found out she was a real person. A duchess from Al-Jadida (just south of Casablanca) in the ninth century, she used her feminine wiles to lead Portuguese raiders into a trap, saving her people, but being demonised in history for it. I loved the idea of reclaiming her as a positive force, so in my world she headed east after her people turned their back on her. Encountering the Druze in modern day Lebanon (a heretical offspring of Islam which still has about a million practicants today and has beliefs very similar to the Cathars in many ways) she becomes the guardian of the aab-al-Hayaat; the Waters of Life. Also she’s ace-aro so the friendship between her and Paul is exactly that - a real, deep, genuine friendship which will never become romantic.

The other character who shows up a lot in imPerfect Magic is Franc. He’s a slimy water monster who shares Toulouse with Paul, acting as an informant for him through the homeless population, who he controls in exchange for keeping them alive. Think of a cross between a Shakesperean Fagin and a psychic Smeagol and you won’t be far off.

The antagonist we know little of. Only that he has control of an Elohimc - which should be impossible - and that Paul christens him Phone Dick, as he only talks to them through the telephone they find at the site of the angelic runes.

**Have you written imPerfect Magic with a particular audience in mind?**

It’s definitely for a more adult audience. Very strong language and quite gory/dark. For those who wanted some bite to their story without all the romance, and something deeper than a lot of the (often fantastic) popcorn literature that populates the genre.

**Alright, we need the details on the cover. Who's the artist/designer, and can you give us a little insight into the process for coming up with it?**

Absolutely. The cover designer is Nick Jones. We’ve been friends for decades, and he did the design for my last album cover. So when I wrote the book, I decided I wanted to ask him to do the covers. We studied the market together, and he read the book, then came up with the cover design based on what he’d read.

**What was your proofreading/editing process?**

The first book went through about seven drafts before it was ready for an editor. I was lucky enough to get some amazing advice after reading early drafts from both Claire North/Kate Griffin and Heather G Harris. Additionally my beta readers Becky Puff and Becca Wood both read it at least once - I think Becca (who is my critique partner and who I’ll be co-writing another book with soon) read it about three times in total!

Once it went through my editor Miranda Grant, I ended up re-writing about a third of it entirely - including all the parts set in the past - and then she proofread it.

Now, with the books, I write a first and second draft. Then it goes to the betas, then to my editor. Then I make the corrections, and send it for proofreading. Recording my own audiobooks always then traps another load of errors which I correct, then it goes to my ARC team who always pick up a few more!

**What are you most excited for readers to discover in this book?**

The world itself. I think the way I’ve woven together French history and mythology into a modern setting is something quite unique, and that the world becomes one of the voiciest characters. Which, considering how vocal the whole cast are, tells you something!

**Can you, please, offer us a taste of your book, via one completely out-of-context sentence?**

Sure.

>‘You don’t save people cos they’re good. That’ll only ever lead to disappointment.’ She looks up at me sharply, that intense burning gaze fixing on me. ‘Save people because you’re good. Even if you’re a twat too.’

I hope the language is okay for Reddit! Feel free to bleep it out if not. Thank you so much for this fantastic opportunity, I really appreciate it.

1712418803.0,Review for 'Penric and Desdemona: Demon Daughter' by Lois McMaster Bujold,"[Demon Daughter Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205048105-demon-daughter?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=bFYC3GrqZp&rank=4)

This is book 12 in the Penric and Desdemona series by Lois McMaster Bujold. I'm a fan of this series, needless to say based upon the fact that I'm reading book 12 in this series.

This Penric book is very character focused, on many layers. When Penric becomes the caretaker of a six-year-old girl, Penric and Desdemona are drawn into conflict. The girl is in possession of a young elemental, and as a six-year-old, she's too young for the responsibility that entails. Penric wants to exorcise the elemental from the girl, but Desdemona wants to not exorcise the elemental because the elemental is the demon-equivalent of a baby.

At the same time, Penric's wife Nikys is recovering from a miscarriage. She happily adds the 6-year-old to their family, as something of a replacement. Pen and Niky already have a son and daughter, so the whole family gets involved in making the new child fit in. This could have come across as tasteless, but I feel like Bujold handled this well.

I really enjoyed this book, the sense of tension between Pen and Desdemona felt palpable. This book had something most Bujold books lack: interpersonal conflict between the protagonists for justified reasons. Desdemona, being a demon, sees the innocence in the baby elemental, wants to protect the baby demon. Penric, being a human, wants to protect the young girl. Their desires are in conflict. This was GREAT reading. Bujold doesn't often write scenarios where two heroes are forced to have mutually exclusive goals. Most authors don't write scenarios like this. That is good writing.

If I were to critique the direction this series is going, it feels repetitive. I'm fine with low stakes books, but many of the books in this series feel low-tension. A lot of this series pulls it's punches. This is a 12-book long series where all the books strike the same soft tone. I often complain about series where the author use the 'end of the world as we know it' stakes with every book, perennially upping the stakes with every volume. This series is the reverse. The Pen & Des series is so committed to being low stakes that I'm getting a bit bored.",Fantasy

#Blurb

*Multiverse travel is finally possible, but there’s just one catch: No one can visit a world where their counterpart is still alive. Enter Cara, whose parallel selves happen to be exceptionally good at dying—from disease, turf wars, or vendettas they couldn’t outrun. Cara’s life has been cut short on 372 worlds in total.*

*On this Earth, however, Cara has survived. Identified as an outlier and therefore a perfect candidate for multiverse travel, Cara is plucked from the dirt of the wastelands. Now she has a nice apartment on the lower levels of the wealthy and walled-off Wiley City. She works—and shamelessly flirts—with her enticing yet aloof handler, Dell, as the two women collect off-world data for the Eldridge Institute. She even occasionally leaves the city to visit her family in the wastes, though she struggles to feel at home in either place. So long as she can keep her head down and avoid trouble, Cara is on a sure path to citizenship and security.*

*But trouble finds Cara when one of her eight remaining doppelgängers dies under mysterious circumstances, plunging her into a new world with an old secret. What she discovers will connect her past and her future in ways she could have never imagined—and reveal her own role in a plot that endangers not just her world, but the entire multiverse.*

#Review

*  I read this quite blindly due to a friend's recommendation and enjoyed it more than I expected. The concept itself - Cara being such a valuable world-traveller due to how unlikely it is for her to survive to adulthood - is a great selling point by itself, but the book doesn't only deliver on the execution of that concept, but also captured me quite well with regards to Cara's complicated relationship to her abusive ex lover Nic as well as to her coworker Dell. 
* I listened to the audiobook narrated by Nicole Lewis and found it a very good rendition, I can recommend the format. If I misspell things, this is why.    
* Cara comes from a poor background and has gone through numerous traumatic events from a young age - it's what makes her suited for her job. I liked that her trauma obviously informed her character and choices and felt weighty and real, but that the book never lingers on it to the point of feeling edgy.   
* The story has a certain beautiful, visceral feel to it. All in all I wouldn't exactly call it *literary*, but... I'm not sure how to describe it, it's just really well crafted imo. 
* The main thing that this book does really well imo is exploring how different people's lives turn out based on a few key choices or events, and I really liked how it explored those    
* The worldbuilding (on Earth 0) is kind of basic, you have the rich, clean, safe, modern Wiley City and the dangerous, poor, polluted Ashtown, with little mention of any territory outside of the two territories. Ashtown being ruled by a violent Emperor gives it a more post-apocalyptic fantasy feel, while Wiley feels like a different world entirely. It's basic, but imo it worked perfectly fine for the story.  
* Honestly there's not *that* much I even want to talk about in the spoiler-free section because there's so many neat little twists and reveals that shape the story as it progresses. I really just thought this book did that all really well. 



---

#Discussion

* There's a handful of minor twists and revelations that I found well constructed and that were (for me) just foreshadowed enough that I guessed some of them but didn't find them too obvious. For example, that >!the main Cara is not actually from Earth 0 originally!<, or that the reason Dell >!is so cold with her is due to her kissing Caramenta right after meeting her and getting shot down hard!<. It's not super duper special but it just worked well and was satisfying to read imo.  
* I loved the complicated feelings this book gave me about Nic: Obviously, >!the Nic from Caralee's past is horrible with few redeeming qualities, but then we see an Earth 175 Nic who's turned out so completely different that they end up as something like friends.!< That in turn then made me find >!Earth 0 Nic somewhat sympathetic, as he and Cara become allies, even though he too takes the first opportunity he has to get violent with her!<. I really liked that these different versions felt plausible, for the most part. 
* That being said, idk if I buy >!Caramenta being such a complete asshole to Dell after living such a sheltered life.!< That could have perhaps used a bit more exploration, idk.   
* I really liked the scene where Cara goes >!to the House after Jeane's death and just cries in Exlee's (idk how to spell it sorry) room. That acknowledgement that she just needs someone to go ""what do you need, child"" and hold her!<  felt very visceral and lovely to me.

**Conclusion** This book was cool and I liked it. No hot takes from me today, so this might not be my most interesting review, but I wanted to write it anyway because I haven't seen many people talk about this book and I'm looking forward to hearing other people's opinion on it.

1712383874.0,Review - Dodger by Terry Pratchett,"[https://www.noahchinnbooks.com/2024/04/05/review-dodger-by-terry-pratchett-2/](https://www.noahchinnbooks.com/2024/04/05/review-dodger-by-terry-pratchett-2/)

Dodger is one of Terry Pratchett’s (rare) Non-Discworld books, set in early Victorian London.  It comes across something as a lighthearted Dickensian novel, which is rather appropriate since Charles Dickens is a rather prominent figure in the book. In fact, the book revolves around historical figures, both factual and fictional, from the time period.

The story revolves around Dodger, a young ‘tosher’ (one that searches for loot in the antiquated Roman sewers of London) who comes to the rescue of a woman set upon by two thugs on a dark and stormy night (oh God, did I just say that?)  But rather than some random ‘orribleness (that is not, admittedly, uncommon to these streets of London) it turns out something rather more complicated is involved.  Not that Dodger cares, he just wants to find out who’s at the bottom of it and make them pay.

Since Charles Dickens is involved in this story, you would expect Dodger to be the inspiration for The Artful Dodger, which of course he is – but along the course of the book a number of other “inspirations” pop up which the writer dutifully scribbles down.

There are in a way two stories unfolding here: One is of the growth of Dodger from a talented, well, Dodger, to making something much more of himself – but without losing who he is, either.

The other story is of London.  A London in transition.  This is the time where the Bow Street Runners have just been replaced with Robert Peel’s “Peelers” (later, Bobbies), the first real police force.  The Roman sewers are not long for this world, as the man behind their reconstruction to the most modern in the world (still in use to this day), Joseph Bazalgette, is taking an active interest in them.  Human rights are being fought for by the likes of Henry Mayhew, as well as other reforms in the future as a young Benjamin Disraeli is introduced, and perhaps, most interestingly, Angela Burdett-Coutts, who was the richest woman in the world at the time and who spent most of her time giving it away and trying to make the world a better place.

Dodger comes in and out of these worlds, and they into his, as the story unfolds.  This light story just might get someone who has never read Dickens to give him a try, and for that reason alone I’d have to recommend it.  But it’s also Pratchett at perhaps his best, taking a break from the Disc.",Fantasy

1712379143.0,What is the best horror fantasy books you have read?,I’ve just read Between Two Fires by Christopher Buehlman and discovered that I love the blend of fantasy and horror. I didn’t know this was a thing before this book and was wondering what other amazing books are out there in this genre,Fantasy
1712377970.0,The Killing Moon by NK Jemisin is an incredible novel!,"The book is set in the land of Gujaareh, a fictional city-state very loosely inspired by Ancient Egypt. The magic system is based on dreams, which can be extracted in rituals for healing purposes. This magic can also be used by Gatherers to give people a peaceful death. In Gujaareh, this power must be used to keep peace and balance. But a Gatherer, his apprentice, and a foreign ambassador, begin to suspect that there’s a conspiracy going on behind the scenes that threatens to upset this peace. 

This book is so incredible! My favorite part was the worldbuilding, it was so rich and imaginative. I loved immersing myself in this world. There were so many little details that brought it to life. And i loved the role dreams played in the story- apparently inspired by the work of Freud and Jung. 

The characters were also very well written. I found myself especially invested in Ehiru, as his internal struggles were so fascinating and often gut-wrenching. But even minor characters felt so lively and real! If I could think of an issue with the book, it’s probably that it was slow at some points, mainly towards the middle and near the end. But it picked up at the end and had a great resolution. Also, some of the worldbuilding and magic stuff was hard to keep track of at first. But I figured it out before long. 

I tried to read The Fifth Season a couple years back but I couldn’t get through it as I found it too dense and confusing. But I definitely want to revisit it now. Just as soon as I finish the sequel, The Shadowed Sun, which I have already started. I’m really hoping it will visit some other countries or cultures so it can introduce new worldbuilding concepts!",Fantasy

1712370869.0,A merger of reality and fiction,"I have a running hypothesis that the best fiction works are the ones that make themselves accessible, almost tangible to the reader. They make the reader feel like they themselves are actually a part of the fictional world created by the author. Harry Potter is an obvious example of this. What kid growing up in the early 2000s didn't go to bed every night hoping to see an owl sitting on their window sill, envelope in its bill? Lev Grossman's The Magicians used the same trope; normal people living their normal loves suddenly find themselves studying magic at Brakebills instead of accounting/engineering/<insert mundane field of study> at Generic State University. They granted you, the reader, the ability to really fantasize about escaping boring reality to this fantastical fiction that was just right there, around the corner, so close to real life you can almost taste it. 

White Wolf Publishing made their iconic table top roleplaying game Vampire: The Masquerade using a similar philosophy. Set in The World of Darkness, vampires are real and living among us. The WoD is essentially the same as modern day earth; same countries, same bullshit politics, same economic/social/environmental woes, but bleaker, darker, and the supernatural is real. Not wanting to be on the cover of the New York Times and having a thousand AR15 wielding vampire hunters show up at their doorstep, kindred keep to the shadows and pull the strings of the world. The player character is some average schmuck until *surprise* you're embraced by a vampire, become their childe, and get a crash course in how the WoD *really* works.

These aren't new ways of story telling either. Dracula, being an epistolary novel, tells its tale through a collection of diary entries and letters exchanged between the characters. As such it gives the reader a feel of being an historian sifting through piles of primary source literature rather than an obviously fictional novel. It suggests that this was a real story that really happened, and that's what's scary about it. Lovecraft's Call of Chthulu is sort of pseudo-epistolary in that it follows a character through the process of unpacking and reading through his recently deceased uncle's journals and picking up where he left off in trying to unravel the mysteries of the cult of Chthulu. Through the course of it, the book makes it clear that simply knowing about the existence of Chthulu and the cult is dangerous. Once known, that knowledge is a curse because you are now a target for the cult. The reader, by reading the book and knowing what they now know, has cursed themselves. 

All this is a very wordy way of requesting recommendations for other books that do the same; books that make the reader feel like part of the story and/or like this strange fiction maybe actually isn't fiction after all. Thanks in advance. (:

For reference these are some of the audiobooks I've listened to:

The Dresden Files, really love these, I like Masters narration, the world building and are some the few books that have made me laugh out loud.

Some Horus Heresy books, the audio effects of war that came from time to time were great and the narrator gave the gravitas to all the characters very well.

1712349600.0,On MCUfication of Stormlight/Cosmere,"Does anyone else feel like Sanderson’s attempts to build a sort of multiverse for his works actually harmed it? It’s subjective but it seems that the more interconnected his works become, the more their quality declines: original worldbuilding and plot development are replaced by endless easter eggs and references. It seriously resembles MCU trajectory over past decade: Cosmere book quality peaked at Oathbringer and started to dramatically decline as they sprawled into some sort of global multiverse narrative. Same can be said for character writing: it’s some sort of self-flanderization, where Kaladin and others start as fairly complex characters and then gradually become cardboard caricatures of themselves, reduced to same rehashed plot points and their token mental illness traits. His dialogue writing has never been strong but initially it was quite decent; now it’s literally MCU-ish endless quipping and attempts at zoomer humor that irreversibly breaks immersion.

1712346986.0,Fantasy Novels Equivalent To Michener’s Style,"In the early 2000s I found James Michener’s novels and loved them. I always thought he was at his best when he took a location like in his books  Chesapeake or The Source and in about 1000+ pages wrote  a fictional story that encompassed hundreds to thousands of years. I would have loved to have seen him apply this to a fantasy world and having it encompass a thousand or so years in one book. 

Yes many fantasy writers write series that encompass thousands of years but I can’t think of one who does it in a stand alone novel. I know Lackey has done this with her Valdemar books but she did it in over 25 books.

The nomination thread can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/s/txNz8Vw59n). 

**Voting**

There are five options to choose from:

[A Study in Drowning by Ava Reid](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75302266) 

**Mental Illness Rep: Effy has PTSD, psychosis, hallucinations, and delusions.**

> Effy Sayre has always believed in fairy tales. Haunted by visions of the Fairy King since childhood, she’s had no choice. Her tattered copy of Angharad—Emrys Myrddin’s epic about a mortal girl who falls in love with the Fairy King, then destroys him—is the only thing keeping her afloat. So when Myrddin’s family announces a contest to redesign the late author’s estate, Effy feels certain it’s her destiny.

> But musty, decrepit Hiraeth Manor is an impossible task, and its residents are far from welcoming. Including Preston Héloury, a stodgy young literature scholar determined to expose Myrddin as a fraud. As the two rivals piece together clues about Myrddin’s legacy, dark forces, both mortal and magical, conspire against them—and the truth may bring them both to ruin.

> Part historical fantasy, part rivals-to-lovers romance, part Gothic mystery, and all haunting, dreamlike atmosphere, Ava Reid's powerful YA debut will lure in readers who loved The Atlas Six, House of Salt and Sorrows, or Girl, Serpent, Thorn.

[Borderline by Mishell Baker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25692886) 

**Mental Illness Rep: Millie has borderline personality disorder.** 

> A year ago, Millie lost her legs and her filmmaking career in a failed suicide attempt. Just when she’s sure the credits have rolled on her life story, she gets a second chance with the Arcadia Project: a secret organization that polices the traffic to and from a parallel reality filled with creatures straight out of myth and fairy tales. 

> For her first assignment, Millie is tasked with tracking down a missing movie star who also happens to be a nobleman of the Seelie Court. To find him, she’ll have to smooth-talk Hollywood power players and uncover the surreal and sometimes terrifying truth behind the glamour of Tinseltown. But stronger forces than just her inner demons are sabotaging her progress, and if she fails to unravel the conspiracy behind the noble’s disappearance, not only will she be out on the streets, but the shattering of a centuries-old peace could spark an all-out war between worlds.

[For a Muse of Fire by Heidi Heilig](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36220335) 

**Mental Illness Rep: Jetta has bipolar disorder.** 

> A young woman with a dangerous power she barely understands. A smuggler with secrets of his own. A country torn between a merciless colonial army, a terrifying tyrant, and a feared rebel leader. The first book in acclaimed author Heidi Heilig’s Shadow Players trilogy blends traditional storytelling with ephemera for a lush, page-turning tale of escape and rebellion. For a Muse of Fire will captivate fans of Sabaa Tahir, Leigh Bardugo, and Renée Ahdieh.

> Jetta’s family is famed as the most talented troupe of shadow players in the land. With Jetta behind the scrim, their puppets seem to move without string or stick—a trade secret, they say. In truth, Jetta can see the souls of the recently departed and bind them to the puppets with her blood. But ever since the colonizing army conquered their country, the old ways are forbidden. Jetta must never show, never tell. Her skill and fame are her family’s way to earn a spot aboard the royal ship to Aquitan, where shadow plays are the latest rage, and where rumor has it the Mad King has a spring that cures his ills. Because seeing spirits is not the only thing that plagues Jetta. But as rebellion seethes and as Jetta meets a young smuggler, she will face truths and decisions that she never imagined—and safety will never seem so far away.

[Fire with Fire by Destiny Soria](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53968522) 

**Mental Illness Rep: Eden has anxiety.** 

> Dani and Eden Rivera were both born to kill dragons, but the sisters couldn’t be more different. For Dani, dragon slaying takes a back seat to normal high school life, while Eden prioritizes training above everything else. Yet they both agree on one thing: it’s kill or be killed where dragons are concerned.

> Until Dani comes face-to-face with one and forges a rare and magical bond with him. As she gets to know Nox, she realizes that everything she thought she knew about dragons is wrong. With Dani lost to the dragons, Eden turns to the mysterious and alluring sorcerers to help save her sister. Now on opposite sides of the conflict, the sisters will do whatever it takes to save the other. But the two are playing with magic that is more dangerous than they know, and there is another, more powerful enemy waiting for them both in the shadows.

[The Light Between Worlds by Laura E. Weymouth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34842042) 

**Mental Illness Rep: PTSD, depression, suicidal ideation, and disordered eating.** 

> Five years ago, Evelyn and Philippa Hapwell cowered from air strikes in a London bomb shelter. But that night took a turn when the sisters were transported to another realm called the Woodlands. In a forest kingdom populated by creatures out of myth and legend, they found temporary refuge.

> When Ev and Phil finally returned to London, nothing had changed at all—nothing, except themselves.

> Now, Evelyn spends her days sneaking into the woods outside her boarding school, wishing for the Woodlands. Overcome with longing, she is desperate to return no matter what it takes.

> Philippa, on the other hand, is determined to find a place in this world. She shields herself behind a flawless exterior and countless friends, and moves to America to escape the memory of what was.

> But when Evelyn goes missing, Philippa must confront the depth of her sister’s despair and the painful truths they’ve been running from. As the weeks unfold, Philippa wonders if Ev truly did find a way home, or if the weight of their worlds pulled her under.

1712334471.0,One Man’s Bingo is Another Man’s Bingo: Books I Read for 2023 Bingo and What Categories YOU can Use Them For in 2024!,"I usually start my Bingo planning sometime in January or February, playing mix and match with the pile of books I’ve already read that year and then figuring out what I’ll need to scramble to finish in time to fill the five or six squares for which I couldn’t find any matches. This post is for everyone who’s better at planning ahead than I.

This was the first year I’ve started writing down thoughts on books I’ve read (thank you to the Bingo Hero Mode button for shaming me each year I did not), and I’m very glad I began. Taking some time to reflect on each book has done a lot to force me to consume media more critically, and I think that I’ve gotten much more out reading this year than I would have if I’d read the same books without reviewing. 

Some disclaimers: the books below are grouped by tier, but not necessarily ordered within each tier. For 2024 categories, I did my best to remember stuff like number of POV characters and whatnot, and looked back when I could to check for the trickier to recall squares: prologues and epilogues, dreams, reference materials, etc. Despite my best efforts I’ve certainly failed to list all the potential categories for every book, and likely listed a few that don’t belong, so buyer beware.

I don’t believe I read anything at all for 2023 that could count for Orcs, Trolls, and Goblins, Published in 2024, or Dark Academia. For Judge a Book by its Cover, I really like the covers for Untethered Sky, The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi, Chain Gang All-Stars, and Don’t Bite the Sun. The last two in particular would have fulfilled the category for me had it existed in last year’s Bingo.

#**Books I Loved**

***Gods of the Wyrdwood,*** by R.J. Barker  
**I read it for:** Druid (HM) - perhaps stretching the definition, but I thought it fit.  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series, Criminals, Prologues and Epilogues (HM), Multi-POV, arguably Eldritch Creatures (HM), Reference Materials.

R.J. Barker is an absolute wizard at marrying worldbuilding with characterization and narrative. Many authors create imaginative worlds that are in reality just new polities or magic systems papered over a world fundamentally similar to our own, and then populate it with characters who seem to take the same axioms of life for granted as we do. Not so in Barker’s equally excellent *Tide Child* books, and not so here - the world of the Wyrdwood is a truly foreign one, and the people that populate it feel as if they are genuine products of that world, steeped in all its alien mores and expectations.

I was enraptured by *Gods of the Worldwood* from start to finish, and will be reading the sequel as soon as it comes out this fall. 

***

***Between Two Fires,*** by Christopher Buehlman  
**I read it for:** Horror (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** Dreams, Prologues and Epilogues (HM), Survival, arguably Eldritch Creatures (HM).

I’d never thought of myself as a horror guy, so to have this square produce a contender for my favorite book of the year was a delightful surprise. *Between Two Fires* is weird; it’s on the one hand an extensively researched book about the disintegration of society during the real life Black Death in medieval France, while on the other being a story about biblical Satan and the hordes of hell romping around Earth while they think God’s not watching. It’s got monsters galore, it’s got people acting just as bad as the horror monsters that surround them, it’s got a truly insane ending that I will not spoil here. It’s phenomenal.

***

***A Conspiracy of Truths,*** by Alexandra Rowland  
**I read it for:** Queernorm Setting (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series, Under the Surface (I think?), Criminals, Bards, Dreams (HM), Reference Materials, Book Club.

Chant, the main character, belongs to an order of itinerant storytellers, who traverse the world learning stories from each culture and telling those stories to all those who want to hear them. While we get to hear a great number of these stories, we do not get to see many of the cultures that spawn them, as Chant is arrested before the book even starts, and spends essentially the entire time moving from one place of captivity to another, frantically trying to weasel, horse trade, and manipulate his way to freedom. 

I’m a sucker for stories about stories and about storytelling, and about the way societies treat stories and storytellers. A Conspiracy of Truths was basically made for me. I loved the unconventionally static setting of the book, the glimpses of fantastic realms we see through Chant’s storytelling, and most of all the steadily growing loss of sympathy I felt for Chant and his actions throughout the book.

#**Books I Liked A Lot**

***The Sarantine Mosaic,*** by Guy Gavriel Kay  
**I read it for:** Mundane Jobs (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series (Sailing to Sarantium), Dreams (HM), Prologues and Epilogues (HM), Multi-POV (HM), Published in the 90s (HM). 

Note: I read the omnibus edition of the duology, and counted it as one work for things like POV characters, prologue/epilogue, etc.

Guy Gavriel Kay is deservedly well-regarded and pops up frequently in the discourse of this subreddit, so I won’t bother reviewing in too much detail. For those who enjoy Kay’s formula of history with a “quarter turn to the fantastic,” this is a first class addition to his oeuvre, probably my favorite of his after *The Lions of Al-Rassan*. For those who don’t, it’s more of the same.

***One Hundred Years of Solitude,*** by Gabriel García Márquez  
**I read it for:** Magical Realism  
**2024 Possibilities:** Dreams (HM), Author of Color, Set in a Small Town.

It’s billed as an all-time classic, and I think it lives up to that promise. Not much more to say that hasn’t been said a thousand times before. The guy won a Nobel Prize for Literature for crying out loud.

***Labyrinth’s Heart,*** by M.A. Carrick  
**I read it for:** Sequel  
**2024 Possibilities:** Dreams, Criminals, Prologues and Epilogues (HM), Romantasy, Multi-POV, Reference Materials (HM).

I read all three books in this trilogy back-to-back (the first one counts for First in a Series!) and they all blended together, so this is more just musings on the trilogy as a whole.

The *Mask and Mirror* trilogy is really dang good. It’s got crime and conspiracy galore, one of the most fascinatingly nuanced cultures I’ve ever read for a fictional city, plots that are satisfyingly contained within each book but nonetheless well foreshadowed and connected across the trilogy, an excellent romance, found family, the works. I liked this series enough that I spent a good half hour after finishing it with Wikipedia and Google Maps trying to find the real city that Nadežra is based on (I’m pretty sure it’s Zadar, Croatia). I think the trilogy taken together would get bumped up to the Books I Loved category. 

My one nitpick would be with the sheer number of lies and secret identities that pile up on one another. For the most part they are tense and gripping, or sometimes absurd enough to be hilarious, but once in a while it felt like there was just one layer too much and the actual plot was getting lost as everyone stumbled around in a haze trying to uncover each other’s secrets.

***The Rook,*** by Daniel O'Malley  
**I read it for:** Title with a Title (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series, Dreams, Character with a Disability (HM), Book Club. Could make arguments for Survival (HM), and the letter but not the spirit of the law for Entitled Animals (the title refers to the chess piece, which appears to be etymologically unrelated to the bird).

Does anyone know what’s going on in Britain that makes all their urban fantasy about how the supernatural is very real and very scary, but not nearly so scary as the inevitable governmental bureaucracy that deals with it? I’m not sure, but between this and Charles Stross’ even-bleaker *Laundry Files* series I can’t say I’m eager to follow any career paths that might lead me into civil service across the pond. 

Engagingly written, with a strong pair of mysteries that each unravel the other - who is the traitor in the Checquy, and who was Myfanwy Thomas before she lost her memory? Amnesia stories can be very tricky to pull off, but I thought this one was handled excellently. 
***

***The Justice of Kings,*** by Richard Swan  
**I read it for:** Book Club OR Readalong Book  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series, Dreams, Bards (technically, due to the framing device), Prologues and Epilogues, Character with a Disability (alcoholism), Eldritch Creatures (HM), Reference Materials.

I don’t know that the *Empire of the Wolf* books are for everyone, but they were certainly for me. The central theme of the books revolves around the relationship between law and empire - how the benefits of law can or cannot justify the sins of empire, and whether the protections of the law can remain in place even as the empire which built it collapses.

For all the action-horror of the books themselves, there’s a lot of philosophy going on throughout. Despite one thematic choice regarding the overall cosmology of the world in the third book that I thought undermined an unfortunate amount of the trilogy’s main thesis, I spent more time thinking about these books after finishing them than I did just about anything else I read this year.

***Don't Bite the Sun,*** by Tanith Lee  
**I read it for:** Features Robots  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series, Under the Surface, Dreams (HM), Character With a Disability (HM), Reference Materials (HM).

This is a quick little novel, as a lot of pre-90’s sci fi tends to be. I read it on a bit of a whim, based on the phenomenal title and cover and a vague recollection that I’d been meaning to read something by Tanith Lee. I have rarely if ever felt so attacked in my life as I did reading this book. Though it was written nearly half a century ago, reading it felt like Lee had spent years tapping into my brain during the most listlessly depressive time of my college years.

#**Books I Liked**

***The Left Hand of Darkness,*** by Ursula K. Le Guin  
**I read it for:** Bottom of the TBR (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** Survival, Book Club, Dreams, Reference Materials.

It’s always a bit of an odd thing, reading a groundbreaking work with the benefit of decades of hindsight and societal growth. No one would call *The Left Hand of Darkness* revolutionary if it was published today. Changes in how we use pronouns to delineate gender, two and a half whole waves of feminism shifting expectations of the roles of both men and women in society, and countless other little anachronisms combine to make a lot of the book feel archaic. Yet the core of the novel - the examination and questioning of the functions that gender and gender roles play in a society - remains surprisingly fresh.

I felt like I did this book a bit of a disservice in how I read it; work was very hectic at the time and I only managed to get through it in little sips and spurts, which made it difficult to get into the flow of things. I think if I had been able to read it in longer sittings it would have jumped up a tier.

***Untethered Sky,*** by Fonda Lee  
**I read it for:** Mythical Beasts (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** Author of Color.

Something in my paleolithic pack-bonding DNA always enjoys a good boy-and-his-dog story, and Untethered Sky is an excellent addition to that genre. In this example, the boy is an orphaned young woman named Ester, and the dog is a roc - a massive bird of prey trained to hunt and kill the man-eating manticores would otherwise kill with impunity across the kingdom, the same creatures that killed Ester’s family. Though there is good stuff about Ester’s coming of age and her friendships and fallings-out with her fellow roc-tamers, the core of the story lies with the tenuous bond of trust and love between Ester and her own roc, and what happens when the cruelties of the world test that bond.

***The Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi,*** by Shannon Chakraborty  
**I read it for:** Coastal or Island Setting (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series (Depending on the release date of book 2), Alliterative Title (HM), Criminals, Book Club or Readalong Book, Dreams (HM), Prologues and Epilogues (HM), Reference Materials (HM).

I’ve always felt like there are two major axes along which I rate my enjoyment of books: the amount of fun I had reading them, and the amount they made me think. By pure fun, this was one of my favorite books of the year. It’s a delightful nautical romp, a getting-the-band-back-together story with a genre-appropriately colorful cast of characters, a despicable villain, and enough skeletons in everyone’s closets to fill a graveyard. It got put in this tier because it was only that. I had a great time reading it while I was reading it, but as soon as I finished it vanished from my brain. I’ll be excited to read the forthcoming sequel when I’m in the mood for another romp, but I’ll most likely need to read a plot summary of this one before doing so.

***Thornhedge,*** by T. Kingfisher  
**I read it for:** Myths and Retellings (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** Under the Surface, Dreams (HM), Prologues and Epilogues.

*Thornhedge* was not the first fairy tale retelling or pastiche I’ve read by Kingfisher, and, so long as she keeps writing them, it will not be the last. Her style falls comfortably in the middle ground between the poles of the often dark and moralizing tales of the brothers Grimm and their ilk and the much more saccharine happily-ever-afters of Disney. *Thornhedge*, like her other works, retains that classic fairy tale aura while still feeling fresh and grounded in the modern day, avoiding the pitfalls of both tired retreads and gratuitous edginess.

***The Killing Moon,*** by N.K. Jemisin  
**I read it for:** Middle Eastern SFF  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series, Criminals, Dreams, Author of Color, Prologues and Epilogues, Multi-POV.

I came into *The Killing Moon* with high expectations - both her *Inheritance Trilogy* and *Broken Earth* books rank among my all time favorites, and I hoped that *The Killing Moon* would be similarly spectacular. Unfortunately, while there is some genuinely excellent stuff to be found here, it’s often stifled by the book’s unfortunate pacing and lack of focus. It felt like Jemisin had two major themes she wanted to explore, but the book ended up not being big enough to contain both of them. If it had been a third again as long, it could have done justice to each, and if it had been slashed by a third she could have really honed in on just one, but as it was the whole thing felt all over the place and frustratingly dissolute. The book’s problems did not prevent me from liking it, but they did prevent me from loving it, and were all the more aggravating for how truly brilliant her other books are.

***A Shadow in Summer,*** by Daniel Abraham  
**I read it for:** Published in the 00s (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a series (HM), Alliterative Title, Eldritch Creatures (HM), Dreams (HM), Prologues and Epilogues, Multi-POV (HM), Reference Materials.

This was more or less the polar opposite of *The Killing Moon* for me - an extremely well crafted book by an author I had only middling expectations of. However, despite being technically impressive, it was frankly a bit too heavy for me to enjoy wholeheartedly. The entire book revolves around selfish and power hungry people doing terrible things to others in pursuit of their own goals, and features a nonstop carousel of grim topics - slavery, sexual exploitation, industrialized child abuse, genocide, and of course the plot’s central conspiracy - >!tricking an innocent woman into having an abortion without her consent or knowledge in order to drive a man to suicide!<. Yeesh.

***Lent,*** by Jo Walton  
**I read it for:** Angels and Demons (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** Criminals (if you count excommunication), Dreams.

What a delightfully odd book! *Groundhog Day*, set in a meticulously researched and lovingly portrayed late-fifteenth century Florence. The pacing was so wack as to be essentially absent, the acceptance of Girolamo’s friends when he explains his situation to them in each subsequent life was difficult to credit, and the ending made little sense, but this was the kind of book that’s so wonderfully unlike anything else I’ve read as to make all the little flaws seem negligible by comparison.

***The Will of the Many,*** by James Islington  
**I read it for:** Multiverse and Alternate Realities (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series (depending on sequel release date), Under the Surface, Criminals, Dreams (HM), Prologues and Epilogues, Reference Materials (HM).

I thought this was pretty good! I didn’t think it was great, and the level of buzz I saw after reading it myself took me aback a little, but I certainly enjoyed it. The majority of the book is really just paint-by-numbers magic school/dystopia stuff, executed competently but mostly forgettable beyond the fun quasi-roman trim. The ending, however, took a hard left turn into some much weirder and more interesting stuff. I’ll be reading the sequel and hoping that the series as a whole will be following that last-minute swerve.

***Burning Chrome,*** by William Gibson  
**I read it for:** Five SFF Short Stories (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** Five SFF Short Stories (HM), the titular novella qualifies for Criminals (HM).

Pretty hit or miss, frankly. There were some excellent stories, some that probably were excellent but have not held up so well to the progress of technology or society, and some that were just not for me. I’m glad I read it, as there’s a lot in there that you can tell played a big role in setting the foundations for cyberpunk as a whole, but there wasn’t much that really hit me right in the gut the way the best SFF short fiction can.

***Houston, Houston, Do You Read?,*** by James Tiptree, Jr.  
**I read it for:** SFF Novella (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** Alliterative Title. 

Speaking of the best SFF short fiction, let’s talk about James Tiptree, Jr. I realized while writing these reviews that I screwed up how I shuffled things around for Bingo submission: I ought to have put something else in this category and bumped *Burning Chrome* out of it’s Short Stories slot in favor of *Her Smoke Rose Up Forever*, the transcendent Tiptree collection in which I read *Houston*. James Tiptree, Jr. was a pseudonym wielded by one Alice Sheldon, and as I lack the space to give her wild life the detail it deserves, I encourage you to at least glance through her [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tiptree_Jr.).

*Houston* is a good novella that has the rotten luck to be ruthlessly outshone by its neighbors, collected as it is in one of the best short story collections I’ve ever read. Tiptree’s writing is sharp, incisive, sometimes even cruel in peeling back skin to reveal rottenness beneath. Far from seeming dated, as so many works in *Burning Chrome* did, the bulk of the stories in here are either timeless, or else only strengthened by the passage of time. Reading *Burning Chrome* lets the reader see how much society has changed; reading *Her Smoke Rose Up Forever* forces the reader to acknowledge how much it has remained the same. The collection as a whole belongs up in the Books I Loved category.

***Nova,*** by Samuel R. Delany  
**I read it for:** POC Author (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** Bards, Character with a Disability, Author of Color, Space Opera.

*Nova* is a lot, in a lot of ways. It’s intentionally grand, explicitly hearkening back to things like the Grail Quest of Arthurian legend and the Argonauts' hunt for the Golden Fleece, and deals with events meant to indelibly transform the power structures of an interstellar society. It elevates notions of omen and fate to equal status with technology and free will. Every character feels larger than life, more archetypal than individual. Yet it packs all this into less than three hundred pages, split between events both past and present. As a result, specifics of plot and character are often revealed more in broad outline than they are in detail, and the whole book is sort of impressionist, more reminiscent of a myth told by the fire-side than a traditional novel.

***Hench,*** by Natalie Zina Walschotts  
**I read it for:** Superheroes (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series, Criminals (HM), Bards, Character with a Disability (HM, but perhaps not in the spirit of things), Book Club/Readalong, Dreams (HM).

*Hench* left me torn - the premise of an outraged victim of collateral damage going on a crusade to prove that “heroes” cause far more damage than they prevent is a great one, particularly as American society continues to reckon with its relationship with policing. However, the way it actually approaches that premise, and particularly the ending, were not always as coherent as they could have been. The book often seemed torn as to how much it wanted Anna to be a Good Guy rather than just a protagonist, and this caused some weird narrative tension as her character arc of fully becoming a supervillain in her own right progressed. By the end of the book that question still feels muddy, and while things are set up for an interesting sequel I think it undermines the ability of Hench to stand on its own merits.

***The Captain***, by Will Wight  
**I read it for:** Self-Published/Indie Author  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series, Self-Pub/Indie, Prologues and Epilogues, Reference Materials

*The Captain* just barely made the cut for the Books I Like tier, and was saved more by the amount I didn’t enjoy reading my bottom three books than by its own merit. I enjoyed Wight’s previous *Cradle* books on that same Fun vs Thinking axis as *Amina al-Sirafi* - they are a lot of fun, but not much else. I still had some fun with *The Captain*, but this time it was not enough to make up for the lack of else. My central issue with the book is its departure from the formula I read *Cradle* for: Varic starts out literally from page one as one of the most powerful people in the galaxy, and kind of breezes his way through most everything he encounters. Sure, there are even more powerful threats on the horizon, but the fact that he’s topped out already makes each one feel like it’s going to be a puzzle rather than a journey to overcome them. I know Wight can write great journeys, but I haven’t yet seen the same appeal in the puzzles.

#Books I Did Not Like

***Chain-Gang All Stars,*** by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah  
**I read it for:** Published in 2023 (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** Criminals, Multi-POV (HM), Character with a Disability, Author of Color (HM), Survival (HM), Dreams (HM), Prologues and Epilogues, Reference Materials

I did not like reading *Chain-Gang All Stars*, but I didn’t dislike it as a book either. It has a lot of decent stuff and a lot of less enjoyable stuff that didn’t really do much to offset one another - the good was good, and the bad was bad, so it was hard to come up with a definitive final rating. Lots of thinking, no fun at all.

Adjei-Brenyah did a tremendous amount of research in order to make sure that all of his characters and the abuses and injustices they suffered closely parallel real events that happen daily throughout America - false accusations, racial sentencing disparities, guard-inflicted brutality in prisons, and countless other atrocities that make our carceral system a national embarrassment. However, the way that the explicating footnotes were so densely strewn throughout the text felt patronizing, like Adjei-Brenyah was afraid that without them we wouldn’t get that this fictional book about the barbarity of the American justice system was (gasp) actually about barbarity of the REAL American justice system! Perhaps I’m coming from a place of too much optimism, but I feel like I would have gotten it either way. Then again, while I might have “gotten it” regardless of whether the real names and stories were interleaved with the fiction, those real names and stories deserve to be heard, and putting them in footnotes made them much less likely to be skimmed through than had they been confined to an introduction or author’s note.

Ironically enough, the most frustrating part of *Chain-Gang All Stars* was the stuff that dealt with the gladiatorial combats directly. Adjei-Brenyah writes the combat in voyeuristic, even pornographic, levels of detail in order to force the reader into the same point of view as those in the story who eagerly consume deadly combat like any other sport. The problem is that it’s just… not very good to read. The fighters’ gimmicks and WWE-like personas, the slog of pages that are just people repetitively hacking into one another, it all felt lackluster. I’m not much of a combat sports guy, but I couldn’t imagine the nation becoming so hooked on this redwash drudgery that everyone just became ok with the death and cruelty involved.

***Fourth Wing,*** by Rebecca Yaros  
**I read it for:** Young Adult (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** First in a Series, Romantasy, Character with a Disability (HM), Survival (HM), Dreams (HM), Reference Materials.

My least favorite post on this sub and /r/books this year was the clone army of self-congratulating people going “I just don’t get how anyone could like this book.” I absolutely get how people could like it! Romantasy is often a lot of low-to-mid quality writing, rigidly formulaic genre conventions, and cast of largely recognizable stock characters. Oh, excuse me, did I say Romantasy? I meant LitRPG. Oh, excuse me, did I say LitRPG? I meant Wuxia webnovels. Oh, excuse me, did I say Wuxia webnovels? I meant -

Romantasy, as with LitRPG or approximately eight billion other subgenres with similarly dedicated fanbases and low barriers to self-publishing, is the way it is because that’s how people like it! Predictability can be comforting. Tropes get reused because people enjoy them. “Poor” writing is forgiven because writing quality isn’t an equally important criterion across genres. Romantasy is, frankly, much more able to churn out works with lasting or crossover appeal than a lot of reddit’s favorite web-based microgenres because, unlike them, it’s old and big enough to have a good buffer against Sturgeon’s Law.

I didn’t happen to enjoy *Fourth Wing* because I’m not really compelled by the trappings of romantasy. But it was massively popular for a lot of very good reasons, and acting like a *Fourth Wing* or something by Sarah J. Maas is any worse on some “objective” scale than one of the subreddit’s current books à la mode like *Dungeon Crawler Carl* or *The Shadow of the Gods* is just delusion.

***Tress of the Emerald Sea***, by Brandon Sanderson  
**I read it for:** Elemental Magic (HM)  
**2024 Possibilities:** Under the Surface, Bards, Character with a Disability, Prologues and Epilogues. 

This was, hands down, my least favorite book I read last year. Not just on the Bingo card; least favorite book period. I read a lot of Brandon Sanderson prior to 2020, but this is only the second thing of his I’ve read since then and it did nothing at all to convince me I needed to reverse that trend. The narratorial voice was grating and obnoxious, the characters were two dimensional cardboard cutouts, the writing was uninspired, and the ending felt insipid and unearned. It read like a children’s book, save for the fact that it was nearly five hundred pages long and required half a dozen tabs open to the dedicated Cosmere wiki in order for all the not-so-subtle nods to other Cosmere works to be anything other than smugly opaque. I’m glad *Tress* exists, as hundreds of thousands of people clearly love it, but it’s the only book on this list I regret reading.

1712319087.0,Can you tell if a writer is first and foremost a world builder?,"And do you think it affects the quality of the work? 

Coming back to the fantasy genre after having been out of it since my teens, I'm struck by how much people online seem to be into world building and magic systems. I just got recommended the world-building sub, and while really cool as a hobby, intellectual exercise or DnD resource, it seems that a lot of people there build worlds and magic systems for the purpose of later writing stories taking place in that world. I guess it's a valid way to inspire and kick start a story, but the emphasis people place on world cohesion and magic systems seems to me like it could just as easily choke out plot and characters with an overemphasis on the world and it's rules.

Even in this sub, it's a bit jarring to see people dismiss or recommend books because they like/dislike the combat system. For example, I see a lot of people giving Harry Potter crap for having a simple combat system instead of something more complex that can make fights last for pages. It reminds me of Naruto, where kids love watching the involved fights go on for episodes, but in the end, it harms the story pacing (imo). 

This emphasis on combat and world seems to be like a game-ification of a literary genre. And while such game-ified works can be perfectly fun and even great, I do think it makes it harder for a story to truly be as great as it could have been were it written by a plot or character author. 

On the other hand, this may very well be my old school perspective thinking that world-builders are different from writers. I mean, of course a world-builder and a writer can be incarnated in the same mind, but that's a dice roll. 

This got me thinking, what are some example of world-builders who happen to be great writers? And what are examples where the author was obviously a world-builder and the writing was tacked on?

One would think Tolkien is a good example of the former, but I'd disagree. Having just read the Silmarillion, it seems to me that Tolkien is clearly first and foremost a writer with a literary sensibility who's world came about as a result of the narrative he wanted to write. For example, as the world slowly unfolds from Eru onto the Valar, to the Maiar, to the Elves, etc. every element introduced seems to have a narrative function pertaining to Christianity, aging, faith, beauty, creation, evil, good etc. Its clear he didn't just sit down and was like ""cool, I'm going to draw an awesome map and make some races and write them a history"".

George RR Martin, whilst having a pretty fleshed out world, is very obviously a character writer. You could take all the characters and plot and transplant them in another universe, and it'd be just as good.

I have heard Sanderson being tauted as a world-builder, but I have not read anything of him besides Elantris, which I liked. Though it seemed more plot focused than world-building, but its a very focused setting.

Malazan part one. That's the most world-buildy book I've read. This is an example of what I mean. I heard it was even the result of decades of DnD sessions. On the other hand, his characters seem good so far. Maybe the rare world-builder who is also a great writer?

In the world of fantasy literature, film, games and art there are a few legendary beings that have become staples of the genre. Dragons and their treasures, elves and their forests, wizards and their sorcery etc. etc. But the vast pantheon of mythological creatures that spans across all sorts of cultures worldwide rarely gets the limelight of modern fantasy narratives.

Which brings me to my thought experiment: which lesser-known mythological creature do you believe deserves more spotlight in the fantasy genre? Are there any creatures or beings from folklore or mythology that you think could offer fresh narratives, challenges, or flavors to the worlds we love to escape into?

Whether it's a creature from Slavic folklore, an entity from African myths (Anansi and the Tokoloshi come to mind) or a spirit from some other Indigenous tales, there's a whole treasure trove of beings waiting to inspire new stories.

I wasn't planning on doing a full bingo roundup, but here are some random notes on what I read and what I planned to read.

**Title with a Title:** Paladin’s Faith by T. Kingfisher.

The third best of the four books in the series. Kinda romantasy, but still fun to someone who isn’t a romance reader (me). 4/5

*As planned?* No. Planned card had The Innkeeper’s Song.

**Superheroes**: Tigerman by Nick Harkaway

A superhero story for people who don’t like superheroes.  All the tropes are there, but slightly out of focus most of the time. 4/5

*As planned*? No. I planned to read Hench.

**Bottom of the TBR**: Nine Princes in Amber by Roger Zelazny.

I read the first five books of Amber. They’re all decent, but I think five is enough for me. I do like Zelazny, so I intend to read more of his work in the future. (Sidenote – Goodreads tells me Zelazny never fulfilled his early promise. Seems harsh for a legend of SFF).

*As planned?* No. That would have been The Shadow of the Torturer. Can we have a square that is just “read something by Gene Wolfe”? Otherwise I fear I will never get around to it.

**Magical Realism:** Morgenstjernen by Karl Ove Knausgård

A new star appears in the sky and somehow death is not a thing anymore. Not that anyone realizes, they are busy working, drinking and having their marriages fall apart. Knausgård is better when he sticks to plain realism. 4/5.

*As planned?* No. I had Midnight’s Children planned for this.

**YA**: I Shall Wear Midnight by Terry Pratchett

Tiffany Aching is growing up, takes charge of stuff and applies all she has learned from Granny Weatherwax. Wonderful novel, I’m really looking forward to reading this series to my daughters when they are a bit older. 5/5

*As planned?* Kinda. I had The Wee Free Men. I just picked the better book from the same series.

**Mundane Jobs:** The Midas Rain by Adam Roberts

This is a book that I read and marked down for this square. Apparently, it was ok. I have no recollection of it. 3/5

*As planned?* No, it was supposed to be Sunshine.

**Published in the 00’s**: The Big Over Easy by Jasper Fforde.

DCI Jack Spratt investigates the death of a bad egg. Quite literally, the victim is Humpty Dumpty. Did he fall off a wall, or was he pushed? What a fun story this was. I will be reading more of Fforde. 4,5/5

*As planned?* No. I had penciled in Boneshaker (this might have been me looking at a bone-themed card and just copying).

**Angels and Demons:** Small Miracles by Olivia Atwater.

A fallen angel tries to tempt a miserable woman into having a better time. Plenty of similarities to Good Omens, while still doing it’s own thing. Cozy, but not too saccharine or without any tension. 3,5/5

*As planned?* No. I had The Angel of the Crows.

**Short Stories:** Axiomatic by Greg Egan

Do you like ideas and cool concepts in your scifi? Look no further! Do you want to connect with the characters and experience great prose? This isn’t for you. Embarrasingly enough, I picked this up when Greg Bear died, because I can’t separate my Gregs. 3,5/5.

*As planned?* No, I was going to read a Sarah Pinsker collection.

**Horror:** The Strange by Nathan Ballingrud

A retro Mars colonization novel that took a hard turn into horror along the way. I wasn’t expecting it, but it worked. A Jo Walton rec, so of course I liked it. 4/5.

*As planned?* No. I was finally going to read one of T. Kingfisher’s horror novels. Maybe next year.

**Self-Published:** Murder on the Lamplight Express by Morgan Stang

The Bloodborne/Agatha Christie crossover I didn’t know I needed. Stang is my favourite new discovery of this bingo season. I hope there will be more Lamplight novels.  4/5.

*As planned?* I was going to read Waybound. Which I did, but it wasn’t very good, so I used this instead.

**Middle East:** Central Station by Lavie Tidhar

This was a good book. I hated it. Another author for the Valente zone. I rate it ?/5

*As planned?* Yes! Huzzah! But I didn’t like it, so not really a point in favor of planning.

**Published in 2023:** The Splinter in the Sky by Kemi Ashing-Giwa.

Meh. It was ok I guess. Didn’t really deliver on it’s premise. I have nothing interesting to say about it. 3/5.

*As planned?* No. But I read The Strange for another square, so the plan wasn’t completely abandoned.

**Multiverse:** The Kaiju Preservation Society by John Scalzi

You can’t convince me that this book had plot or characters. It’s all snark. The message was also about as subtle as a rampant Kaiju. Exhausting stuff. I’m deducting half a star for Wil Wheaton’s unsufferable narration. 1,5/5.

*As planned?* I really wish I had gone with my plan of The Space Between Worlds. There is no way that isn’t better.

**POC Author:** Kundo Wakes Up by Saad Z. Hosseini

We’re back in AI-run South East Asia. I liked the different view of the setting. Did not like the gaming couches. I’ll just have a normal couch, thank you very much.  Not as good as its predecessor. Too few djinn and/or Gurkhas. 3,5/5

*As planned?* No. I had Far from the Light of Heaven. Still plan to read it at some point.

**Book Club:** The Mimicking of Known Successes by Malka Ann Older

Sherlock Holmesian mystery. But set on Jupiter after Earth’s collapse. Also Sherlock and Watson are both women and there is some romance. Enjoyable. 4/5.

*As planned?* No. I did read Tooth and Claw, but used it elsewhere.

**Novella:** Walking to Aldebaran by Adrian Tchaikovsky

Space horror. I think Tchaikovsky has tried just about every SFF subgenre. He has written better novellas than this.  My enjoyment may have been tainted by listening to it while driving a five-hour detour to pick up a stuffed animal my daughter had left behind on holiday.

*As planned?* No. I had planned to read Ogres. So same author. Walking to Aldebaran was free on audible though.

**Mythical Beasts:** Tooth and Claw by Jo Walton

Jane Austen, but everyone is a cannibalistic dragon. Both satire and love letter to the genre. Not her best, but still a fun read. 4/5.

*As planned?* No. Was going for Untethered Sky. I think I dropped it because of pricing. I hate when novellas are $16.99 or something.

**~~Elemental Magic:~~** **Standalone:** Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh.

Yes, it’s a substitute. I didn’t like any of my possible choices for elemental magic, while Tesh came in with a banger I didn’t have an open spot for. Not what I expected at all, but strong contender for best book of the bingo year. Note to audiobook readers - the narration is great. 5/5.

*As planned?* Obviously not, I planned to complete the card without subs. Had A Plague of Giants here but can’t figure out why. I have zero interest in reading it now.

**Myths and Retellings**: Spear by Nicola Griffith

I put this off for a while because I thought I’d read enough Arthurian stuff. Bad call, this was great. I’m glad I listened to the hype. 5/5.

*As planned?* No, but also yes. I did read House of Odysseus as planned. Spear was just a much better book, so that is what made the card.

**Queernorm:** Furious Heaven by Kate Elliot

Genderbent Alexander in space continues, now well into the Persian campaigns. This is a massive novel with a lot going on. It threatens to be too much all the way through, but Elliot keeps it together. Barely. 4/5

*As planned?* No. That would have been Saint Death’s Daughter. The book I have looked at about 50 times, but never found myself interested enough in reading. If there is a bottom of the TBR square in ten years’ time, I’ll get to it.

**Coastal or Island:** The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by Shannon Chakraborty.

I like a good “getting the band back together” story. Piracy is fun, the setting was cool. Lots of things to like here. The ending was a bit meh. 4,5/5.

*As planned?* Yes. Although I started reading this March 31^(st) last year, so it was real convenient to slot in into the coastal square when the card came out the day after.

**Druids**: Darkspell by Katharine Kerr

The second book of the Deverry Cycle. I chose this over the first because it felt more druidy. The MC is a druid in all the books, but he does more druid things in this than in the others. I liked Deverry, but think four books are enough for me, and have no plans to continue. 3,5/5

*As planned?* No. I was going to read Dreamer’s Pool. Still haven’t gotten around to reading any Marillier. Maybe next time.

**Featuring Robots:** Echoes of the Ancients by Isabel Pelech

Worst cover of the year award. Fortunately a better book than the cover suggests. It deserves a wider audience than it currently has. This is a book I would never have found without a rec from u/oboist73. 3,5/5.

*As planned?* No. I planned on using the new Murderbot. I read it, and chose something I liked better instead.

**Sequel:** Priest of Gallows by Peter McLean

Grimdark fantasy gangster novel. With a lot of political maneuvering thrown in. The first book in the series was ok. As it went on, it became better. Listened to it, and really liked the narration. 4/5

*As planned?* No. I had Blade of Dreams. Still want to read it.

And that's it. 2/25 went as planned, one kinda went to plan and I read I few more planned books, but didn't use them for different reasons.

**In conclusion:** Planning seems to be largely pointless for me. I don't adhere to the plan. This is not a surprise. I am a mood reader above all, and will frequently jump into a book I just heard of while my TBR pile keeps growing. Regardless, I have planned out my card for 2024. Why? Because it is a fun way to kill a few hours in early April. And maybe this is the year that I actually make use of the plan. But probably not.

I recently embarked on a captivating journey into the realm of fantasy when I began reading ""The Final Empire,"" and it has reignited my passion for this genre. I'm eager to dive deeper and would greatly appreciate your insights and recommendations for a specific niche within fantasy.

I find myself particularly drawn to stories of imprisonment, such as ""Shantaram"" and ""Papillon,"" which masterfully capture the essence of struggle, resilience, and the quest for freedom. I'm curious if there are fantasy novels that evoke similar emotions and themes—books that delve into the complexities of finding meaning and liberation amidst adversity.

I'm looking for tales that explore characters facing profound challenges, venturing into the depths of darkness, and emerging transformed by their experiences. Stories that celebrate the human spirit's capacity to grow and thrive, even when faced with the bleakest of circumstances. Your suggestions for books that resonate with these themes would be immensely valuable to me.

But the modern world has so many markers to identify someone. Your social security, passport etc. How will they trick the system?

*Edit:* This blew up. I was away from my phone for a day and came back to so many responses. Thanks so much.

For clarity what prompted my question is, even if you have time on your side, not every average person can become a genius, or influential enough to create contacts in high places. Secondly, if you are an immortal, say in your early 20s or 30s, you would want to stay safe by keeping ot under wraps.

But when it comes to fictions and entertainment, i find very little realistic representation, most of the time it's done through romance and it feels so flat. Good examples i think are 2010s online games (though it was unpopular, i loved playing full supporting roles even for strangers), a good amount of characters in Steven Universe, Bartimaeus' POV in the Bartimaeus series and Gideon the Ninth in the Locked tomb series. There you can see sidekicks fully aware that they are mere sidekicks, they call their MCs on their shit, they act stupidly in their own short term interest or out of spite...

1712269302.0,I love when secondary characters get their time in the spotlight,"I was thinking today about some of the books, tv shows, games that I really like and one common thread between them is that they are not about the main character(s)' journey only.

I will give a few examples to illustrate my point

1- Stormlight Archive: I really like that the series takes advantage of its length to develop the >!Bridge 4 characters. At the beginning of Book 1, you feel that they are all similar, with no distinctions between one member and the next. But Sanderson made sure to provide a lot of the Bridge 4 characters with their own unique story, personality, background, and character arc. They are not just a support plot for Kaladin's story. And some of them even took center stage later on. I really like how Sanderson surprised us with focusing on tertiary characters sometimes, elevating them to secondary or even primary status. Some current secondary characters are even planned to become primary in later books!<. \*chef's kiss\*

2- Mortal Kombat: I see potential in this franchise story-wise, if a really competent author takes the current premise and characters and develops a solid narrative around them. But I digress. I really like the fact that in earlier games the male ninjas and female ninjas were simply color-palette swaps of a main ninja. But as the franchise progressed, each of these 10-12 characters diverged from the others in terms of background, personality and story. They became full-fledged characters and not just copycats. >!Ermac and Reptile now are not what they were in MK2 for example. Same for Jade and Tanya for example.!<

3- The Walking Dead: Also due to the fact that the TV series was long enough, it had the opportunity to elevate secondary and tertiary characters to main characters in later seasons, especially due to the fact that the show was a revolving door of leaving and incoming characters. F>!or example, Rosita used to have a couple lines in her first seasons, and as main characters quit the show, her place in the narrative evolved to become a quasi-primary character. And this applies to many other characters. They did not remain a secondary character like what happened with Astrid in Fringe!< or most non-main characters in non-serialised shows.

4- Damon Lindelof's shows: The main draw in his shows and why I would watch ANYTHING he makes, is that in Lost, the Leftovers and Watchmen, he dedicated each episode to a character, allowing us to get to know them under the spotlight. 

5- Gargoyles: its main draw is that all characters get their own episodes. Also for example The Pack starts as one unit and then each of its members' arc develops seperately.

1712267163.0,One Mike to Read them All: Advance review of “Goddess of the River” by Vaishnavi Patel,"This is a follow-up, though not a sequel, to Patel’s earlier novel *Kaikeyi*. In that, Patel took a relatively minor player in the greater epic of the Ramayana and retold things from her perspective. Here, Patel does the same trick; this time, it’s the goddess Ganga (otherwise known as the river Ganges) in the Mahabharata epic. As in *Kaikeyi*, I am totally ignorant of the source material. I know nothing at all of Hindu mythology, so I approached this book purely as a novel. Patel talks in her endnotes about the things she changed, but I’m not going to get into that - she can speak for herself. No doubt someone who is less embarrassingly ignorant on the topic would have a different perspective on the book than me.

The title character of the book, as I said, is the goddess Ganga. She doesn’t involve herself much with humanity directly; she’s more of a passive observer when the book begins, and not a particular fan of these short sighted, destructive humans building their cities on her banks. However, she is cursed to live as a mortal for a time, and marries Shantanu, king of Hastinapura. With him, she conceives a son that will later be known as Bhishma. The dynastic strife in the kingdom of Hastinapura, with Bhishma very much in the middle of it, is the focus of the Mahabharata.

Through most of the story, Ganga remains primarily an observer, though one who empathizes more and more with humanity despite herself. She loves her son deeply; he is a good man with a strong moral compass, but caught by an oath he swore as a young man to support the Kauravas during the dynastic struggles against the more righteous Pandavas. In the latter part of the book, time is mostly split between Ganga’s point of view and Bhishma’s.

The story told is rather bleak and depressing, as the rivals for the throne of Hastinapura tear the kingdom apart. Bhishma does his best to keep things together, and pursue a path of peace, but ever and again he is helpless (or so he tells himself) to stop things because of his oath of loyalty to the Kauravas. Shiva and Krishna also play a part in events, Krishna rather more directly (and Ganga doesn’t like Shiva very much at all). And while Bhishma struggles with despair and to figure out what the right course of action is, Ganga can’t do much besides offer him love and comfort.

Overall, it’s an excellent book. I enjoyed *Kaikeyi* quite a lot, and consider this one a step up even from that.

There was one moment I want to mention, that made me seriously consider putting the book down and walking away. The critical bit of context I was missing for those who don’t want spoilers (and thanks to /u/RuinEleint for providing it) is that it’s a not-uncommon trope in Hindu mythology for someone to have to die to escape a curse, which makes sense given the centrality of reincarnation. For those who want more details, here are some 2,000 year old spoilers: >!When Ganga was cursed to live as a mortal, there were 8 minor gods cursed the same. Ganga was to be their mother, and could return to her immortal form after giving birth to all 8. The first 7 she drowned in the river Ganges shortly after birth, freeing them of their curse to live a mortal life and returning them to their divine forms. Shantanu - who was ignorant of all this, and of Ganga’s true identity - stops her before she can drown the 8th, Bhishma. Reading about a mother lovingly, tenderly drowning her newborn baby was … challenging.!< Luckily it’s a short part of the story, and once I was through that it was clear sailing.

Strong recommendation. Looking forward to Patel’s next.

1712260743.0,Books with pure-hearted protagonist in a morally grey world,"Hi, I'm looking to scratch a particular itch of mine.

I wanted to read books that follow protagonists who are pure of heart and resolve, who are good people in a morally grey world.

It would be interesting to see how the world affects them, and how they impact the world for the better as well, in the book.

Basically a character arc where they grow and change, but their core ideals and principles do not become tarnished; ie, they don't turn into villains or extremely problematic anti-heroes.

But they do undergo change; their ideals get tempered with wisdom as they gain experience, and they have to compromise on some things as well.

Seeing how being in a morally grey world would affect them, and how their stubborn pursuit of what is right would affect people around them, would be a very interesting thing.

1712254431.0,Small Miracles by Olivia Atwater is pretty fun,"4/5, very fun and cozy read.

Small Miracles is about Gadriel, the fallen angel of petty temptations, trying to tempt a woman named Holly to do some petty sins. Read petty sins as ""have some fun"", because basically that's what it is. Holly is miserable and is afraid to do anything wrong, and because of a debt Gadriel has to another angel, she is tasked with making her happy.

It is such a nice and comfy read. It is very well paced, and is pretty short, making it a quick read. The prose is good, and fits the book very well. The book isn't a comedy, but what humor it has lands. Atleast for me every single joke landed and I laughed out loud multiple times. The character work is good too, and there were some scenes that genuinely made me smile without me realising that I was smiling immediately. The narration is very entertaining. The plot isn't anything special, but well, it is a cozy fantasy, I don't think plot is the most important thing in this genre.

The book has similar vibes to good omens, so if you enjoy that, or if you are in the mood for a cozy fantasy read this is for you. Highly recommended.

(I think this book fits in multiple squares for the bingo. It is indie, and has multiple POVs. I think I am going to slot in it for Indie because I am pretty sure I'll read other books with multiple POVs.)",Fantasy

1712247326.0,Confusing Names in Fantasy-Books - a rant,"I recently started reading  ***Malazan Book of the Fallen*** by Steven Erikson - and stopped after ten chapters. I like the story and characters, but the names are so confusing. Continents, Characters, Gods, the Magic system, Cities and races. All have names that sound like they were drawn at random out of a scrabble pouch. It got so bad I had to have an ipad with the wiki next to me, so I had any clue what was going on.

Don't get me wrong, WoT or SoIaF also has a slew of names and places, but they do a much better job in the worldbuilding department and explain as they go along - with Erikson it felt like he expected me to have a firm grasp on the world and setting before he started telling an interesting story. 

I don't need to have Jim-Bobs, Michaels or Lisas, but when just an excerpt from wikipedia of all characters startin with H reads like **Hood**  **Horult**  **Hostille Rator**  **Hulad**  **Huldo**  **Hulbat**  **Hull Beddict**  **Humble Measure**  **Humbrall Taur**  **Hunt**  **Hurlochel** you've lost me...",Fantasy
1712245763.0,"Greetings Reddit! I'm John Wiswell, award-winning short story writer, and I just released my debut novel, SOMEONE YOU CAN BUILD A NEST IN, from DAW Books. AMA!","Hi r/fantasy! I'm John, author of SOMEONE YOU CAN BUILD A NEST IN. I've been an r/Fantasy member for over a decade and am actually a two-time Stabby finalist, so I'm tickled to be doing my first AMA here. Hi friendos!

I'm currently a full-time writer. I'm disabled and ace/aro, and yes, both of those things influence my work a lot. As much as I ove writing, I remain smitten with reading, especially in finding new voices, which is why I make an annual list of my favorite short stories by other writers. I won the Nebula Award for Best Short Story for ""Open House on Haunted Hill,"" and the Locus Award for Best Novelette for ""That Story Isn't The Story."" I've also been a finalist for the Hugo, World Fantasy, and British Fantasy Awards, as well as the Stabby Awards. My short fiction has been translated into ten languages. I love kaiju, and monsters in general, and pro wrestling, and videogames (God bless Valheim, and I've platinumed every Miyazaki FromSoft game).

SOMEONE YOU CAN BUILD A NEST IN is a Fantasy novel from the point of view of the monster everyone is trying to kill. Shesheshen is a shapeshifting monster who builds her body out of unused parts. She's got a chain for a spine, rods for legs, and is always looking for a new mouth. After some monster hunters almost slay her, she's rescued by a strange and kindly woman named Homily, who mistakes Shesheshen for a fellow human. Homily nurses her back to health, and Shesheshen simply doesn't know how to handle a human actually treating her with kindness. The closer they get, the more they find they have in common. It might be love. But keeping her secret is tearing Shesheshen apart. She is about to confess when Homily reveals why she's in the region: she's hunting a horrible shapeshifting monster. Has Shesheshen seen it anywhere?

[The book dropped from DAW Books in Canada and the U.S. on Tuesday,](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/739891/someone-you-can-build-a-nest-in-by-john-wiswell/) and comes out from Quercus on April 11th.

Given its milestone anniversary, I've been feeling nostalgic in the lead up to this year's announcement. So I did what any reasonable person would do in that situation: I dug through every official post in Bingo's history to compile a timeline of Bingo's evolution and begged dozens of people who contributed to Bingo's history and evolution to talk with me about [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/)'s favorite yearly reading challenge.

You are about to read the results of that work. I present my Bingo retrospective.

# 2015 - Origins

On April 4, 2015 at around 7 pm EST, the [first Bingo challenge ever was announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/31ki25/rfantasy_2015_book_bingo_challenge/) by [u/lrich1024](https://www.reddit.com/u/lrich1024/). The sub was positively tiny back then with only around 70,000 users so the challenge may look like it only attracted modest attention with 70 or so upvotes and around 200 comments but believe me, it was huge for the sub at the time. Comments were enthusiastic and supportive with many people talking about what square they were most excited to try.

Even in its earliest form, you can see nascent themes that would drive Bingo for years to come. A desire to increase sub participation (Square 6: Novel by an [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/) AMA Author), an interest in bringing attention to underread authors (Square 10: Novel from [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/)'s Underread and Underrated List), and a focus on diversity (Square 4: Novel by an Author on [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/)'s Women in Fantasy List and Square 7: Novel Originally Written in a Language Other Than English). You can even see most of the staple squares were there from the very beginning with the debut of Self-Published Novel, Novel Published in \[Current Year\], 5 Fantasy Short Stories, and Any [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/) Goodreads Book of the Month.

I asked lrich1024 about why she decided to start bingo and what she expected from it:

>Well, like all my best ideas, it was created completely on a whim. It was around the time that there was another book challenge going around that everyone was complaining about because it promoted diversity in reading and another user (Krista) and I were talking about that on a post about it and how silly it was because there’s all sorts of reading challenges and you can either do them or not do them. Then I mentioned I had a done a book bingo the previous year and said something like ""Oh, I should make an [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/) book bingo"" and suddenly everyone was like ""you totally should!"" and the rest is history.

As with all new things, there were some growing pains as people independently fumbled their way towards ideas that are now staples of the challenge. As an example, the [first Bingo recommendation thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/3bnawy/the_what_should_i_read_for_this_bingo_square_post/) didn't get posted until June 30, almost 3 full months after Bingo's launch, by [u/juscent](https://www.reddit.com/u/juscent/).

What's striking about this early period is how far less communal the challenge was despite the sub excitement. The number of posts about Bingo from this time period are quite minimal. Most users appeared to just take the challenge at face value and not really seek much discussion about it. This is reflected in the participation rate at the end of the year. At the [time of the final thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/4ai37z/final_2015_rfantasy_bingo_thread_turn_in_your/), only about 80 people had turned in cards. It was a small start but there was clearly a lot of enthusiasm from people who had participated.

I asked a few users who had participated in Bingo every year since the start about their first Bingo. [u/unconundrum](https://www.reddit.com/u/unconundrum/) said this about their first Bingo:

>Honestly, I had no plans on participating in that first one but about a month from the goal, I realized I only had a handful of books left.

[u/improperly\_paranoid](https://www.reddit.com/u/improperly_paranoid/):

>I first stumbled upon Bingo when I was fairly new to the subreddit. I don't remember why did I decide to participate anymore (look, it's been almost 10 years lol) except that it seemed like a fun thing to try to do.

[u/kjmichaels](https://www.reddit.com/u/kjmichaels/) (me):

>I had been on [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/) for 2 years by this point and was just starting to get bored with the predictable recs. So when a big challenge popped up to shake me out of what was starting to feel like a reading rut, I jumped at the chance to participate.

[u/The\_Real\_JS](https://www.reddit.com/u/The_Real_JS/)

>I think back when bingo first started, everything was very fresh for me. I'd been on the sub for a few years at that point and was fairly involved in things, so bingo was of course something I was going to do. It wasn't even a very hard sell; I knew others who'd done reading bingos outside of [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/), and I'd wanted to give it a shot.

For all the excitement around the initial post, Bingo didn't take up much space outside of the first and final posts. People did not post reviews of their Bingo reads as much and there were relatively few threads where people tried to find books to fit the squares. I'm not sure how much of this is due to these first squares potentially being easier than later squares versus the fact that Bingo was not as communal as I said earlier.

The final turn in thread was posted [midway through March 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/4ai37z/final_2015_rfantasy_bingo_thread_turn_in_your/) and users had to manually type up their entire card to submit it. It was definitely a clunky way to do things but due to the small participation size, very doable. There was no tracking for how many people submitted cards but from manually counting submission comments in the turn in thread, I estimate just over 80 people participated.

# 2016 - Becoming Official

[2016's card debuted on April 1st](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/4cuyu2/rfantasy_2016_book_bingo_challenge/) and that has been the official start date of Bingo ever since. This year saw the debut of the Graphic Novel square which would be a staple square for several years. The biggest change from the previous year is that the 2015 Bingo assumed all of its squares were self-explanatory but the 2016 Bingo now includes a lengthy text section explaining each square as best as possible -- a mistake which has haunted Bingo ever since and led to endless litigation over what counts for each square. The re-read rule was also introduced allowing users to use one book they had already read previously as a square filler. Additionally, a FAQ was also added to address recurring questions from the previous year. Lastly, [u/lrich1024](https://www.reddit.com/u/lrich1024/) closed out the post with a heartfelt thanks to the Bingo community and since then all official announcement posts end with a similar message of positivity and brotherhood.

The recommendation thread was adopted as an official part of the Bingo process and [posted the same day as the announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/4cwki6/recommendations_for_rfantasy_2016_bingo/) by [u/lyrrael](https://www.reddit.com/u/lyrrael/), enabling users to plan as efficiently and quickly as possible. What's striking to me seeing this earliest official rec thread is that it's already in its mostly current form. The OP posts the thread and makes individual comments on each square so users can suggest books for said square. There wouldn't be another major innovation to the Rec thread until 2021. I asked [u/lyrrael](https://www.reddit.com/u/lyrrael/) about what it was like incorporating the Big Rec thread into part of the official workload:

>[r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/) was a lot smaller at the time and I really wanted people to be exposed to books beyond the obvious books that are recommended all the time. At the time, I was spending a lot of time writing recommendation lists for literally anyone who had a question and was getting all the obvious answers. I still do this, but on a much smaller basis. When I heard lrich was working on a bingo challenge, I got really excited about the possibilities of exposing people to books, genres, and authors that were beyond the prominent discussion and latched on hard.

A burgeoning problem with the rec thread was that some users didn't read the post instructions and so there were always stray comments breaking the post rules. The most common issue is that recs have to be in response to a square prompt comment but plenty of users make a separate top level comment to just rec a single book for multiple squares. Bingo would eventually find several alternate approaches to solving this problem in later years.

On the user end, the challenge started to develop a slightly more communal bent. People began to improvise their own shared methods of tracking bingo progress. [u/alexsbradshaw](https://www.reddit.com/u/alexsbradshaw/) had produced a tracking sheet in 2015 and, after users asked about it, provided an [editable copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19k9tua3e7Zx0nOsOrkfHG8ka5WS3Vo6KlZ7WKuOnmow/edit?pli=1#gid=406530917) for everyone in the comments of the 2016 announcement thread. This would eventually lead to a yearly tradition of fan made resources being prepped for each subsequent Bingo year but at this stage, there were only a smatter of options.

Another major innovation from 2016 was [the now much loved Bingo Stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62sp9h/2016_fantasy_bingo_statistics/). [u/FarragutCircle](https://www.reddit.com/u/FarragutCircle/), then a fairly new user, analyzed all of the turned in cards and shared info about each square like gender breakdowns in reading, number of unique books read per square, and what the most popular books for each square were. Farragut had this to say about his decision to run stats:

>In the comments to the turn-in thread for the 2nd Bingo (2016, posted in 2017), someone had asked lrich1024 a question about the most used author, and she didn't know. But I thought ""I bet I could figure it out.""

From these first Bingo stats, we have our first official tally of Bingo participant: 145 users. A solid based from which to grow over the coming years.

# 2017 - Chugging Along

[The 2017 card](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/62s73d/rfantasy_2017_book_bingo_challenge/) featured a few minor updates to the 2016 card. The staple square Graphic Novel was changed to Graphic Novel or Audiobook to account for visual impairment.

2017 was the first year users became really involved in helping boost Bingo via resource creation that was ready right at the start of the year. Several users either contributed graphics or tracking sheets to the running of Bingo to make it easier for everyone. [u/thequeensownfool](https://www.reddit.com/u/thequeensownfool/) unveiled [a fancy Bingo visual](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/63ts7q/i_made_some_fancy_bingo_cards_for_your_usage/) while people like [u/shift\_shaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/shift_shaper/) and [u/Millennium\_Dodo](https://www.reddit.com/u/Millennium_Dodo/) both provided tracking sheets. [u/thequeensownfool](https://www.reddit.com/u/thequeensownfool/) had this to say about making resources for Bingo:

>I discovered [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/) bingo when I was kinda in limbo. An arm injury made my previous hobbies impossible for a while so I turned back to reading. What I loved about bingo was how it helped me read widely and introduce me to a group of online fans I could share my love with. It helped me tailor my reading to what I was actually interested in, instead of bouncing off the best-sellers list like I'd been doing.

It's difficult to imagine Bingo now without the fan-made resources. I can personally attest that [u/shift\_shaper](https://www.reddit.com/u/shift_shaper/)'s tracking sheet has been my go to tracker for years at this point. I asked them about what led them to making their sheet and here was their response:

>I use spreadsheets for pretty much everything. So, when I first got into Bingo, I set up a sheet to track my own progress and fill out my card and it kind of evolved from there. I showed it off to one of my book friends, and they (gently) suggested the obvious - other people would probably find it helpful as well. The rest is history. I will also say that I thoroughly enjoy the challenge each year of keeping it up-to-date and trying to add in features that other [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy) members suggest.

Author Krista D Ball maintained the big rec thread in this early period and had this to say about it:

>I genuinely enjoyed—indeed, looked forward to—running the unofficial Bingo recommendation lists. It remains one of the most positive parts of my decade-long history on [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy).

The [2017 Stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/89esvx/2017_fantasy_bingo_statistics/) show that 228 users participated this year. A significant jump from the first year.

# 2018 - Becoming an Institution

2018 saw a big change to the Bingo announcement in the introduction of the now recurring [April Fool's announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/88q6cq/rfantasy_2018_book_bingo_challenge/). From talking around to various Bingo people, it seems that the first April Fool's thread was masterminded solely by [u/lrich1024](https://www.reddit.com/u/lrich1024/) but that subsequent Bingo threads were handled collectively by the mod team with one user taking lead in writing to the agreed on theme and the other mods providing feedback and ideas. Here's what she had to say about starting the April Fool's thread:

>Funny thing about the April start: I was originally going to wait until the next year rolled around and start then but one of the mods at the time (probably [u/MikeofthePalace](https://www.reddit.com/u/MikeofthePalace/)) said ""just start it the beginning of the next month"" which happened to be April. I don’t exactly remember what spurred on the first April Fool’s day Bingo card except that people were looking forward to it and thoughts were bandied about that it would be fun to put up a fake card and watch as it slowly dawned on everyone.

The [official 2018 thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/88rtlr/official_rfantasy_2018_book_bingo_challenge/) also featured a number of new innovations to Bingo. The biggest one was the introduction of Hard Mode options to voluntarily make the challenge harder on yourself if you chose. With this add on came a change to make Bingo slightly easier: the substitution rule that allows users to swap out one square for any square from a previous Bingo sheet. Clearly, Bingo was trying to find the right balance between enabling users who wanted a serious challenge while also helping users for whom reading 25 books in a year was already a pretty steep challenge.

At this point, Bingo was on its 4th year of running, had found its groove as a recurring community feature, and was a fully absorbed part of the mod workload. It was now just as official as any Top Novel poll or Stabby award thread. The details are a little murky at this point but I believe 2018 is when the first official Bingo team was created behind the scenes to help lrich run Bingo. I can't fully tell if it was created prior to the 2018 announcement or if it was created during this stretch prior to the 2019 announcement but either way it appears that the Bingo team came into full existence during the 2018 calendar year. Essentially the mods spun off a side group that was responsible for all things Bingo and help run all the various features that had gotten too big for any one use to handle on their own. There had been intermittent help from random users throughout the years but this would have marked the first time there was a dedicated group working in tandem to host Bingo.

This was also the first Bingo [u/happy\_book\_bee](https://www.reddit.com/u/happy_book_bee/) participated in who will eventually become a major Bingo figure in a few more years. I asked her about what drew her into Bingo and here's what she had to say:

>Bingo came into my life at a weird time. I was recently graduated from college and starting my first full time job at a law firm. I suddenly was no longer required to read books decided by my classes (though, to be fair, I did read some incredible books via my English and Creative Writing classes) and I had…. Time?

The [2018 Final Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/b3ip7o/official_final_2018_rfantasy_bingo_thread_turn_in/) featured the introduction of the first ever Official Submission Form for Bingo. Yet another mark of Bingo's growing popularity, it was no longer feasible to have every participant simply post their card in the comments. Going forward, this retrospective will stop featuring Final threads because they become less interesting without cards to check out.

The [2018 Stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/bbm35a/2018_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/) reveal that 264 users participated.

# 2019 - Bingo Turns 5

The [2019 official thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/b83fs8/here_it_is_the_rfantasy_2019_book_bingo_challenge/) featured the announcement of Hero mode which added the challenge of reviewing everything you read for Bingo during the course of the year even if it was only a single sentence review. The [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/) Book of the Month square was also expanded to allow users to pick a book from any book club or readalong past or present.

The [April Fool's card](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/b7x69e/official_rfantasy_2019_book_bingo_challenge/) this year was Australia focused and authored by [u/Megan\_Dawn](https://www.reddit.com/u/Megan_Dawn/). It included ""OFFICIAL"" in the title to help sell the joke but later April Fool's cards would drop ""OFFICIAL"" from the title to help users better distinguish between the April Fool's card and the Official card.

Behind the scenes, Bingo collaboration was in full swing. While [u/lrich1024](https://www.reddit.com/u/lrich1024/) remained the main driver, an official Bingo team of experienced mods was handling the majority of upkeep and answering questions wherever possible. Perhaps the most notable example of how big Bingo had gotten can be seen in how many people had to help launch a successful Bingo release day at this point. Farragut had this to say about the challenges of running a successful release day for Bingo:

>The main thing we needed to do was to 1) finalize the new card, including whether the square descriptions and (later) the hard modes made sense, 2) lock the turn-in form, 3) post the new card, 4) post the big list of recommendations (after [u/KristaDBall](https://www.reddit.com/u/KristaDBall/) doing that one for a couple years). We managed the moving parts by a lot of volunteer work stepping up to help lrich1024 and expanding to about half of the mod team during ""crunch time."" \[ed. note: ""half the mod team"" would mean about 6 to 8 people at this point\]

There aren't really innovations to discuss when it comes to the [stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/gjq0ym/2019_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/) or [final thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/fj9cjd/official_card_turn_in_thread_for_2019_rfantasy/) but it's a good time to check in on the participant total. 296 people participated in this year, more than double the confirmed number of participants from year 2. All in all, a rather sleepy year that kept pace with previous years.

# 2020 - Bingo in the Time of COVID

[Bingo 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ft254j/official_rfantasy_2020_book_bingo_challenge/) came at an interesting time. A little more than a month in to a global pandemic, people were itching for something to do.

The [April Fool's card](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/fswksm/rfantasy_2020_bingo_challenge/) was entirely in French with an English translation provided at the end. As it turned out, the theme that year was Canada.

2020 was the first year of the Reverse Bingo Rec thread. The [original thread was deleted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/fu9lc9/reverse_book_bingo_recommendation_thread/) but luckily a [copycat thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ip2mwo/reverse_bingo_some_books/) by [u/VictorySpeaks](https://www.reddit.com/u/VictorySpeaks/) lives on. This was a solution to the problem of people trying to rec books for multiple squares in the Big Rec thread. The Reverse thread allowed users to post books they wanted to read for Bingo and users would tell them which squares those books would fit. The Reverse rec thread is still not an official part of Bingo to this day but users always generate at least one of these per Bingo year since 2020.

The [2020 Statistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/npvigf/2020_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/) saw a major change as [u/FarragutCircle](https://www.reddit.com/u/FarragutCircle/) announced his retirement from doing the stats every year. As Bingo scaled up, it had become difficult for any one person to keep up with the demand and so Farragut promised that while the data would be made available to enterprising users who wanted to do the stats for themselves, he personally had hit his limit. Farragut had this to say about his decision to retire:

>The biggest challenge I gave myself was usually the standardization--people tend to be very loose with how they write down authors and titles *(looking at you,* [/u/RuinEleint](https://www.reddit.com/u/RuinEleint/)), sometimes even mixing up who wrote what.

Farragut's 2020 stats were the last stats to feature a total number of participants (480, for the record). All future stats only listed number of cards or squares completed. It is striking though that Bingo in 2020 had nearly twice as many participants as in 2019. It's probably due to an explosion in people needing things to do caused by COVID happening.

# 2021 - Bingo: The Next Generation

[2021's April Fool's card](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/mhpp9k/the_rfantasy_2021_book_bingo_challenge/) was horror themed and is to date the most popular and upvoted prank card. Though the AF cards continue to be mostly popular, they're not without controversy. Some users complain about them every year since they arrive a few hours before the official card and it can take a minute to catch on that it's not the real card. I spoke to one such user, [u/RevolutionaryCommand](https://www.reddit.com/u/RevolutionaryCommand/) for a dissenting perspective on the April Fool's cards and perspective on how Bingo has evolved over the years:

>I just don't think it's funny, and given the repetition of the joke and the fact that the April's Fool card always gets me, it can get a little annoying. I'm always excited for the new bingo card, and then I get ""blue-balled"" every year. It's no big deal, really.

[The official 2021 card](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/mhz2tt/official_rfantasy_2021_book_bingo_challenge/) retired the staple square Graphic Novel or Audiobook. Users had regularly complained about having a permanent format restricted square and so it was finally dropped. There was also a significant visual update to the [Bingo card](https://imgur.com/a/SXrX7BV) as it went from seemingly being made in Microsoft Word to being made in Canva which made it nicer to post around the Internet. Another minor change is that the Daily Simple Questions and Recommendations thread was announced as the best place to get rulings on whether books would count for Bingo during the course of the year.

The [Rec thread of 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/mhz3k7/the_2021_rfantasy_bingo_recommendations_list/) got its first major innovation since it became an official part of the Bingo launch in the form of a navigation matrix. Instead of having to scroll for each square, users could simply click anywhere in the box to jump to that square and its recs. I reached out to the user who added the navigation matrix, me, and asked myself why I implemented the feature. Here's what I had to say:

>I thought it would cut down on the number of people commenting in the wrong place during the Rec thread. It didn't. But people loved how easy it was to use so we kept it anyway.

2021 was also the first year that the Bingo challenge was exported to Storygraph by [u/Nat-Rose](https://www.reddit.com/u/Nat-Rose/). The exporting of the challenge to Storygraph would be taken over by [u/hellodahly](https://www.reddit.com/u/hellodahly/) in subsequent years. [u/hellodahly](https://www.reddit.com/u/hellodahly/) had this to say about getting involved with fan resources:

>As I'm sure is the case with many people, Bingo really helped revive my interest in reading (along with [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy) in general). It is such a fun way to expand my reading horizons, and get recommendations for books in categories I never would have thought of like weird ecology or fantasy romance (it turns out I love them).

The biggest change to Bingo ever came in the [Halfway thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/pnad7q/2021_rfantasy_bingo_halfway_thread_and_special/). I've mostly avoided talking about the halfway threads because there's not much to say about them. However, this year was different. After several years of running Bingo, [u/lrich1024](https://www.reddit.com/u/lrich1024/) retired from her position of Bingo Queen and publicly handed the reins over to [u/happy\_book\_bee](https://www.reddit.com/u/happy_book_bee/) who has run Bingo ever since. Here's what lrich1024 had to say about retiring:

>I never really did bingo 100% alone. I bounced ideas off of others, friends I made in the subreddit, and later off the other mods. Bingo became more of a group project. People made various templates, helped count the cards, came up with a system for turning in cards to count them easier, etc. Bingo couldn't run without these volunteers. And coming up with squares…well I was always asking for suggestions! I only kept arranging the final card to myself because I loved to try and balance the rows and columns well.

The community largely handled lrich's retirement in stride, thanking her for her work starting this annual tradition and wishing her luck on any future endeavors. Happy book bee ably concluded the year's Bingo with the help of the Bingo team and if there were any complaints about her performance during this transitional period, they weren't in any of the official threads.

The [2021 Statistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ude8f4/2021_rfantasy_bingo_stats/) were taken over by [u/SeiShonagon](https://www.reddit.com/u/SeiShonagon/) with help from [u/fuckit\_sowhat](https://www.reddit.com/u/fuckit_sowhat/) and [u/ullsi](https://www.reddit.com/u/ullsi/). From combing the raw data, I was able to confirm that this year there were a stunning 665 participants.

# 2022 - Under New Management

[Bingo 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ttrev1/official_rfantasy_2022_book_bingo_challenge/) was the first year fully under [u/happy\_book\_bee](https://www.reddit.com/u/happy_book_bee/)'s stewardship. She made her new approach to Bingo known with the the introduction of modest democratic reforms to Bingo in the form of the [Bingo Vote square](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ta9yir/your_chance_to_vote_on_a_2022_bingo_square/). This now yearly post goes up at the beginning of the March before Bingo is announced and gives users the chance to select one of the 25 squares from 3 competing options.

2022 was also the year of the [Taylor Swift April Fool's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ttnxr4/the_rfantasy_2022_book_bingo_challenge/), a bingo card composed entirely of Swift song titles and references. This is just a couple dozen upvotes shy of tying with the Horror April Fool's card from 2021 for most popular April Fool's thread. I spoke to the main writer of the Taylor Swift card and here's what they had to say:

>The Bingo team looooooooves to work on April Fool's threads. When I was an official part of the team, it was pretty common for the AF threads to be pre-written long before the official threads because of how fun it was to work on them.

The [official announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ttrev1/official_rfantasy_2022_book_bingo_challenge/) was pretty standard by this point. As queen, happy\_book\_bee stuck very close to the common format of the previous announcements only changing out the squares and adding a new personal message of appreciation for the Bingo community to replace lrich's original personalized message.

I spoke to [u/happy\_book\_bee](https://www.reddit.com/u/happy_book_bee/) about what it was like finding her footing as the new Bingo Queen:

>I joined the mod team around the time [u/lrich1024](https://www.reddit.com/u/lrich1024/) was getting ready to retire from Bingo. Maybe it was just how passionate I was about the challenge but the other mods gifted me control of bingo almost immediately. A complete honor, though I quickly realized I was a little out of my depth.

The [2022 Statistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/12xs3c1/2022_rfantasy_bingo_statistics/) were taken over by [u/smartflutist661](https://www.reddit.com/u/smartflutist661/). Again, combing the raw data, we find that there were 742 participants in this year. In 8 years, Bingo had grown to be about 10 times as big as when it first started in 2015.

1712239307.0,3 Body Problem,"Just finished the Netflix series. Was astounded. Been looking for a show like this since Westworld. 

I love how the show is so hard to pitch to someone to watch, you think the show is one thing before the landscape and the horizon of the show dramatically changes. 

The characters are great and I was particularly blown away by the acting of Jin and the young Dr Ye in China.  The Tatiana character was also very captivating. 

Loved that Ramin Djawadi composed the music. The beautiful way he weaved in Video Game and the score used in the episode where Jin is running to get to Will before the procedure reminded me off the build up in The Night King score he used in Season 8 of GoT. Wish he got to do a proper title song for the show. 

In terms of criticisms the first couple of episodes are a bit slow (but I don't mind slow). The nano fibre attack of the ship on Judgement day felt way out of character for Auggie - she seemed to know what was going to happen and while she had reservations, you wouldn't think her character would ever allow her tech to be used in that way. The show also needed a few more emotional reactions and exchanges between the core cast.

But these criticisms are minor. Overall I loved the show. 

For those that have read the series, how much does the show cover of the books, does the first series cover the entirety of Book 1? Without spoilers (as much as you can) how different is it, would you consider it a faithful adaptation?",Fantasy
1712239128.0,"Review: To Green Angel Tower (Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn), by Tad Williams","&#x200B;

[To turn the stride of treading Fate, To clear the fogging mists of Time, If early shall resist to Late, Three swords must come Again ](https://preview.redd.it/jfgy7do7tgsc1.jpg?width=672&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72a7711394763abc8cdfa7a5be3ceb2445f75c3d)

&#x200B;

I said it on my review for the Stone of Farewell. THIS is how high fantasy should be written. To Green Angel Tower is the perfect conclusion to an adventure that has featured war, death, the loss of innocence, and the always enjoyable Quest. I think that The Dragonbone Chair *might* be my personal favorite novel in this trilogy, due to the slower pace and the greater focus on Simon. But I think that To Green Angel Tower is the best written novel in the trilogy. At this point Williams' seems to be at the top of his game when it comes to juggling a larger cast of characters, switching from one group to the next at just the right time, and juggling multiple (seemingly) unconnected plots at once. I'll talk about it more below, but this is a long book. So, you end up getting a good deal of development for different characters within the single volume. No one is unchanged from beginning to end and that's the way it should be. This book kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end, and as our heroes race toward the final confrontation with the Storm King I kept dreading the thought of any of them dying, while also being excited to see how things would finally end. This particular tale of Osten Ard ends up crossing that curious gap that sometimes exists between Myth and Fact, creating a tale that completely changes the way you look at all the adventures the characters went on beforehand. For fans of Lord of the Rings and other epic adventures this is the book for you.

&#x200B;

# Length

*I will say it once more, Seoman Snowlock. The story is not ended.*

The book is just over 1,200 pages, which makes it one of the longest books i've ever read. The trouble with reading such a long book is that because I couldn't sit down and just focus on it for a few days I found myself forgetting about certain events until they were mentioned again. In fact, I completely forgot about one of the major characters (Cadrach) because his part in the story ends about 100 pages before the halfway point and he doesn't show up again until right before the final battle. This is where William's switching between different groups was a smart choice. Outside of specific instances you're going to end up focusing on the same characters throughout. Even when Simon and Miriamele are travelling together for the latter half of the story the book jumps between Simon's point of view and Miriamele's, sometimes from one chapter to the next. This makes it easy to not lose track of the overall story, character motivations, arguments, etc. I'll also say that the way Williams' writes at least makes everything memorable once it's mentioned. So, while I forgot about Cadrach because so many things happened while he was off the page I immediately remembered the moment he had left when he was reintroduced. It's like how you don't always think about a friend, but when that friend is mentioned you can remember the last time you talked to him or her.

I can understand why some releases of this book split it into two parts.  If I had to guess the split in the book would take place sometime around when Miriamele and her companions arrive at the Stone of Farewell. Maybe right before Simon and Miriamele meet again. At least that's where I would split it since everything before then could almost have been given its own book entirely and everything after that is heading toward the final conflict.

# Characters

*I was never meant to rule. It was agony for me, but I saw no other course but to try to push Elias from the throne. Now God has opened a door for me, a door that I believed forever shit. To die or to take the crown were my only choices. Now, I have been given another.*

&#x200B;

I won't make too big a deal out of it, because lord knows there's enough to talk about. But I have to take a moment to gush about how much I love all of the characters in this series! Simon (Seoman) is my favorite, because i'm a sucker for the Hero in any major work of Fantasy. But reading Miriamele suffer from the aftereffects of her time being abused by Count Aspitis tore me apart inside. I spend the entire novel being afraid that Tiamak might die like the rest of his people or predecessors in the League of the Scroll. I was almost tearing my hair out when Eolair would wonder if Maegwin loved him and at his inability to just talk with her about it. And Maegwin! Poor, poor Maegwin. I'm sure everyone has their own opinions, but I can't help but look at her as having the most tragic fate in the trilogy. Gradually driven to madness due to the loss of her kingdom and family, her own internal doubts dating back to childhood, and magical dreams which are real but which she honestly doesn't have the tools to understand! After a while I came to look at this story as placing Simon and Miriamele as counterparts to one another. I still feel that way, but I think Maegwin can also be used as a counterpart to Simon as well. She has the same natural aptitude for the Dream Road that Simon does, but lacks the allies and information that Simon stumbles onto during his journey. I knew in my heart that she was going to die before everything ended, but I was still devastated when she finally did.

I'm also impressed how well Williams' managed to balance the focus on all of these different characters. The previous book is more even, because everyone is separate for a time. By the end most of the different groups have united. So, what happens in this story is that when Simon is with Josua we'll still get portions of Simon being by himself. However, we'll also get Simon being part of conversations/meetings involving Josua, Simon giving his thoughts on Josua, or Simon speaking to Josua directly. This allows Josua to keep developing throughout the story as well. And this method is applied to every other major character. The specific point of view character might change, but the group of characters he or she is part of will still receive further focus. And this ends up being maybe the most important aspect of the story that allows the ending to be so satisfying. Had we stopped focusing on Josua altogether after the second book I think the last scene with him, where he lets the world at large believe he's dead, would still work. But because the story never stops focusing on his character and the struggles he has with leadership and royalty it works so much better.

\*I also want to say that I didn't foresee that ending. I was thinking that Simon would end up as Josua's advisor or new *right hand* to replace Deornoth. But him becoming King is just as good since it fits with his own journey, which was really one of gaining maturity and experience needed for such a position. So, I am happy for Josua. He really was an interesting heroic character. He wasn't an arrogant royal, cared more about history/lore  than anything else, but was consistently willing to step up and be a leader because its what people needed. He is worthy of being the Hero of his own epic fantasy adventure and that's another thing I have to give the writer credit for.

# Simon and Miriamele

*I've loved you so long, Miriamele.*

&#x200B;

Not sure if this is my new favorite relationship in fiction, but it's a contender. It really goes back to what I said previously about the story switching between different points of view. This is such an interesting pairing because they spend the majority of the story apart. And they aren't childhood friends or anything. There's no kind of decades long buildup to a relationship before the story starts. Williams had to establish that groundwork in the relatively brief time they travelled together in The Dragonbone Chair. He had to add to it during the Stone of Farewell, during which both characters also *kind* of dabble in relationships with other people and don't interact with one another at all. And he finally brings it all to a close here, after spending hundreds of pages still developing them as they once again travel together after having changed immensely since their separation in the first book. Yet at no point does the relationship detract from the overall narrative. Some stories will almost have an entire romance section of the book, in which that is what a few hundred pages are all about. To Green Angel Tower just rolls it in like it does every other event, as an organic part of the journeys these characters are experiencing.

Due to being the youngest characters in the story who we focus on it's only natural that these two also experience the most growth. Initially I was fearful that the two wouldn't really stand as equals. After all the first book ends with Simon facing and wounding a dragon to reclaim a mythical sword. What could Miriamele do to really top that? I feel that Williams had this in mind too. So, Simon gets to experience  the big battle at the Stone of Farewell in this book. But Miramele is the one who is on a ship being attacked by sea monsters in the middle of a storm (Now that I think about it that storm might've just been a hurricane). Miramele is the one who goes deep into the swamps and gets wrapped up in a side quest featuring giant crab monsters. Miramele is the one who comes across Camaris, the owner of the magic sword that Simon reclaimed at the end of the first book. Not to say it's a competition, but I do think there is value in both characters going through so much in terms of trials. It places them on even footing when it comes to the magical, horrible world that they find themselves taking part in. And the more...mundane (?) struggles are just as crucial in shaping them.

Essays could probably be written on the dichotomy between Miramele's abuse when dealing with Aspitis and Simon's time as a Knight under Josua. And while I said in my previous review that I don't know if Miramele's situation really needed to happen I do appreciate that there are true lasting consequences from it. Late into the story she is still effected by it. It's a bit of a pet peeve of mine when characters experience things that *should* be traumatic and just continue on in a series as if nothing has changed. When that's the result I really do feel the event was pointless. And i'd be willing to extend that to a character gaining or losing just about anything at all. If Simon becomes a Knight but doesn't grow from that event then why make him a Knight? If Miriamele isn't going to be changed by spending so much time with an untrustworthy fellow like Cadrach then why have her travel with him specifically for so long? Not to say that every single event needs to result in change, but the major ones should. And I appreciate Williams sticking to that for both characters. And the changes they undergo end up affecting one another because they influence how they relate to each other. Miriamele really doesn't know how to deal with a more mature version of Simon and when it's clear that he wants a different kind of relationship with her it clashes with her view of herself after her time with Aspitis. Simon is more confident when speaking with Miriamele, but that confidence and his experience in war gives him the ability to also argue with her about the Quest she decides to go on. Their interactions still mirror the ones they had in the first book, but they have suitably changed to fit the different people they have grown into.

There are also some excellent minor details peppered throughout that show their similarities. For example, both of them use the same term (Gotta paraphrase because I don't wanna look for the pages) of how something very specific will only happen when the stars shine during the day. For Miriamele this involves her trusting Cadrach and for Simon it involves his chances of becoming King. I think touches like that do just as much to show they are suited for one another as anything else. And some of those moments also happen in separate books, which makes it possible for you to miss them entirely.

# Cadrach 

*You once said...only trust me again...when stars shone at midday. You saw them. They were there.*

&#x200B;

I feel it would do a disservice to the author to not at least give Cadrach his own section. I  am not sure if there has ever been a more pathetic, wretched excuse for a human being who was also still *mostly* on the side of the good guys...I'm not sure. Might be better to say he wasn't on the side of the villains and just wanted to prolong his life as much as he could. He's a complex character and I love that about him, alright? Up until the end he is holding on to his secrets and self loathing, almost mocking everyone else for even thinking that they can stop the Storm King's plan. But he does come through when it matters most, while still not fully changing. And whether or not he redeems himself for his past actions is left entirely up to you as a reader, and its fitting that throughout the story Miriamele in turn is conflicted on her own feelings toward the fallen monk. I myself an conflicted on him in similar ways. As I mentioned in my review for the last book I feel he gave Miriamele every reason to doubt and dislike him. But he also makes compelling arguments at times and when the entire story of his life is laid bare, especially his torture at the hands of Pryrates, it's hard to judge him as if I would've been able to do any different in his shoes.  But he's also very frustrating because he holds important information that could potentially have saved lives had he shared it earlier in the series! But oh well. I have to applaud Williams for creating a character that makes me feel so many different emotions toward him, equally good and bad.

&#x200B;

# Chess

*Hatred kept him alive in the dark places. Five centuries, burning in emptiness. Hatred is all he has. And I have hated too. I have felt like him. We are the same....No creature in all the cosmos deserved what had happened to the Storm King.*

&#x200B;

When it's all said and done this entire trilogy really was just The Storm King and his forces playing chess with the land of Osten Ard wasn't it? Throughout each book the heroes are questioning exactly *how* they'll stop him. Oh, there are 3 great swords. Cool. How are we going to use them to kill someone who is already dead but can effect the world from beyond the grave? That's the big question and it's never answered, because the Storm King can't be stopped by the swords. It was all one big trick. A bluff that allowed him to get what he wanted. This is the only time I can think of where the big ancient prophecy doesn't help the heroes at all and works in favor of the villain, who seems to have set it up himself. And when it's all laid out for you at the end it makes sense. The heroes were pushed just enough to move them where they needed to be, but not enough to every fully overtake them. But because they really are that much on the backfoot the entire time they never have time to stop and think about it. Because they are all separated for such long periods of time they can hardly ever bring all of their information together and figure out what the enemy's real plan is. But across the story the details line up as to why things progress the way they do. Why does Thorn seem to have more traits associated with a stereotypical evil sword than a good magical sword when Simon wields it? Because it is an evil sword that will help resurrect the Storm King. These things almost seem obvious once you've seen the whole picture, but I have to praise the way Williams developed all of it.

And there's something to be said for how you can come around to such a simple ending from a complex plot. How does Simon stop the Storm King? Not by slaying him, but by relating to him, acknowledging the pain the Storm King had experienced, and refusing to hate his enemy. By doing so he cuts off the Storm King's ability to draw power from Simon's hate. This leads to Camaris forgiving himself for his sins, which cuts off another aspect of the Storm King's power. It's a very simple moment that takes Simon the entire series to get to, despite being moved around by the Storm King, or Pryrates, the entire time. Both of these story elements are perfect and really make the finale something special for me.

# Conclusion

*But everyone has suffered. Now is the time to gather strength, to try to understand and to decide what comes next.*

&#x200B;

That was a lot of writing and I still feel there's so much more to say. But that's how I felt reading the book too. ""THIS part is SO good and I can't wait to write a review on it and delve into why its great"". But I don't think anyone cares to read me go on and on about every little detail. I love the characters, the plot, the setting, etc. All of that stuff that makes a book what it is seems perfect to me. Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn is filled to the brim with intriguing characters caught up in events that were set into motion before any of them were born. At times it seems that the entire history of the world is being revealed to us, the readers, as the story plays out. It can be a lot to take in and seems daunting at times, but I think if you can stick with Simon and the rest through everything you'll come out of this truly appreciating the journey you shared with them!",Fantasy
1712238118.0,I like the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind,"Apparently people hate SoT, but I actually really like it. ( im female) I love the powerful women and the Mord Sith are my favorite! The story line does get a bit ridiculous, like defeating Communism with a pretty statue is just weak writing. I don’t mind the steamy scenes, the rape is a bit much but i understand the fantasy genre contains a lot of gore and rape. But overall, the series is pretty engaging and interesting I think. The Sister of Light and the Imperial Order are interesting concepts. As well as the magic system being additive and subtractive is interesting. The world building is very good imo. This was also the first adult fantasy book i picked up so maybe im biased…

What is everyone’s problem with Goodkind? (Besides him being a bit of pretentious ass. )
I actually think his writing is good and love the story!

1712233605.0,2024 Hugo Readalong: Announcement and Schedule,"The Hugo Readalong is back and ready to dive in to some 2024 finalists. As regulars have likely heard, there was more than a bit of controversy in last year's awards, and many Hugo voters (including most of us) are convinced the votes were not correctly counted. So why are we doing this again? Two reasons. First of all, those responsible for last year's catastrophe have been removed from positions of leadership, and the Glasgow Worldcon has committed to a transparency they've already begun to demonstrate in the [release of 2024 finalists](https://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2024-hugo-awards/). Second, it's a whole lot of fun to get together and talk about books. We're doing this for us. And for you. Honestly, the more the merrier. 

For those who have not participated in the past, let me provide a little background. Our habit is to spend about three months reading and discussing the Hugo Award finalists in the Novel, Novella, Novelette, and Short Story categories. This year, with the exception of one holiday week, we'll be dedicating Mondays to novels and novellas and Thursdays to short fiction. In addition, because of the relatively early release of the shortlist, we will be able to discuss a bonus category, and so six of our Thursday sessions will spotlight selections from the six finalists for Best Semiprozine. 

This is very much a drop-in book club, and while you'll see some regulars, anyone is welcome to come discuss books with us as much or as little as they like. There will be one discussion session each for the novels and novellas, whereas the shorter fiction will feature 2-3 stories per discussion session. 

This is the schedule we plan to follow:

Let me finish with a couple notes:

- You may have noticed three sessions marked ""TBD."" While we were easily able to find stories we wanted to highlight from three of the Semiprozine finalists, the Hugo Readalong organizers have read a little bit less from the last three, and we wanted to avoid repeating a discussion from Short Fiction Book Club (which read [Strange Horizons' Nebula finalist](http://samovar.strangehorizons.com/2023/02/27/a-short-biography-of-a-conscious-chair-breve-biografia-de-uma-cadeira-lucida/) back in February), given that the entirety of SFBC leadership is also Hugo Readalong leadership. We're happy to consider suggestions for the Strange Horizons, Escape Pod, and FIYAH spotlights, and if the annual Hugo Voter Packet is released sufficiently early, we will give extra consideration to the works highlighted there. We will make sure announce the stories up for discussion at least two weeks prior to the session. 
- The short fiction that is available for free online is linked here. I Am AI is currently being sold as an ebook for $2.99, and many of the Chinese-language stories are translated in the anthology *Adventures in Space: New Short stories by Chinese & English Science Fiction Writers*. We expect but cannot guarantee that these will be provided to Hugo voters in the Hugo Voter Packet. Non-voters who wish to participate in discussions should explore options to buy or borrow the relevant books. 
- One story, ""Tasting the Future Delicacy Three Times"" by Baoshu, does not appear to currently have an English translation. We hope but cannot guarantee that it will be translated before our scheduled discussion on June 27. If not, our lack of Chinese speakers will limit our ability to discuss that particular story. 
- Because the Short Fiction Book Club organizers are also Hugo Readalong organizers, Short Fiction Book Club will be on hiatus for the months of April, May, June, and July. We will still post our monthly discussion thread on the last Wednesday of every month, but the short fiction discussions in the Hugo Readalong will take the place of our regular SFBC meetings.",Fantasy

1712228358.0,Question about R.A. Salvatore's Corona world?,"I am approaching the halfway mark of his newest trilogies 3rd book. I loved the DemonWar novels when I was a kid. I recently listened on audio for the first time. Now, for those who know the series intimately as I do, others this could get spoiled. Aydrian has just now returned to Ursal. To privately meet with Midalis. In the original DemonWars Midalis was a brother to the King. In this book he's stated as a nephew to Danube.

1712227229.0,Does anyone feel Dungeon Crawler Carl get a little too convoluted?,"I enjoy the series, on book 5 right now, but all the game mechanics and story lines got kind of hard to follow for me. Might be because I only listen to the audiobook, might be because I'm actually stupid, but I'm kind of lost on what the characters are doing half of the time, like >!What Carl was trying to do to save all the crawlers in the subway level, what they were trying to do with the flooding at the end of level 5, what The Gate of the Feral Gods actually does, and what's the deal with the doll head Samantha.!<

Anyone else feel the same way? Should I switch to reading text?

Edit: format",Fantasy
1712226600.0,Book/series similar to the longest journey game (1999),"So I knowww this sub has other people aware of this game’s existence lol. I know it was big when it came out too, I just happened to be a toddler at the time.

Anyway, this point and click game covered a young woman living in a world that takes place in our future. It had interesting dystopian sci fi elements, and she ends up being able to travel from that to a fantasy world. I love how witty she was, and that the story is essentially split between two complex worlds and how they’d interact with each other. I love how quick she was to adapt to the fantasy land. 

 I love portal fantasy, if it wasn’t clear! Any books like this, I’ll love you forever thank you ",Fantasy

1712226078.0,Best fantasy novel/magic system 2023(little late I know),"Hey guys. I’m kinda low on reading recommendations and I wanted to ask you about it. Like the title says, what is, in your opinion, the best fantasy novel of 2023, with the addendum of the best magic system? I’m a little late, but I’m saying 2023 because 1) I just read The book that wouldn’t burn by Mark Lawrence, published in 2023(so goood!!!) and 2) Because if you’re going to recommend trilogies, which I know you will, maybe having the second book closer will make the wait more bearable.

So, what are your top picks?",Fantasy
1712225789.0,Trying to choose the next fantasy world,"Hello there! Trying to make this short:
I am currently contemplating between The Kingkiller Chronicles, The Stormlight Archives and The Wheel of Time. Obviously you can’t compare them directly and the lengths of the series vary a lot but nevertheless they interest me. 
Apart from Tolkiens Middle Earth I really loved The Lies of Locke Lamorra (primarily the first book) with all the heists and plot twists and whatnot.

What would you recommend me? Any of the ones I mentioned above or another series? I would prefer a series but it’s no necessity. I am very grateful for your recommendations :)

1712218286.0,The Faithful and the Fallen missing from Audible in the UK,"Hi there everyone. Has anybody else noticed that The Faithful and the Fallen has been removed from the UK Audible store? There's a message saying it isn't available in this region at the moment. It's a real shame as I listened to Malice and Valour and took a break for a few months hoping to finish the series and now they've been delisted. Oddly, they're available in Spanish and German but not English.

Has anything been posted online anywhere about why this might be? I've done a lot of digging and found nothing.

1712195830.0,What are the best found family fantasy books?,"Objectively or subjectively, what are the best character driven, emotional, found families in the epic fantasy genre. I think lotr is an obvious one that I have yet to read, although I loved the movies, I typically don’t read books after I’ve seen the movie but it could be an exception. I heard jade city is pretty good? It’s a pretty recent booktok book. My favorite found family books are six of crows and the poppy war.

Mistborn is also a popular one, I read it and it was great but I didn’t obsess over their found family because vin was the only girl, and all the men were older than her. As a teenage girl I couldn’t appreciate as much as I’d like to. I mean this to say I like when the found family is a younger generation.",Fantasy

1712205014.0,Books that end with nature taking over a place of suffering,"I saw this comment on a YouTube video about the train stations in Germany used to send holocaust victims to concentration camps being overgrown with nature as a symbol that the trains would never leave again.

I’m looking for a book or series that ends with (or prominently features) a similar theme. Of the futility of humans and everything people do to make others suffer, when compared to the grand scale of nature and plants and everything else. That everything in the book so far and all the horror we read about doesn’t matter in the long run. Preferably with a sense of pain and beauty in the end. Horrible things have happened but nature will always live on. 

I know this is vague but anything like that would be great. I really just want that gut punch feeling at the end (in an epilogue maybe?). 

I know this is kind of asking to spoil endings so it’s fine if you only give me a title, and you can be sparse with details! Or hide bigger spoilers if you think it’s necessary to make your point. But I’ll probably read whatever book is suggested since I doubt there’ll be many suggestions that don’t fit the prompt anyway.

Thanks!",Fantasy

What are some of the more obscure dragon books that you've come across and enjoyed? I've recently tried reading fourth wing by Rebecca yarros and unfortunately DNF it.

1712194098.0,Your favorite group names and job titles in fantasy books?,"What are some of the super cool/super fitting titles or organization names you've seen in books? Why did you like them? I only have a few examples from recent things I've read because I can't think of a lot of them, but that's why I want to hear it from you!

* The Steel Inquisitors from Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson: really emphasizes how ominous these creepy guys are
* Once-born, twice-born, and thrice-born from the Burning Kingdoms, Tasha Suri: these were the titles for members of a mysterious and feared religious order. They're simple, but I felt they set the right tone.

Edit: said Steel Watchers instead of Steel Inquisitors, sorry, Baldur's Gate brain",Fantasy
1712192836.0,Fantasy Readers should read The Corn Queen and the Spring Queen by Naomi Mitchison,"Okay, so, first things first, *The Corn King and The Spring Queen* is not fantasy and it is not an easy read.  It is long and complex, and it is stuffed with layers and thoughts and heart and heartbreak.  It's an epic historical novel *with magic*.  It's feminist literature (think Virginia Woolf) of a very high standard.  It's a parable of a world at war (originally published in 1930) where the poetic notions of freedom are capriciously at the mercy of greedy, flawed and wealthy men.  

Naomi Mitchison was a friend to J.R.R. Tolkien.  She proofread The Lord of the Rings and you can read some of their letters back and forth online.  She championed the book when it was first published and before many people recognized how wonderful of an accomplishment it truly was.  

More than that, though, she was a kick ass writer (and woman) in her own right.  I mean, shit, she helped to found birth control centers in London 100 years ago.  

This is blurb I found online.  

> Erif Der, a young witch, is compelled by her father to marry his  powerful rival, Tarrik the Corn King, so becoming the Spring Queen.  Forced by her father, she uses her magic spells to try and break  Tarrik's power. But one night Tarrik rescues Sphaeros, an Hellenic  philosopher, from a shipwreck. Sphaeros in turn rescues Tarrik from near  death and so breaks the enchantment that has bound him. And so begins  for Tarrik a Quest--a fabulous voyage of discovery which will bring him  new knowledge and which will reunite him with his beautiful Spring  Queen. 

This intro covers, maybe, the first 1/6th of the book, as the book takes place in two locations.  You'll be reading in the first location (Marob - a stand in for Scotland) for a long while, but then everything shifts to Greece and then, as they say, *shit gets real.*   

Let me tell you that Philylla's scene is as epic and moving and inspirational as any just about any scene that you will read in any book.  You will know the scene that I mean when you read it.  Strength as love.  Love as sacrifice.  Sacrifice as strength.",Fantasy
1712191136.0,Books like “The Arrow” or King’s Dark Tidings,"Extremely minor spoilers of the description of the MCs personality in KDT:

>!I love how Rezkin is a mix of kind and ruthless, and he has to reconcile the brutal things he does that are necessary with dealing with his friends who don’t have the stomach for certain things.!<


It reminded me of the Arrow upon rewatching how Oliver gets things done and then humor arises from him trying to explain some harsh thing he did to people who are more squeamish than him.

Arrow Spoilers
>!I specifically love how Oliver’s past is slowly revealed and people who assume he is gonna be a no one rich kid are very surprised, bonus if it’s a vigilante or secret identity, and also bonus if the formula is like arrow where background is show in flashbacks alongside current story!< Infinite Realms does this but without the gone and came back stronger sequence.

I really like authors who skirt the line of ‘not a psychopath’ but also people who won’t hesitate to defend themselves, like I’m fine with people being upset after but dwelling forever on the death of someone who was trying to kill you annoys me.

No harems
Preferably male lead
Preferably not slice of life
Preferably little to no typos and grammar errors.

I just finished belladonna & foxglove (planning to read wisteria when it comes out) and I thought they were great! On the YA side, but I didn’t mind. I loved that they were fantasy/romance, yet also murder mystery (as that’s what I typically go for). The magic & fantasy worlds draw me in, but the mystery & suspense is really what keeps me reading. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for fantasy novels that have a lot of suspense or some sort of mystery involved? Or just any series that really kept you hooked the whole way through?  I’m not too picky other than I don’t care for MMCs!

1712185246.0,Urban Fantasy with a struggling adult FMC?,"I'm currently shopping for new books of my favorite genre and I'm finding it somewhat difficult to find something that speaks to me.

I don't want another female main character that is supposed to be grown but acts like a 13y/o, gives off ""not like the other girls"" energy, or is supposed to be sassy and witty but actually comes off rather mean in reality!

Instead, I'd love to read something with a female lead who perhaps is struggling to get a grip of her powers, or maybe has only weak powers to begin with, who might have social anxiety, or constantly overshares, who is clearly the least favorite child of their parents, struggles to make ends meet,...

I'm not at all opposed to romance but I'd really like there to be fleshed-out platonic relationships as well.

""My Roommate is a Vampire"" by Jenna Levine

1712181813.0,Books or series with 40+ year old women protagonists on an adventure like Ista (Paladin of Souls) or Amina (The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi)?,"With both of those books I felt myself so drawn to the protagonists. They were super appealing to me. Similarly I loved reading The Broken Earth trilogy in no small part because of Essun as a character. Something about a well written middle aged woman going on an adventure in a fantasy setting really gets me excited for the story. Any recommendations for other books or series to try? I'd also be glad of recommendations with older women as protagonists.

Edit: thank you all so much! You've gotten me excited about a wonderful array of books. I've tried to keep up and respond to most of your comments but I won't be able to answer all of you. So I just wanted to say a really big thank you. And keep the recommendations coming :)",Fantasy

I like multiple POV books but I don't like characters that were in the first books to be added later for a POV unless they were too young like Frentis being added as POV was great. Lyrna was just a bland character I couldn't like it hate which made me dread reading her chapters.

1712156552.0,Mature Fantasy Recommendations,"Hi All,

Hoping to get some book recommendations and am looking from a reasonably specific perspective so wanted to explain it.

I'm really into Fantasy/Sci-Fi, talking ASOIAF, The First Law, Brando Sando, Leviathan Wakes, The Locked Tomb, Imperial Radch. All the good stuff.

However, I have recently read a few more romance-style books, particularly the Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea. I feel like I've avoided this genre in the past, mainly due to my own 'Not Like Other Girls' snobbery, but I do enjoy it, and would like to find some books to look into the genre more.

The new Goodreads Romantasy category would be a good place to start, if I trusted the Goodreads Choice Awards one iota. But I don't. I'm not really looking for anything too cringey, I don't like miscommunication tropes or female leads with no personality. Not looking for Smut though I wouldn't be entirely put off by NSFW content. I'd like some good old fashioned sexual tension alongisde an interesting magic system, good plot etc. Open to any gender combinations too.

Would really appreciate your help!",Fantasy

Hello r/Fantasy! I’m here with some more punny antics to share with all of you! When I put my writing out on the wider internet last year, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it was received by the reading community. Thank you to the mods for letting me share with you, and everyone who read book 1! I may or may not have some screenshots of me sitting next to some of my favourite authors on the best seller lists. It seems people are *thirsty* for more, so I’m pleased to present another book for your reading pleasure.

A Brewtiful Life - Beers and Beards Book 2 is now out on Amazon in ebook, physical, and audio format!

**Description:**

Peter Roughtuff now has a home, a brewery, and enough gold in the bank to finally relax.

With the events of last year behind him, he can get down to what really matters – brewing. When he’s not fending off horrors like tax auditors, belligerent goats, or gnomish corporate ninjas, that is!

Join Pete and the rest of the Thirsty Goat family as they throw themselves into preparations to win the biggest contest of their lives. With the future of the True Brew, and a bet with the God Barck on the line, Pete is going to do whatever it takes to become the best brewer in all of Minnova!

Book 2 of a Cozy Fantasy LITRPG Series filled with love, laughter, epic fantasy, and a little melancholy. *Beers & Beards* balances epic fantasy & slice-of-life with charm aplenty and a charisma score high enough to make a bard blush. It doesn't matter if you like beer or not, this is set to fill your need for comforting stories!

Edit: excellent show. It has some nonsense and is definitely for children, but if you liked the book, it's a fun show to have on in the background while you're doing chores or something. If you have any 6-12 YO kids lying around somewhere, I suggest that you watch it together and make an afternoon of it.

1712141377.0,"13 mini-reviews: Druid's Oak Farm, Scavengers, Guardian of Aster Fall, Mark of the Fool, Ends of Magic, Hunting and Herbalism, etc","## [Ravenwood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13064622-ravenwood) by Nathan Lowell

**Blurb**

>You're never too old to make a bad decision. After twenty winters on the road, Tanyth Fairport makes one last pilgrimage in her quest to learn all she can about the herbs and medicinal plants of Korlay before settling down to write her magnum opus. Her journey is interrupted when she decides to help a small village and learns that much of what she knows of the world may not be quite as it seems. Nathan Lowell blends wiccan tradition and shamanistic lore into a fantasy quest for a new - if unlikely - heroine. She learns that the familiar sometimes hides the fantastic and that, even when you think you’ve made your decisions, life doesn’t always agree.

**Review**

I liked this for the most part. A hamlet thankful for Tanyth to replace their old healer and then having to fend off unwanted guests. Tanyth staying at one spot for months after decades of travel. And a bit of magic. The pacing was steady, with a bit of action mixed with slice-of-life scenes. I would've preferred if the story had focused more on the inn.

## [Druid's Oak Farm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/143424506-druid-s-oak-farm) by Susanna Scott

**Blurb**

>When Maeve McQuaid loses her boyfriend and her gardening job in one fell swoop, fate intervenes in the shape of Beth, an elderly lady carrying a gap-year-size backpack. She turns out to be the owner of the mysterious Druid's Oak Farm in North Yorkshire and offers her a job. The farm is an artist's community which has become tired and run down, much like its inhabitants. The Elizabethan building needs to be saved but Beth is slowly going bankrupt. Can Maeve make a formal garden from an overgrown shambles? Can her enthusiasm lift everyone out of their lethargy or will they rise up against her ideas?

**Review**

This was a short and sweet cozy novel, with a bit of magical realism thrown in. Characters (including the dog) were the main highlight, even though we didn't get much in terms of depth given the short nature of the book. Writing was easy to follow, though descriptions got a bit tedious to focus on.

The main plot was about saving the retreat (for artists and the like). Among other things, we got interesting anecdotes about druids mixed with historical events. And some romantic sub-plots too. Overall, a pleasing comfort read.

## [Sweet Bean Paste](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33376821-sweet-bean-paste) by Durian Sukegawa, Alison Watts (Translator)

**Blurb**

>Sentaro has failed. He has a criminal record, drinks too much, and his dream of becoming a writer is just a distant memory. With only the blossoming of the cherry trees to mark the passing of time, he spends his days in a tiny confectionery shop selling dorayaki, a type of pancake filled with sweet bean paste. But everything is about to change.

**Review**

This was a mix of cozy and uncomfortable things. I wasn't sure if I liked the book, but I found myself turning the pages nonetheless. It did end with a poignant message, and I think it's good to read such stuff now and then.

## [A Fellowship of Bakers & Magic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/195213451-a-fellowship-of-bakers-magic) by J. Penner

**Blurb**

>A human, a dwarf and an elf walk into a bake-off… In the heart of Adenashire, where elfish enchantments and dwarven delights rule, Arleta Starstone, a human confectionist works twice as hard perfecting her unique blend of baking and apothecary herbs. So when an orc neighbor secretly enters her creations into the prestigious Elven Baking Battle, Arleta faces a dilemma.

**Review**

This had plenty of cozy moments but also lot of drama and emotional content that it wasn't a fully comfort read that I was hoping for. I especially liked the characters and some of the worldbuilding elements.

## [Crazy Foolish Robots](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59118352-crazy-foolish-robots) by Adeena Mignogna

**Blurb**

>Ruby Palmer finds herself on an entire planet surrounded by the things she hates the most: robots. Besides taking everything she says way too literally, the robots have problems of their own. A myriad of technical glitches are, on the cosmological scale, quickly destroying them. Ruby has the programming knowledge and skills that matter to them, but can she overcome her fears and find it within herself to help? Her survival, along with the survival of all of humanity and robot kind, depends on it.

**Review**

Nice sci-fi novella that was just what I needed to get a break from reading too many progression fantasy books. The tone was light with humor shining here and there. The pacing was good enough that you'd not feel bored. The plot was okayish, though that's a little tougher to comment on given that it is part of a series.

## [Scavengers (Quest Academy #2)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203274611-scavengers) by Brian J. Nordon

**Blurb**

>Change is coming to Quest Academy. Can Sal rise to the occasion? When the second years nearly lose their lives in a failed excursion, it’s the first years that pay the price. The curriculum is being radically altered to challenge the students, which means the stakes just got a lot higher.

**Review**

This was another amazing book that focused on crafting and slice-of-life scenes. There were action scenes too, especially at the end. The introduction of new side-characters were nicely done. I wish it hadn't come at the cost of reducing Divinity and Barry's interaction with Sal (a few chapters from their POV would've been welcome). Speaking of Sal, it was cool to see so many small details that improved his capability - very excited to see them fully realized in later books. Not getting to meet Analysis professor after all the hype at the end of the first book was another tiny bit of disappointment, but hope the next book would cover it.

## [Tree of Aeons 4](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199301222-tree-of-aeons-4) by spaizzzer

**Blurb**

>Aeon attempts to find the origins of the demons, and ventures into the other realms through the void sea. Join Aeon and the Order as he builds an institution able to protect their own worlds, and take the fight back to the demon controlled worlds.

**Review**

Took me a few chapters to get used to the setting (and the summary type chapters that cover roughly a span of one year). I keep wishing there was lot more depth to the characters and events that happen, but given the time scale that'd blow up the already long books.

Anyway, what I enjoy most is all the magical crafting/progression that Aeon organizes to deal with demons and other political problems. A few scenes that allowed us to see through side-characters POV were nice to have (I'd prefer a lot more of these). The ending was cool, would be interesting to see how the new powers/locations shape up in the next book.

## [Guardian of Aster Fall](https://www.goodreads.com/series/327986-guardian-of-aster-fall) by David North

**Blurb**

>Across the world of Aster Fall, there are unique classes, but not all of them can be trained. They require quests and accomplishments that simply don't exist in the world. Some say the World Law itself is broken and that the world is falling apart. In comes Sam Hastern. His family has been cursed by one of these classes for the last fifty years. No one has ever managed to level it, condemning them to the lowest paying jobs and life in a barren village. The class is called Battlefield Reclaimer. There's one more little problem. Sam's about to have it even worse, when a dungeon exploration leaves him looking distinctly non-human.

**Review**

One of the rare fantasy novels where the main character's family was alive and well. And even better, they were a lovely family who support each other. To top it all, father and son go on an adventure and do awesome stuff together! And the remaining family members also gain in power in the sequels.

The plot, magic system and worldbuilding didn't feel anything special in the first book — those became much more interesting in the sequels. The writing was good enough to keep me interested and some of the action scenes were done very well. I got a bit of action fatigue in the first two books, which again improved in the later books. I especially enjoyed the crafting stuff.

Many of the side-characters were interesting as well, so much so that I wished them to be featured lot more than we got. For example, there were two dwarf locations (and related characters), bloodline clans, etc but hardly any depth to them.

I had many minor complaints like long stat sheets, repetitive descriptions, etc. All said and done, I read the 6 books in less than 10 days. The series was definitely binge worthy.

## [Mark of the Fool 6](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199340499-mark-of-the-fool-6) by J.M. Clarke

**Blurb**

>To preserve the future, Alex must find the secrets of the past. After a devastating battle, Alex Roth is left with more questions than answers, and—as the Ravener grows more aggressive—he and his companions struggle to learn the truth of Thameland’s Cycle. But—thanks to an old enemy—they do have one lead, though it will take them into the bowels of the darkest Hells.

**Review**

Some of the secrets between the heroes finally came out in the open. The first half was mostly slice-of-life, crafting, talking, preparations, etc. As much as I enjoy these kinda chapters (I even wanted a few of these chapters to have been longer), I wish the pacing had been a bit faster.

The second half was better, but I only really got excited with the action scenes at the end. Plus, many revelations to secrets that had been building since the first book. I was totally caught by surprise by one particular development, which seemed obvious in hindsight. Very much looking forward to how this develops in the coming books.

## [Adventurer (Ends of Magic #2)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199424276-adventurer) by Alexander Olson

**Blurb**

>The magical world of Davrar is inhospitable and strange. Terrible monsters roam, ancient dungeons lurk over every hill, and the prophesied Endings promise doom. But it’s Nathan Lark’s new home. He’s developed his antimagic and found friends in the most powerful Adventurers of his generation. They’ve sworn an oath to defend the city of Gemore and defeat the Endings. On the horizon is the enslaving mage-empire of Giantsrest, and Archmage Taeol dho Droxol hasn’t forgotten that Nathan holds secrets of Earth. Conflict is certain. There is only one path forward. Nathan and his friends must advance.

**Review**

Wow, what an ending. Events escalated lot more than what I was expecting based on the first half of this book. Wonder if the next book is going to be consistent high octane action — I wouldn't mind that, but I also enjoyed the relatively slower paced chapters in this book (Nathan and the heirs leveling up, discussing their options, Insights discussion, going around Gemore on scouting missions, etc). It was nice to have the team stay together almost for the entire book — wish the heirs had some POV scenes.

I was also hoping for some significant interaction between Nathan and the crafting experts in this book, but we got only a scene — though that was really significant and I can guess how that'll be necessary given the direction of the plot.

Overall, I enjoyed this book better than the first one.

## [Hunting and Herbalism](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68386/hunting-and-herbalism) by Synonymoose

**Blurb**

>Unbeknownst to her, Zalia is brought to the snowy north of another world containing magic, classes and levels. A world where elementals are stirring, mysterious rituals are appearing and a war wages. Read through as Zalia deals with beasts and myths on her path to survive and explore harsh environs, maybe even ranking up along the way. A hunter and herbalist, she has the tools needed to survive and thrive in a new world of magic and danger.

**Review**

What I liked most was the main character being a Druid, with a cool set of powers that developed well as she leveled up. The opening few chapters had the standard tropes of a human from Earth being isekai-ed to a fantasy world. After the short survival phase, it was great to see goblin-like creatures actually helping out the main character instead of being a fodder for leveling up. Their culture was intriguing too.

The main plot that followed was yet another war-type situation that the MC had to help resolve. Many of the side-characters were memorable and it was nice to see them having their own aspirations and stuff. I love books with beast bonds and the one we got in this series was amazing! The first book was almost cozy at times — until events started going haywire as the climax phase started. Some of the developments were darker than I was comfortable with.

And it ended on a cliffhanger! So of course, I *had* to continue with the second book. This one was the best among the first three books, which sort of completes an arc. The worldbuilding was cool, the survival-type plot and power-ups felt organic and well thought out. The writing improved as the series progressed.

I binge read the three books and the interlude chapters in about 5 days. Not surprising that this series was picked up by a publisher and I hope that'd make these books even more polished.

## [Imperial Wizard](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193467985-imperial-wizard) by J. Parsons

**Blurb**

>Verdan Blacke is an Imperial Wizard, a researcher by preference but soldier by necessity. Surviving an intense battle, Verdan is cursed by a hex witch in her final moments. Without any good options, Verdan escapes the ever-increasing pain the curse inflicts by performing a self-made stasis ritual. When the spell fades, and he has awoken, Verdan finds a world completely different from the one he left behind. Dark things work in daylight with impunity, once common knowledge is a mystery, and even the nature of magic that humans use has changed.

**Review**

The story didn't take more than a few paragraphs to get going and the pacing remained good throughout the book. After the initial conflict that set the tone, I was excited by the prospect of main character's preference for magical research, alchemy, etc. Sadly, the events that followed allowed little time for such leisurely pursuits. Many of the side-characters were interesting and thankfully were given POV scenes as well. The progression aspect was much lighter than I was hoping for. The different types of magic users was an interesting twist to read.

In the second book, it was good to see some cool enchanting items being worked on. Looking forward to the mystery item that's not yet decoded fully, as well as the ruins being explored. The ending was darker than I was expecting, though it does puts the danger represented by the sects in perspective.

## [The Gorgon Incident and Other Stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202081126-the-gorgon-incident-and-other-stories) by John Bierce

**Blurb**

>In these twenty-four short stories set in the world of Mage Errant, John Bierce explores the murky depths of history, forgotten corners of Ithos and beyond, and the strangest reaches of magic itself.

**Review**

Mage Errant is one of my favorite magical academy books and this collection of short stories was a great addition to this amazing setting. We got to meet several side characters from the main series, as well as past stories, origin of named weapons, visit other continents, etc. Some of my favorites include:

* The Wanderer
* Test of Magic
* Old Setah and the River (wouldn't mind a novella/novel with Setah as the MC)
* Counterfeit
* The Gorgon Incident
* Mudflat Nights (mostly for the worldbuilding and pepper vs glass matchup)
* Luthe of Clan Castis

1712140472.0,What fantasy stories aimed at children hold up the best to adult audiences?,"It's often said that the mark of a really good kids story is that it's stil enjoyable for older people. It shows a sort of universal appeal of the story that transcends things like age.

What do people think are the best cases of this in the fantasy genre?

And obvious example I'd put foreward is The Hobbit by Tolkien. It's a classic for a reason and I believe it would still be read today even if Lord of the Rings never released. 

To present another medium other than books, I'd point out the films by Studio Ghibli. Definetely made for kids but their artistry can be and is universally appreciated.

I want to know what other works people would say fit this archetype.",Fantasy
1712139718.0,"I’m looking for stories where the characters win at life, not just at war.","Like Samwise and Rosie.

 I’m hoping for a book or film  that drags the characters through hell, and at the end they get to live and thrive and love. Not within the restricted life of a Courtier or monarch, but free to play and have fun, with some gardening. Something beautiful and idyllic. Many books promise this, only for a sequel to have characters dusting off their old armour as they find their children gone and their homesteads burned. I’m not looking for romance particularly but adventure. Adventure with a happy ending.",Fantasy

1712125425.0,The Butcher of the Forest by Premee Mohamed - Novella Review,"&#x200B;

Originally published at - [sffinsiders.com](https://www.sffinsiders.com/home/review-the-butcher-of-the-forest-by-premee-mohamed)

&#x200B;

>***Nothing in the Elmever was as it seemed; and many things were imitations of what they wished to be. And if she forgot that, she would never leave this place.***

**Blurb:**

At the northern edge of a land ruled by a merciless foreign tyrant lies a wild, forbidden forest ruled by powerful magic.  


Veris Thorn—the only one to ever enter the forest and survive—is forced to go back inside to retrieve the tyrant's missing children. Inside await traps and trickery, ancient monsters, and hauntings of the past.  


One day is all Veris is afforded. One misstep will cost everything.

**Review:**

Since the turn of the year, ‘The Butcher of the Forest’ by Premee Mohamed was one of the most highly praised and talked about pieces of work that I kept hearing about. Needless to say, both the cover and the intriguing blurb made sure I added it to my TBR without any second guesses. And fortunately enough, I got the opportunity to read it in advance as a digital review copy, courtesy of NetGalley, and the publishers, Tor Books.

>***At some point, you took a step, and you were simply there, and you would not see the difference between it and the true woods, and you would never take another step that led you back home.***

Veris Thorn – pushing forty; sold vegetables, rabbits, and someone who read and wrote letters for the village. To a foreign eye, she was just another villager going about her daily life. But to the common folk of the village, she was the only person ever to have ventured into the north woods… and returned back alive.

The valley she called her home was prone to constant invasions; always had been. But the latest conqueror who had laid eyes on their humble abode was no ordinary man…

 

>**…*****the Tyrant, the man with a thousand names and a thousand cities under his bootheel, he who had for no perceptible reason settled here in their land after grinding it into the dust and stamping his name upon it, bringer of death, lord of war, slaughterer of millions.***

Speaking against the Tyrant, even the ill thought of his ruthless rule, was a violation that was punishable by the highest of orders. But as Veris would soon find out, even he had a weakness which every other man, or tyrant alike, seemed to have… family. Veris is hurriedly summoned to meet the Tyrant in person, who would ask her of a favor – to bring back his missing children, a boy and a girl, from the dreaded north woods under any circumstances, well and alive.

Veris has no other option but to accept the nigh on impossible task as the Tyrant leaves her with no choice – failure would mean death and destruction for the whole valley. Veris wastes no time gathering herself and beginning the journey, for she had done this before… once, under harrowing circumstances. She had promised herself of never venturing into those dark and mystical woods ever again. But it seems like fate had other plans…

>***Everyone in the village, everyone in the valley, even those several days’ ride from the north woods, knew not to go into them.***

Veris knows that if she has any hope, even a tiny sliver, of finding and bringing back the young siblings alive, she must hurry and not panic… for panic was the enemy. Nothing in those woods was fair, and that was how it worked. ***No different without than within.***

With precious help from her “tokens”, Veris sets out into the north woods… a place where the real world met with, and cascaded into something far more magical and deadly – the Elmever. There were rules to be followed once you had entered; ***vague as they were, but which should not be broken nonetheless.***

Time is running out for Veris and the children. Less than a day is short enough in itself, but to add to that the mysteries hiding in those woods… hunting you with every step, Veris must use all the experience from her previous and only ordeal to brave the Elmever, against all odds…

>***…from here, below and above them, the woods still stretched, brimming and burning with magic like an invisible fire. If you did not believe in magic, a day here would teach you to believe, like it or no. You were surrounded by it, and must guard yourself against it, this thing you did not believe in.***

**The good:**

* The writing is excellent! And although the vocabulary can get a tad bit difficult at times, the prose is really smooth and flows along beautifully.
* The character of Veris is really well-written, and her journey through the woods is not only memorable, but will stay with me for a good amount of time.
* The story is like a single, continuous fairy tale with no chapters and a dark undertone, infused with fantasy, horror, and mystery elements. It is set in an “older” time period where magic and witches are seemingly real, and guns are starting to newly emerge. I really loved it from page one, and enjoyed it throughout.
* The atmosphere within the woods is so well described! The magical, mystical nature of it all; the darkness which is right around every corner; and the fact that it all feels real, but is not! Honestly, it is so vividly and utterly well-written that it felt as if I was right alongside Veris in her every single step! The third person perspective does the trick incredibly well, must be said.

**The “not so” good:**

Seriously, I have no complaints whatsoever. It’s a damn near perfect novella in my honest opinion.

***Note:*** **There are mature themes present; not recommended for younger audiences.**

**The verdict:**

‘The Butcher of the Forest’ is quite a stunning, and equally dazzling entry into the world of novellas. Dark, richly atmospheric, and magical in more ways than one. Pretty much every aspect of the novella is executed to near perfection – be it the story, the main character, or the writing. I was invested right from the start, and the incredible prose kept me hooked and engrossed until the very end. I would certainly not hesitate one bit when deciding whether to grab it or not. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Fantasy
1712124699.0,I liked Benjamin Ashwood Want to Know More About A.C. Cobble's other works?,"It's hard to find good romance fantasy books targeted towards men.

I absolutely loved the romance in Benjamin ashwood.


I saw the Author has three other works -  
- Cartographer series(3 books)
- King's Ranger series(6 books)
- Wahrheit(3 books)


What I want to know is -  

- Do these books have Romance in them?
- Are these completed? If so do they have a Happy ending(I don't want to read tragic/bittersweet endings)
- Most important does it have any NTR elements? (FMC getting intimate with other men after Being with MC... Forced Assualt on the FMC by other men that kinda stuff)

1712123372.0,"Okay, let's see if this works. Seeking gay MALE fantasy without the misery and angst.","I'm going to drop some preface to this one before people try to argue me around to ""being okay with things on the no list"" because that's happened in the last two communities I've tried to hit up for recommendations.

I'm a bi male. I have to very, very carefully hide the bi part of me at work as it is not a safe environment to be out in. I do not, therefore, like to read about people who have to do the same. 

I have been sexually assaulted in the past. I managed to end it quickly and escape, but I don't find it to be fun or interesting to read about. 

---

This is not saying I'm against other dark themes. I like dark themes. I like desperate struggles. I like feeling like my characters have earned their good ending. But not THOSE dark themes.

---

So: what I'm trying to find. I want to see if there is, somewhere, a fantasy novel that has a gay MALE romance in it. Without it being illegal, or angsty, or miserable, or something they worry about. No threats of execution, no one shouting slurs, no chance of being arrested, no one sneering at it for being ""unnatural.""

 I want the romance to be treated as unremarkable by other characters as a straight romance would in your bog-standard fantasy novels. I'd love a good, old fashioned, ""party on a quest"" novel, which just happens to have main characters getting a gay, male, fantasy romance. 

If we can imagine worlds with dragons and gods and magic, we can sure as hell imagine a world with a little tolerance. 

And now because I'm slightly drunk, in an awful mood and very tired, I'm going to go to bed and see you all in the morning. Thank you to anyone who tries to help.

[edit] Holy shit. Uh. I... was not expecting this kind of response and I'm not gonna lie, it's got me a bit emotional. Just... damn, guys. Thank you.

1712116615.0,I feel bad because I'm failing at reading Wheel of Time,"I know the title sounds weird. My original plan was to read most of the big fantasy book series before I perish. Arriving at Wheel of Time, I have mixed feelings. Starting EotW I quickly grew on the world and RJ's writing style. Well, at least *part* of his style. The detailed depictions are something I really loved, also traveling around, getting a glimpse of the world. However, when reaching >!The Ways!<, things started to bog down for me. I didn't really click with the ending and hopped into TGH a few hours after I finished the first book. I'm now at page 150 and I'm really struggling.

Some people wrote ""well, that's when it really picks up pace"" but it wasn't until I actually opened the Dragonmount's chapter summary and directly compared it with the Malazan's summary when I noticed the *huge* difference in what is (not) going on. Basically every chapter can be summarized in one or two lines, while you would basically need a fresh flipchart for Malazan. I know, this direct comparisson is apples and lemons. But at the moment I have no idea how the middle part of the books would play out, because (at least according to Reddit), this seems to be where things start to **slow down** on the plot-end.

Also I really miss character-growth. Reviews are pretty mixed here, some say the women are great, others... not so much. I think the woman are, at that point, still challenging to read (maybe excluding Moiraine). I mean, I'm almost 1000 pages in and I still feel detached from the characters. Frankly, the only character that really piqued my interest so far was Elayne as she clearly stood out (at least to me).

I'm torn here, because the characters are a vital part to a good read for me. I'm hesitant to bring up another (unfair) comparison here, but looking over to Abercrombie, I was instantly sold to Logen and Glokta, even Jezal is **interesting**. And that's the keyword here. Characters are not required to be or become likeable, but so far they are missing distinctive features that make them stand out. Instead the flaws that are chosen (so far) make it even more so challenging.

I'm really not sure what to expect, especially in terms of the later books.

1712111519.0,Modern day Merry Shelley,"Now, whether you argue that Merry Shelley’s inspirational work “Frankenstein” is science fiction or fantasy, the question is how do you think she would have written Frankenstein if she were a modern day teenager(since she wrote her book at that age)?

1712109826.0,2024 Bingo Recommendations for Kids," Hey r/fantasy! For the third year I’m presenting options for those looking to do Bingo with kids and teens in their life (or who want to read YA or Middle Grade books for their own bingo). This project originated after I had some students ask about the bingo challenge I talked about in class; I teach middle and high school English, and setting reading goals is something we do four times each year. Bingo-related goals are pretty common for me fourth quarter. Since then I’ve started doing this list, which I share with students who express interest, but also to you all to look at or ignore at your convenience.

The books below are options I think are good recs for a variety of kids, with three per category. This list includes both Middle Grade and Young Adult, but leans more towards Middle Grade this year, since that’s been my curriculum focus recently. I’ll flag when I haven’t read a book and why I still recommend it.  

While some here will be familiar to folks, I really wanted to include books many here might not know, since oftentimes book recs for kids here tend to be from 15+ years ago. This doesn’t mean those recs are bad, but more that there tends to be a specific set of books this sub recommends for kids from their childhood, without any knowledge of the awesome books being published now!

**First in a Series**

[Wilderlore](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49087613-the-accidental-apprentice?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2lTgBF7MnO&rank=1): this is basically animal companions, the series! Kids love them, and it’s a staple in my 6th grade classroom. Really fun series.

[Scythe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28954189-scythe?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_6): this is my YA Dystopia of choice, and I think it does a really good job of leaning into YA tropes while making them work for the premise. Basically in order to avoid overpopulation in a world that has solved death, specific individuals have the job of being able to permanently kill folks. This book follows two students who are selected to train as Scythes. The later books have lots of fun things to say about how we view history through a tainted lens!

[Mage Errant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42267952-into-the-labyrinth?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_11): popular here, but one not widely recommended for kids. It’s a great magic school story, and perfect for kids who might like something a bit like a Marvel movie in level of substance and epic fight scenes.

**Alliterative Title**

[Eva Evergreen the Semi-Magical Witch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51285821-eva-evergreen-semi-magical-witch?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_9): Inspired by Kiki’s Delivery Service, this book is lighthearted and fun for someone looking for an enjoyable romp.

[A Wolf Called Wander](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41180667-a-wolf-called-wander?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=RzswPXRwK1&rank=1): This is a great little book that follows a wolf trying to find his place in the world. Its only speculative elements are that we’re inside a wolf’s head, but kids have loved it.

[The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100915.The_Lion_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_10)The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe: a classic of the fantasy genre, and many kids still enjoy it. I tend to find its a bit heavy handed, but the series undoubtedly has some magic to it.

**Under The Surface**

[Daughter of the Deep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57094644-daughter-of-the-deep?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=Eou00ouc46&rank=1): The newest Rick Riordan book! Or one of the newer ones. He publishes a lot. This one leaves behind his normal schtick of mythology, and I think he does a good job of maintaining his identity as a writer while doing something new. Most fantasy loving kids will adore this on author’s name alone.

[Gregor the Overlander](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262430.Gregor_the_Overlander?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=jcKMXUuHod&rank=1): A nostalgia childhood pick about a normal kid and his baby sister who fall into an underground world filled with oversized talking animals. Bat Riders, Chosen Ones, Prophecies, and Cockroaches abound. Great series, and Suzanne Collins was a wonderful writer even before Hunger Games

[Somewhere in the Deep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123431496-somewhere-in-the-deep?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_21): I have not read this book, but it’s recently published (Feb 2024) and I didn’t have other great recs for this.

**Criminals**

[Six of Crows](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23437156-six-of-crows?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=9x5xa8vUg0&rank=1)Six of Crows: Most here know this one, but it’s a gold standard for criminal fantasy in general, YA or not. A crew of six criminals breaks into the world’s most secure vault.  Kids now might know them from the Netflix show.

[Cosmoknights](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43419730-cosmoknights-vol-1?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=1VSWaWkKvV&rank=1): queer women fighting the space patriarchy with mechs! A wonderful set of graphic novels with a good balance of action, theme, and character development. Appeals to young and old alike, and gives a breadth of representation for queer women.

[Artemis Fowl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/249747.Artemis_Fowl?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=0wIdpe9dff&rank=1): Boy genius believes in fairies and kidnaps one to blackmail the culture for gold. Another pick from my childhood. It’s worth noting that the writing style (especially in the opening bits) have posed a challenge to students, and is harder than you likely remember it being.

**Dreams**

[Wynd](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51323332-wynd-book-one?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=PVupgKThSw&rank=1): Another great graphic novel! A pretty classic heroes journey setup of a kid who has to run quickly to avoid being captured as a monster.  

[The Nightmare Thief](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52658288-the-nightmare-thief?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=BGtZkgoE0Y&rank=2): another phenomenal horror book set in a small coastal town, following a girl who works in the family business of selling dreams. Things go wrong when she’s blackmailed into making nightmares for a mysterious woman though.

[Raven Cycle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17675462-the-raven-boys?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=qBoAWSyTW4&rank=1): Haven’t read it, but a 10th grader who could likely write this list better than me recommended it.  

**Entitled Animals**

[When You Trap a Tiger](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44901877-when-you-trap-a-tiger?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=1EwgUhQk6s&rank=1): a magical realism book pulling on Korean mythology, this one was pretty widely acclaimed in librarian circles.  

[Beetle and the Hollowbones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52765957-beetle-the-hollowbones?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=sNEeuzbb42&rank=1): A graphic novel that skews towards the younger end. Beetle is filled with fun characters and great illustrations. Just a fun story.

[Leviathan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6050678-leviathan?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=1Uwe8aozRk&rank=2): World War 1, but with mechs and genetically engineered whales. Solid trilogy for those who like alternate history, girls dressing as boys to sneak into the military, and snarky princes who improve over time.

**Bards**

[The Last Cuentista](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56817365-the-last-cuentista?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=LGNXcIxB7D&rank=1): a dystopia that bucks a lot of the trends of YA dystopias. Follows the last person who remembers earth after the spaceship captain she was in deep-sleep for takes over and changes the mission of the last humans to flee Earth. She is the holder of the memories of the older world.

[A Snake Falls to Earth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56036276-a-snake-falls-to-earth?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=3X8PrBanIe&rank=1): a Lipan girl tells stories using social media meets a snake-person who is trying to save his best friend. A great use of mythology to tell an interesting story that doesn’t draw on existing middle grade literature as a template to copy/paste off. Really wonderful book.

[Inkheart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28194.Inkheart?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=OMU2373KWA&rank=1): A girl discovers she can read characters out of books, which goes horribly wrong when she accidentally reads the villain of a fantasy book into her world. 

**Prologues and Epilogues**

[Sir Callie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60323939-sir-callie-and-the-champions-of-helston?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=BNZ1qdFYf7&rank=2): This series is wonderfully queer and features a nonbinary protagonist (fleetingly rare in fantasy, especially for kids). The story itself won’t push you too much, but it’s sweet and fun.

[Steelheart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17182126-steelheart?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=8Wjyz5MuZW&rank=1): Brandon Sanderson’s take on evil superheroes. Kids tend to love or hate this action packed series. Book 1 follows the main character’s quest for revenge on Steelheart, who totally isn’t Superman.

[Ranger's Apprentice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60400.The_Ruins_of_Gorlan?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=d5W8d245xT&rank=1): an addictive series from my childhood that relies on classic tropes, moody atmosphere, and sneaky/smart characters. It’s pretty formulaic, but a lot of fun. After the first two books, the supernatural elements vanish, and it’s a mundane world that sort of maps onto ours. Sassy ponies abound.

**Self-Published**

[The Journals of Evander Tailer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60630617-the-enchanter?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=rgOyk4f6tU&rank=11): This is one of my favorite magic school stories being published right now! A good balance of social commentary, cool magic (the main character leans into crafting/witchcraft instead of battle magic), and a wholesome gay romance on the side.

[Dreadnought](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30279514-dreadnought?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=CKDP91Mgt5&rank=1): One of the more read books for Superheros in 2023, it follows a trans-girl who magically transitions as she assumes the mantle of Dreadnaught (also totally not Superman). I think the stronger parts of the book are examining how her life changes after transitioning, with the superhero elements being a little more simple.

[Trapped in a Video Game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39192865-trapped-in-a-video-game-book-1?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=DLNPhLgMnq&rank=1): A kid gets trapped in a sci fi video game. A classic premise, written for middle schoolers.  

**Romantasy:** Nothing really that I could think of for middle school, but I’m sure others could provide some options.

[Cemetary Boys](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52339313-cemetery-boys?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=VXzXJyf03R&rank=1): my favorite paranormal romance where a brujo must solve the mystery of a murdered teen who is haunting him. Along the way they fall in love.

[So This is Ever After](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55545191-so-this-is-ever-after?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=wIsFITZdZK&rank=1): I’ll be honest. This book is *stupid*. In the best way possible. If you want a mindless fantasy romance, this is your pick. The Chosen One must marry before his birthday or fade into nothingness. So he tries to date his way through his adventuring party because the one he has a crush on totally couldn’t like him back.

[Graceling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3236307-graceling?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=OlX0ZPgx69&rank=1): My pick for kids who don’t like romance as much. This one has a good blend of action and romance, following a cutthroat enforcer whose magical gifts are used to terrorize the people by her uncle. Only she’s working night shifts with the rebellion trying to right all her uncle’s wrongs. This book has the scariest villain in fantasy I’ve read.

**Dark Academia:** Another tough one, since Academia tends to imply college or above. I did my best.

[Amari and the Night Brothers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53240817-amari-and-the-night-brothers?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=QS14I3IMD3&rank=1): A girl goes to magic school to hunt down clues for her missing brother only to find she is one of the most powerful mages in the world. This book seemed poised to take up the mantle of Harry Potter. I don’t think it quite hit that level of popularity, but the books are great.

[Charlie Bone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9475.Midnight_for_Charlie_Bone?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=eHUR49vO1k&rank=1): dark gothic school with a kid who can talk to portraits. This whole series feels like it was written in black and white. Can get creepy, but never quite enters horror.

[Schoolomance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50548197-a-deadly-education?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=CSI4gKeanX&rank=1): Is this YA? I think book 1 fits, but not so much the sequels. Regardless, the author has accepted nominations YA awards, so I don’t feel too bad putting it here. If it is adult, teens will be fine reading it. Imagine a magic school where everything is trying to kill you: the students, the monsters, even the furniture. Oh and the main character is a warlock of doom destined to destroy the magical world as she knows it. And she’s grumpy, but ultimately a golden human being despite how much she glares at people.

**Multi-POV**

[The Magic Fish](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42394599-the-magic-fish?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=ZH68fmACuy&rank=1): Probably my favorite book on this list, and a true masterpiece. It weaves together stories of a young Vietnamese boy trying to come out to his mother, her history of immigrating to the US, and three fairy tales from different cultures. Beautiful art, beautiful story, and has enough thematic depth to stand up to rereads. One of the only books I’ve ever used as a whole-class read.

[Gearbreakers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54017833-gearbreakers?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=pQzBTz9tqN&rank=1): sapphic action dystopia with mechs and romance! Enough said.

[Theo Tan and the Fox Spirt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53826568-theo-tan-and-the-fox-spirit?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=pOeYTpce5Y&rank=1): So much great middle grade fantasy has been coming out recently, and this one was a joy. This book blends classic fantasy action, Chinese mythology elements, and dealing with grief.

**Published in 2024:** I have read none of these, but I desperately want to soon.

[Kindling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/173956619-kindling?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=Nkpe0v2Cgy&rank=2): What happens to child soldiers after they’re no longer needed?

[Curse of Eelgrass Bog](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129302917-the-curse-of-eelgrass-bog?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=jfgH2KwA0z&rank=1): seems like a very vibe-y supernatural mystery book that leaves the action packed fantasy behind for something more thematic.

[A Tempest of Tea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59406549-a-tempest-of-tea?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=N7Q603dsNx&rank=1): I know precious little about this book other than that vampires are involved and the cover is insanely good.

**Disability**

[Magesterium](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20578940-the-iron-trial?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=BPHqKs76Lz&rank=1): Cal desperately wants to flunk out of magic school to make his dad proud. Very Harry Potter inspired, with a good take on the chosen one trope. MC walks with a limp.

[The Spirit Bares its Teeth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89144437-the-spirit-bares-its-teeth?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=Nil5yj0Drl&rank=1): an autistic trans man is put in a correctional boarding school for misbehaving spirit-interacting women. A pretty dark book (thematically and also a lot of body horror) but very well written and with research to back up how women and people with disabilities were tried to be ‘healed’ in horribly cruel ways.

[One For All](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51238708-one-for-all?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=T9du4Ayfib&rank=1): I have not read this book, but I wanted a non-limp physical disability (there were surprisingly many of those). It’s a feminist take on the three musketeers with a lead who has chronic illness.  

**Published in the 90s**

[Dealing with Dragons](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150739.Dealing_with_Dragons?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=P4VnkC2D9I&rank=1): Inspired by fairy tales, this book has a pretty typical 90s take on feminism, but is a lot of fun to read and has a good sense of humor.

[Dragon Rider](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/100464.Dragon_Rider?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=ZRDqIdjSSj&rank=1): A wonderful adventure with fantasy critters across a world. This book was a part of my childhood and I’m enthused to recommend it here.

[Wild Magic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13836.Wild_Magic?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=UcTNLidipZ&rank=1): Tamora Pierce is awesome, and this was my first ever audiobook! Daine can talk to animals, but is terrified of her powers. She joins on as an apprentice to a housemistress and is thrust into a world of acceptance she’s not ready for. But her fear of what she can do is confronted by the growing need to master her skills. If you can listen to it, the fullcast audio production is phenomenal.

**Orcs, Trolls, and Goblins oh My!**

[Fablehaven](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44652.Fablehaven?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=1gy7pjv79G&rank=1): a pair of siblings stay with their grandparents and discover they run a nature preserve for magical creatures. A troll plays a decent role in book 1, but later books would not qualify.

[Tank and Fizz](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22946859-tank-fizz?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=cR5mtn9Igs&rank=1): a funny story about a goblin with enjoyable mysteries. Teens won’t enjoy it, but great for younger readers.

[The Princess and the Goblin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444381.The_Princess_and_the_Goblin?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=wk7SllDa0R&rank=1): Want to go back to the origins of fantasy novels? Look no further than George MacDonald! Great for kids who want to explore the history of the genre.

**Space Opera**

[Dragon Pearl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34966859-dragon-pearl?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=oyqbw5faRq&rank=1): a fox spirit goes on a search for her brother and ends up entangled in some interstellar conflicts. A wonderful blend of Korean mythology and science fiction elements.

[Cinder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36381037-cinder?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=K7WaXp9nz8&rank=1): a retelling of Cinderella with a cyborg main character. The Lunar Chronicles have been a staple in my classroom for a while, and the quality of their writing is high the whole way through. Significant romance elements for those for whom this matters.

[Skyward](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36642458-skyward?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=y492uVQMBi&rank=1): Perhaps too action-focused to be space opera (though book 2 almost certainly is). A young pilot in training fights against the legacy of her traitor father, deals with a snarky AI, and has to save humanity from an alien invasion as they hunker on their asteroid home.  

**Author of Color**

[Legendborn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50892338-legendborn?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=Jyc7bmogP3&rank=1): Arthurian mythology meets traditional Black spiritual beliefs with a big heaping of commentary on racism and the legacy of slavery in America. One of the best YA books of the last five years.

[Lei and the Fire Goddess](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59361636-lei-and-the-fire-goddess?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=LxZHnOZzIm&rank=1): Hawaiian mythology following the Percy Jackson mold. One of my preferred in the swamp of middle grade mythology books, and pretty recently published.

[Ghost Boys](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34647324-ghost-boys?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=hQxvBUlfGC&rank=1): a magical realism story that follows a black boy killed by police. It tells the events leading up to his death and what happens after he becomes a ghost, alternating between chapters to slowly unravel the story. A masterpiece.  

**Survival:**

[Frostheart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43805740-frostheart?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=Tb6FueIWVg&rank=1): a ship sails on an ocean of snow. It’s childish and fun, with a Sunday morning cartoon aesthetic, but quite well done. Fun illustrations too!

[Hunger Games](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=PtdV5ZNS8Z&rank=1): Suzanne Collins changed the game with this book, and Dystopia took off. Can a girl avoid dying in a reality TV deathmatch?  

[Leon and the Spitting Image](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/508517.Leon_and_the_Spitting_Image?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=s1kQt09CaE&rank=1): can a fifth grader survive a fifth grade teacher who will make class … SEW! … seriously though this book is insane and also wonderful and totally overlooked.  

**Judge a Book By Its Cover** (obviously subjective, but here are some of my picks)

[The Girl who Drank the Moon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28110852-the-girl-who-drank-the-moon?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=bnar4ZHdur&rank=1): One of my favorite covers ever, and also one of the best fairy tale vibe stories that isn’t a retelling of an actual fairy tale. The town sacrifices a baby to keep themselves safe from the witch. The witch is pissed that they keep leaving babies in the woods every year that she has to rehome.

[Professor Gargoyle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13414506-professor-gargoyle?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=9sfUT7x9dv&rank=1): an eldritch middle school filled with vaguely goofy mysteries. The cover of the book has that thing where the image changes based on where you’re looking at it from (one image is an old man, one is a demon with his features)

[Mamo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58673892-mamo?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=t09mIv0I0w&rank=1): is it any surprise that a graphic novel would have a great cover? Mama is a bit like Studio Ghibli got turned into a book. Vaguely witchy, great landscape shots, fun food. A really good story about what home means.

**Small Town:**

[Root Magic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53175322-root-magic?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=NRvAu3q3BL&rank=1): one of my favorite reads of the last few years because of how it bucks middle grade trends, Root Magic features competent adults, a historical setting where the history matters, and treating kids as able to handle serious situations. This book cannot be read enough in my book.

[Cece Rios](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49613673-cece-rios-and-the-desert-of-souls?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=erqraaKcWB&rank=1): a bruja must save her sister, and teams up with the spirit of Cyote to do so. This book does a great job blending mythology, serious topics, and a great story without needing to dip into corny humor to do so. And they only get better as the series goes on!

[This Poison Heart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860241-this-poison-heart?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=89uLg8v2PB&rank=1): in upstate New York, a girl with plant powers inherits a mansion filled with deadly poisonous plants, and a bunch of strangers who seem to know that the house holds important secrets.

**Short Stories**

(insert short story collection here) by their favorite author: Lots of popular authors will release a series of short stories in their universe. Rick Riordan, Tamora Pierce, Eon Colfer, etc. If the kid has a major hit series, there’s probably a book like this that goes along with it.

[Scary Stories for Young Foxes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40864887-scary-stories-for-young-foxes?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=mXJ7HLkmi9&rank=1): my favorite middle grade horror! It lands more on unsettling than horrific, and involves an elderly fox telling scary stories to kits. Content Warning for abusive parents.

[Other Ever AFters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59776461-other-ever-afters?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=PKNKeCK8k0&rank=1): This great graphic novel has a set of fairy tales reimagined from a queer and feminist lens. All are original stories, but they have the feeling of old school originals.  

**Eldritch Creatures**

[Pet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43568395-pet?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=jY5WcSi4Ht&rank=2): in world where ‘monsters’ have been eradicated to form a utopia, what happens when a young kid summons an eldritch abomination who says that a monster is living in the house of her best friend.

[The Supernaturalist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45432.The_Supernaturalist?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2xTE6yUFTs&rank=): a wonderful little sci fi dystopia book with strange creatures that few can see. The main character gets roped into an organization of kids that fights them, as they gather at sites of tragedy.

[Bartimaeus Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/124049088-the-amulet-of-samarkand?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=Pp2S1WNXiX&rank=2): an aspiring magician summons a sarcastic djinni to do his dirty work. This book has horrible covers, but some of the best character writing in kids fantasy. The footnotes are mandatory.

**Reference Materials:**

[Fart Quest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46223310-fart-quest?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=ZUlV99kKJP&rank=1): Its … it’s an adventure book for kids who like fart jokes. I don’t know what else to say about it.

[To Shape a Dragon's Breath](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61937038-to-shape-a-dragon-s-breath?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=jag7HqtKKZ&rank=1): a great story that tackles colonialism in America as a young native girl is forced to go to a dragon trainer academy, where her culture’s beliefs about dragons clash with the nordic society that has colonized America. Has more nuance and depth than I’m used to seeing in YA books, and that was a joy to see.

[Eragon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113436.Eragon?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=FxzK7StnHl&rank=1): Another oldie, but it remains a good book for teens ready to start transition into more adult epic fantasy. It isn’t perfect, but it doe the tropes really well.

**Book Club**

[The Darkness outside Us](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55200663-the-darkness-outside-us?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=5o7ErteoiY&rank=1): This gay space romance is very much YA (or potentially new adult) with some steamy scenes in it. Two spacefarers from not-NATO and not-Russia are supposedly on a rescue mission ... but something isn't quite right. It starts a bit slow, but when the plot and characterization hits, it hits hard. It ends up deep, philosophical, and existential despite being penned as a more simplistic romance. Great, great book.  

[The Hobbit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=IuFwc2nUyl&rank=1): Lots of kids these days haven’t read the classics (which is very much okay and not a bad thing. I will die on this hill). However, for some, this will be the perfect opportunity to explore some of the roots of the genre that they love now, and Book Club square is a great excuse to expand you horizons to the past!

[Sufficiently Advanced Magic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34403860-sufficiently-advanced-magic?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=lwkKfbAkDW&rank=1): This is another one of those books that I don’t think gets labeled as YA even though it almost certainly is. It’s a magical school story that feels very influenced by anime (to me at least), and will really enrapture students who are looking to get lost in a magic system.

1712108259.0,The Ceremony Trope,"I finally got around to reading Raymond Feist's Riftwar Saga; it's got it's 80s Fantasy vibe going on and I'm having fun with it. Early on, there's The Ceremony Trope where all the younguns are lined up to get their future careers and our chosen one is skipped over and he feels shame and at the end of the ceremony he actually gets the best job of all. And I've liked this trope since I first came across it in The Giver! I liked it in Cradle, it's the one thing I liked from The Divergent series, and I'm sure it's in many other places.

1712103625.0,Every SFF Book I Read in March 2024 Ranked,"Sorry, I'm a bit late with this, but here you go. 

If you saw my post for February, in which I read 10 books, you may click on this post and immediately wonder how I only read 5 books this month. First of all, I believe this is probably the average amount of books a person reads in a month. Also, there are a few reasons for this.

Reason #1: I had a much busier month

Reason #2: The longest book I read in February was approximately 375K words. In March, I read two longer books; 386K and 414K words respectively.

Reason #3: I dedicated a fairly large chunk of time to re-reading *The Way of Kings* by Brandon Sanderson to begin my *Stormlight Archive* re-read in anticipation of book 5. Because it was a re-read, I decided not to include it in the rankings (It would have been ranked #2 if I had).

Reason #4: I dedicated even more time to reading a book that I eventually DNFed. I decided to put it at #5 anyways, just so the number of books I read is correct anyways. Also, the book I have at #4 is not a book that I want to rank as the weakest of a month of reading (let's just say it was a real quality over quantity month).

So, without further ado, here is my ranking of the 5 SFF books I read this March.

&#x200B;

5)**River of Blue Fire** (*Otherland* \#2) by Tad Williams

Well, here you go. My first DNF of the year. This book was a huge disappointment for me, seeing as how I really enjoyed the first volume, *City of Golden Shadow*. I apologize to all the Tad Williams superfans who love this book (I plan to start *Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn* in April as a peace offering to you guys), I just couldn't keep going after 400 pages of nothing. Sure, the worldbuilding was fairly fun, but the most important element of a story is, believe it or not, a story. While the first book had a really engaging mystery to keep me engaged, this book's plot spun its wheels for the entirety of what I read. It was just characters going from place to place with no apparent end goal. It was dreadfully boring. Yes, there was a little bit of fun stuff, but it just wasn't enough.

&#x200B;

4)**A Clash of Kings** (*A Song of Ice and Fire* \#2) by George RR Martin

I read the first *ASOIAF* book all the way back in 2022. I loved it, but didn't pick up this second book until now. Usually, I read through a whole series pretty consistently and quickly, so why the long delay? Well, I've seen the TV series, so I felt like I knew all I needed to know concerning the story, and I was aware of its currently indefinite hiatus. I decided I'd wait until *The Winds of Winter* dropped to pick up the rest of the series. But after hearing so many people rave about the books (and realizing that Book 6 will probably *never* be released), I decided it was time to get going again. I don't think I realized how much I had missed these characters (well, not Bran and Sansa). Tyrion remains one of the greatest fantasy characters of all time. George RR Martin gets a lot of flak currently for his lack of writing progress, but he really is a masterful author. He writes some exhilarating scenes and knows how to make morality blurry. He really had me rooting for the *Lannisters* at some points in the book. Without a doubt, this was a five-star read. However, I do have to say that I prefer the second season of *Game of Thrones* to this book. The side characters are simply more fleshed-out, as are the storylines. For example, Robb's arc is barely even touched upon in the book while the show gives us all the details of his story. I'll digress, though, and simply enjoy this masterpiece for what it is.

&#x200B;

3) **A Storm of Swords** (*A Song of Ice and Fire* \#3) by George RR Martin

Here's another *ASOIAF* book, and it's the one that is generally regarded as the best. For the moment, I agree (I'm reading the next two in April). Not only that but it is also generally regarded as one of the greatest fantasy novels of all time. I can't help but agree. Even knowing what was coming for the entirety of the story, Martin's writing made every sequence and twist hit unbearably hard. One of the best lines in all of literature has got to be >!'Tywin Lannister did not, in fact, shit gold.'!< Tyrion's storyline was very strong, and sprinted across the finish line. His story is what kept the book going after that *huge* event in Catelyn's storyline. Every single Tyrion chapter in the final half of the book had at least one mind-blowing development. My heart kept consistently breaking throughout this story, even for Sansa. I would still contend that the show improves upon the book, but this book comes a lot closer to Seasons 3 & 4 than *A Clash of Kings* does to Season 2. One obvious place where the book has a leg up is in the epilogue. I simply cannot believe that they decided to leave that particular plot development out of the show! The thing I'm most excited for in the next two books is to see what Martin does with that storyline; I have no idea what's going to happen with it, and I couldn't be more thrilled. I hear that the show changed a lot from the next two books, and I can't wait to see the familiar mixed with the new (for me, at least).

&#x200B;

2)**Golden Son** (*Red Rising* \#2) by Pierce Brown

Would it be fair to say I'm fully addicted to *Red Rising* at this point? Yeah, I think it would. I zipped through this book at the tail end of the month, and it quite nearly took #1, something I didn't think was possible considering the book I have at #1. The first few chapters were a bit of a disappointment for me, since I hadn't been expecting Darrow to *still* be going through simulated warfare, but it picked right up and never took the foot off the gas. Is the dialogue completely unnatural? Sure, but that's my only bone to pick here. The pure exhilaration I felt from reading this novel can't really be put into words. The first book of this series was already a five-star book, but this one improved upon it in every conceivable way. The stakes were so much higher, the plot twists were astonishing, and the betrayals were even more unexpected. I can tell that Pierce Brown improved immensely as a writer between the publications of his first and second books. If this upward trajectory continues, I can't even imagine what the future of this series brings. *Red Rising*'s status as my favourite sci-fi series of all time has now been cemented, and *Golden Son* definitely surpasses *Dune* as my favourite individual sci-fi novel. I will absolutely be reading *Morning Star* in April, and might even get to *Iron Gold*.

&#x200B;

And my Book of the Month for February is...

&#x200B;

1)**Last Argument of Kings** (*The First Law* \#3) by Joe Abercrombie

Say one thing for *Last Argument of Kings*, say it's the greatest final book I have ever read. The only books I can put above this absolute thrill ride are those of *The Stormlight Archive*, and that's an unfinished series. Know how I was saying above that Tyrion Lannister is one of the greatest fantasy characters of all time? This book has three characters that match, if not surpass, him. Glokta, Logen, and Jezal are simply iconic. Their character arcs and voices are perfection. Glokta's internal monologue is so entertaining, and I've somehow come to trust this wicked torturer. All of Logen's character development was in the other two books, but that didn't make him any less compelling in this one; really, it just gave more time for the Bloody-Nine to emerge. And surpassing them both is Jezal dan Luthar, whose astonishing character arc propelled him from being a selfish jerk to being my favourite character in the series. This book also had a much stronger plot than the previous two. The action came fast and furious, with more savage brutality and impeccable writing than ever. It's not that I know all that much about medieval warfare, but Abercrombie's battles come off as some of the most realistic in the fantasy genre. The large-scale battles weren't the only stellar action sequences, though. This book contains one of the greatest duels ever put to the page. I was terrified for the character I knew and loved, and by the end of the sequence I was wide-eyed and breathless. Abercrombie can do that to a guy. Speaking of Abercrombie leaving me wide-eyed and breathless: THAT ENDING. WHAT THE HELL, JOE? I will certainly be back for more, and plan to read at least *Best Served Cold* and *The Heroes* in April.",Fantasy

1712097159.0,One Mike to Read them All: Advance review of “The West Passage” by Jared Pechaček,"This was extraordinarily bizarre, and very, very good.

When I started this, it was with an ebook ARC I got from the publisher. It was, I was sad to see, not illustrated, and it was painfully clear to me that I was missing a lot. So a big *thank you* to the people at Reactor/Tordotcom for answering my plea and getting me a physical ARC with the illustrations.

Speaking of illustrations: [here are some examples of the artwork](https://reactormag.com/excerpt-and-art-reveal-from-the-west-passage-jared-pechacek/), along with commentary by Pechaček on where he drew his inspiration from, and the text of the first chapter of the book. There is an illustration at the beginning of each chapter, almost a visual epigraph, depicting (very stylistically) a scene that takes place within that chapter. There is also a full-page illustration at the beginning of each book within *The West Passage*. Having tried to read it without those, the book is definitely missing something (sorry, audiobook readers).

The protagonists of this are Pell and Kew, two young inhabitants of Grey Tower thrust into positions of power and responsibility before they are ready. Grey Tower is part of “the palace,” which has no other name that is ever mentioned. It is a sprawling city, more than half decayed into ruin, dominated by the Grey, Yellow, Blue, Red, and Black Towers. The city is ruled by the Ladies, strange unknowable beings of wildly varying appearance and unclear but potent powers. As happens every few centuries, the Beast is rising to threaten the palace. Pell and Kew both, and separately, leave the familiar cloisters of the Grey, looking to reach the palace’s rulers in the Black Tower and get help.

Of course it is not so straightforward as that, and as Pell and Kew go off on their respective quests they travel far and wide over the breadth of the palace. They meet many very bizarre things; not only Ladies, but the many and varied inhabitants of the palace, before making their way back to Grey to confront the rising of the Beast.

The illustrations set the tone: Fantastical and mysterious, with a definite feeling of the medieval. It’s never entirely clear what is going on, or why. The strangeness of the palace is normal to Pell and Kew, and they don’t really feel the need to comment on it - it can take some time to figure out just how bizarre it all really is. Not a great book for those who like clear answers and explanations, because you’re basically going to get none. And, fair warning, this book has a lot of sadness in it.

I would call this “New Weird” if I had to pick a genre, but that doesn’t feel quite right. Possibly just because I associate with Jeff VanderMeer, and his stuff all has much more sinister/dangerous overtones than this book does. It also reminds me quite a lot of Walter Moers’ Zamonia books, though with more sinister/dangerous overtones than those books have. But slotting this into a genre just feels wrong, regardless. It’s too unique.

I think this is a love-it-or-hate-it book. I am giving it an easy 5 stars. But if someone were to say to me, “I read it, and WTF was that?” I would understand. Looking forward to hearing others’ opinions when it comes out this summer.

1712090784.0,Para's Proper Reviews: Failure to Communicate by Kaia Sønderby,"Space diplomacy is one of my absolute favourite subgenres of sci-fi, so even though reading consistently was still difficult for me when I started it, *Failure to Communicate* was a real treat. It reminded me of *The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet* crossed with *A Desolation Called Peace* and I could not put it down. Even if I have a few quibbles when it comes to the plot, the premise, readability, and the wonderfully well written autistic protagonist made it worthwhile.

Xandri is one of the best Xeno-Liaisons specialists in the Alliance. She is also one of the few autistic people (maybe the only one) born since humanity went hard on eugenics and eliminated it and other conditions through genetic manipulation. This time, she and her team are called in to help bring the Anmerilli people to the Alliance, to prevent a powerful weapon they just developed from falling into enemy hands. Before they even arrive, she stumbles upon a secret genocidal plot and the need for her to succeed is suddenly even higher than she expected.

Whenever I picked this book up, I could *not* put it down. I read the sample when it was on sale, bought it to continue, read a huge chunk in one sitting, and got the sequel and prequel before I was halfway through. Plucky spaceship crews of humans and aliens are my absolute catnip, as is diplomacy and characters trying their hardest to prevent (more) violence. Of course I was hooked.

I didn’t find Xandri super relatable per se despite being autistic myself, it manifests in different ways for me in general and I’m far less able to deal with people, but some aspects definitely resonated with me deeply. The zoo scene with infodumping about animals? Put me in a zoo that has zebras or antelopes and I would do the same. And seeing a character deal with some of the same struggles, written well and by an author who is also autistic – it matters.

The worldbuilding was…fine, if somewhat surface-level. I often wished that aliens would act a little more alien, if that makes sense, or that the cultural worldbuilding was deeper. It might be unfair on my part, but I can’t help but compare to first contact masters like Cherryh or Arnason or Le Guin, and it falls disappointingly short.

But my biggest issue was with the plot, especially the last quarter of the book or so. I absolutely hate when a protagonist’s blunder or the identity of the antagonist is obvious from the orbit and no one, not one person notices what’s going on until it’s too late. Xandri was not alone. She *always* had multiple trusted people with her, bodyguards, friends from the Carpathia, her diplomacy crew, or a combination of those. I would understand if one or two of them didn’t realise. But every single supposedly smart and/or people-savvy person catching the [idiot ball](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall) and the whole ending hinging on that is too much.

Since I still have hope that the next book won’t make the same mistake, I will gladly continue the series.

Review originally on [JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/a-feather-so-black-fair-folk-1-by-lyra-selene)

Fair Folk #1  
r/fantasy bingo: First in series; Romantasy; Published in 2024

 

*A Feather So Black* is the first book in the *Fair Folk* series, a romantasy proposal written by Lyra Selene, and which represents her adult debut, published by Orbit Books. When the Folk stole the High Queen's daughter, they left Fia, a rare changeling behind; magic has been lost from the kingdom, and the Folk are hated by most. By extension, Fia is also hated due to her origin.

However, the High Queen has raised her to be a spy and a weapon for the kingdom, as her own daughter; her actual daughter, Eala, is lost and bound to Tir na nÓg, cursed to only show her true form during nights. But when a hidden gate to the Folk realm is discovered, the Queen tasks Fia with retrieving her daughter and break the curse, in the company of Prince Rogan, Eala's betrothed. 

But once they start their journey through the Folk's world, their mission will prove to be harder than it seemed; not only due to Rogan's feelings towards Fia, and the mystery behind Eala's curse, but also because Fia's starts developing a bond towards the dark-fae captor to which Eala's is bound, Iaran.  
And seriously, Selene has outdone herself at creating Fia; raised as a weapon, made strong by the circumstances, and she's only trying to fulfill the Queen's mission. You find yourself cheering for her and her cursed love, especially once the secret behind Iaran is revealed; she's snarky and decided, and at the end will be put in front of tough choices.

Even with the clear influences you can guess in the plot, Selene manages to include certain twists that make it really enjoyable to read. Romance wise, I found it really engaging to read, kinda slow burn but well threaded in between the plot advances, reinforcing the emotional weight implied in Fia's journey; maybe I would have liked to know more about Iaran, as it felt a bit too abrupt how Fia falls in love for him.

The magical nature of Tir na nÓg is perfectly captured through the onirical and descriptive prose of Lyra Selene; the attention to detail and how many of the Celtic mythology is blended into the world makes it even more memorable, in conjunction with many sentences that by themselves deserve to be highlighted.

*A Feather so Black* is an excellent debut, which blends Celtic mythology with romantasy plots and tropes; emotional damage is all over there. And after how it ends, we can only hope time passes faster so we receive *A Crown so Silver* as soon as possible.",Fantasy

1712089421.0,The Saint of Bright Doors: A Review,"TL;DR A brilliant but frustrating work. Worth every penny, though: 4/5 stars. 

Where do I begin with this thing? Its blurb tells you quite a bit about what to expect: 
> Fetter was raised to kill, honed as a knife to cut down his sainted father. This gave him plenty to talk about in therapy.
> 
> He walked among invisible devils and anti-gods that mock the mortal form. He learned a lethal catechism, lost his shadow, and gained a habit for secrecy. After a blood-soaked childhood, Fetter escaped his rural hometown for the big city, and fell into a broader world where divine destinies are a dime a dozen.
> 
> Everything in Luriat is more than it seems. Group therapy is recruitment for a revolutionary cadre. Junk email hints at the arrival of a god. Every door is laden with potential, and once closed may never open again. The city is scattered with Bright Doors, looming portals through which a cold wind blows. In this unknowable metropolis, Fetter will discover what kind of man he is, and his discovery will rewrite the world.

From the very beginning, this is an exciting and *weird* story. It doesn’t read like any other ‘edgy teenage assassin’ I’ve ever seen; the preamble reads like you’re in a cult (rightly so), and the meat of the story is this dizzying clash between the strange and surreal (with talk of devils and names like Mother-in-Glory) and the modern mundane (therapy, phones, social media). The prose is *divine* at points — Chandrasekara is clearly a master of the written word, and uses vocabulary and style incredibly well where it matters.

The plot itself is what I would consider my main hiccup with this. It’s strangely passive — and for the most part of the book, this is fine, as it takes you along for a ride through the weirdly wonderful and yet familiar world of Luriat, with its ‘bright doors’ and its pogroms, its devils and its failed governments. And yet, when there is meant to be action, it feels a little detached — perhaps intentionally? — and lacking in scope. The revolutionary cadre mentioned in the blurb exists, and plays a big part in Fetter’s life — and yet, when they act, it is so far offscreen that we do not see it, or the actions we see onscreen turn out to be insignificant. Indeed, the machinations of Mother-of-Glory seem to play a bigger role — and yet, it is not particularly satisfying or conclusive when they come to fruition. 

Indeed, most of the journey seems to be about Fetter’s growth as a man, from tool forged by a vengeful woman to a power in his own right. He also stumbles over his own agency — which seems fitting — and struggles to be something more than just a leaf in the current, in both intention and action. For this sort of story, though, I would have liked to see more about his personal relationships, and how they progress as his situation changes — but this content is sorely lacking, almost deliberately. 

**Spoilers for the ending:** >!I can’t say I’m a fan of how matters were resolved. The end rings particularly hollow in my opinion, with Fetter having claimed to change the world through changing himself — and rejecting his mother’s ideas about violence and change. In the end, it seems to me that the change that Fetter was tasked with achieving instead comes to him as he drifts along in the current, as all the things in this story do. It is pleasing that he appears to have taken his life into his own hands, but he appears to have become more like his father in the process.!< I would also not say the story very conclusively resolves many of the mysteries it introduces, such as Fetter’s abilities or the bright doors — or his romantic relationships. 

It is worth noting that the author is a Sri Lankan (and I believe, but cannot confirm, a Buddhist). I had not viewed this work with that context until after finishing it. In that light, a lot of this book becomes much clearer — the references to the Paths as an oppressive, dividing force (in contrast to most ideas about Buddhism), the discussions about race science, and the pogroms all clearly reflect Sri Lankan politics over the last few decades. Viewed in this way, it becomes an even more striking and relevant book, and an even more valuable read for Western audiences. (And even South Asian audiences like myself, who have had the luxury of not having to worry about the crisis in Sri Lanka.)",Fantasy

1712077536.0,2023 Bingo Masterpost - All Translations Card,"I know this is a little late, but I finished the last book at around midnight right before the April 1 deadline, and then I needed to go to bed, and then needed a day to write all this up. So here it is, better posted late than never.

I’ve participated in Fantasy Bingo for a few years now, but for the first time this year I decided to do a themed card. I’d seen some other people’s themed cards and thought it looked fun. Some people’s themes were downright impressive.

And so I said to myself, I’m going to do a card with nothing but translations.

And then, when I started planning out my card and saw that the whole thing was dominated by two or three languages, I modified my theme: All translations, with one language per square. No repeats. If you use Spanish for one square, you can’t use any more books translated from Spanish.

In hindsight, this might have been a mistake. Some languages have a lot of translated material to work with, and some languages have one obscure fantasy book that only special collection college libraries have in their catalog. I found myself not picking the translations I was most interested in, but based on how to best fill the more restrictive squares. There really aren’t that many fantasy series that get translated, nor does there seem to be much of a market for translated superheroes, and Book Club had only read translations from three languages when bingo kicked off, though now I believe that number is up to 4. (Though it’s entirely possible I missed a book at some point when scrolling through the goodreads list.) So while, for instance, Our Share of Night was the most interesting newly released translation last year (for me personally,) I needed to save Spanish for the Book Club square, because the only historical book club selections I was seeing that were also translations were translated from Spanish, Polish, and Russian, and I needed Polish for the Sequel square and would likely need Russian for the Bottom of the TBR square, since the only translations that had been on my TBR list for long enough to fit were from Russian, Spanish, and Japanese, and I needed Japanese for the Superhero square and the Spanish book was the same as the Spanish Book Club book…

You can see how this quickly added a layer of difficulty beyond just finding 25 different languages that had a fantasy book already translated into English that also fit a square on the card.

Another layer of difficulty was my realization that publishers will call anything magical realism. Truly, if a book is translated from another language and there’s an extended metaphor drawn from folklore, or if said folklore is treated as serious and real by the characters and forms a key part of how they interpret the world, then it will be labeled magical realism. Even if no creatures from folklore actually, unambiguously appear or do anything that can’t be reasonably explained by the reader without folklore. I had so many squares that I had to come up with a back-up for because my initial selection turned out to not be speculative enough to count in my mind. I did end up keeping some books that were right on the line as a judgment call, but I discarded anything that did not have any speculative elements at all, or whose only speculative elements were that the book was set in a made-up country or that the characters sincerely believed in their folklore.

Still, it was a good challenge, and pulling it off felt like a real achievement.

**Title w/ a Title: The King of the Copper Mountains by Paul Biegel (Dutch)**

So this actually wasn’t by first choice for this square. I was going to use \*\***A Letter to the King\*\*** instead, but unfortunately, despite being listed as a fantasy book when I was initially looking into it, it didn’t really have much in the way of speculative elements. I thought I was good as gold when I saw the magic powers in the Netflix show based off that book, but it turns out Netflix added the magic powers, and no one in the books does any magic. So I ended up reading The King of the Copper Mountains as a last-minute back-up instead. It’s cute enough, but definitely meant for a younger audience, which I knew going in.

**Superheroes: Sailor Moon by Naoko Takeuchi (Japanese)**

This was a difficult square, but I think Sailor Moon is close enough to count as a super hero. This one had a little bit of a slow start - it takes a while to gather people up and introduce them, but I guess sometimes you just need to take your time. I think I would have enjoyed this more a few years ago, but it was still perfectly enjoyable now.

**Bottom of the TBR: The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov (Russian)**

I’ve been meaning to read this one for a long time now, but never seemed to get around to it. It didn’t end up being at all what I’d expected- I’d heard a lot of praise for its themes, for it’s connection to the Soviet Era, but not about the humor. I listened to this one on audiobook, and the narrator did a pretty good job differentiating each character with a speaking role. Overall pretty enjoyable.

**Magical Realism: Red Ants by Pergentino José (Sierra Zapotec)**

So technically I think this one might have been translated into English from the Spanish translation of the original Sierra Zapotec - my copy of the book wasn’t super clear whether it was translated directly from the original version or not - but since it was originally written in Sierra Zapotec that’s what I’m counting it as. This was a collection of magical realism short stories, which on the whole were pretty enjoyable to read. They were very short - I don’t think there was a single one longer than maybe six pages - so there wasn’t a whole lot of time for complex development or characterization, but the writing was vivid and many scenes were haunting even when it wasn’t really clear what was going on.

**YA: Mountain of the Moon by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay (Bengali)**

This one is right on the cusp of not being speculative enough. However, right towards the end, there is an encounter with a creature that doesn’t really exist, a sort of mythical creature, and I decided it was enough to count. This was a fun adventure-style book, though definitely written for a younger audience and requiring quite a suspension of disbelief. I’m not convinced that it’s humanly possible to cross the distances the characters claim to have crossed in the time they claim to have done it through the biomes they described - hey, perhaps that should be the speculative element.

This book is a ‘kumar-sahitya’ novel, a genre of Bengali literature that is a sort of a mix between adventure story, travelogue, and light fantasy-thriller aimed at a younger (but not too young) audience. I made the executive decision that this was close enough to YA, as the audience age range is about the same, as far as I can tell. Since this one was originally published in the 1930s, I expected it to feel more dated than it did; while some attitudes and ideas about Africa were certainly a bit dated, they were nowhere near as dated as they could be, and the text itself didn’t show its age as clearly as I would have expected. Perhaps that is the result of translation choices, with the translator opting to go for a more timeless tone; I don’t know enough about Bengali literature to compare.

**Mundane Jobs: Man Tiger by Eka Kurniawan (Indonesian)**

This one is another maybe-magical realism one that I decided was magical-realism-enough to count. As far as I could tell, the white tiger that lives inside our protagonist is both metaphorical and physically real.

This book is one of those books that seems to be moving slowly and not doing a lot until all of a sudden it all snaps together. It opens with a certain sense of urgency- a young man has just committed a violent murder, and it is not entirely clear why. Then the novel seemingly decides to set that mystery aside and slowly introduce us to our main character’s mother, father, sisters, extended family, girlfriend, girlfriend’s family and extended family until you want to scream ‘yes, these families are full of disappointments and problems but what are we even building towards here? Then, on the very last page, it all finally snaps together so perfectly that retroactively that long, slow middle feels genius and necessary.

**Published in the 00s: The Man Who Spoke Snakish by Andrus Kivirähk (Estonian)**

This is another one that I’d heard about and had been intending to check out for a while now but never really got around to. I enjoyed this one; it did a good job developing ideas about tradition and modernity and forcing them out of their dichotomy with each other. I’m not sure how I feel about the ending section, which I would describe as a crescendo of senseless though perhaps thematically-appropriate violence, but I definitely can’t fault it on thematic grounds.

**Angels and Demons: Forest of a Thousand Daemons: A Hunter’s Saga by D.O. Fagunwa (Yoruba)**

This book wasn’t my favorite, but I’m hesitant to bad-mouth it too much. It was first published in the ‘30s, like Mountains of the Moon, and draws heavily on a sort of syncretism between Christianity and traditional West African thought and myth. As such, I feel like I’m missing a lot of context while reading this one. However, I must say that sometimes our hero’s adventures felt a bit pointless and all of the women characters were treated pretty terribly. On the other hand, it certainly wasn’t boring, which is a point in its favor.

**Short Stories: Creative Surgery by Clelia Farris (Italian)**

This was a fun, short little collection; the two stand-out stories were one about what a young man is willing to sacrifice to protect the ancient burial ground he lives on and the titular story, featuring appropriately horrifying surgery. No one in that last story is passing their ethics classes.

I’d originally picked out a different collection for this square, a collection of short stories translated from a variety of Filipino languages. Unfortunately, while that collection was recommended to me on a list of translated FANTASY books, less than half of the stories were speculative, and fewer than half of those were unambiguously speculative.

**Horror: Let The Right One In by John Ajvide Lindqvist (Swedish)**

God this was a bleak book. Good, but bleak. I could feel the hard gray concrete-ness of the story’s setting permeate every section that I read. Truly there was no beauty to be found in the setting- the only beauty in this entire book comes from the (somewhat rare) scenes where people trust another person and have that trust vindicated. And honestly, I feel like that worked really well for this story. I would definitely recommend it, though with the caveat that it’s not the right choice if you’re looking for a light, fun pick-me-up read.

**Self-Published/Indie: When I Sing, Mountains Dance by Irene Solà (Catalan)**

This book book was just the right length for what it was. Each chapter focused on one character in or with a connection somehow to a family living in a small village in the Pyrenees, and is not-quite self-contained. Things are just connected enough to keep the book from being just interconnected short stories. One of the things I liked a lot about this book was the broad definition of ‘person with connection to the family.’ There were bits from the POV of the mountains, from the POV of a deer in the forest nearby, and a bit from the POV of the weather. The writing is gorgeous, which pairs well with the decidedly non-human narration of the non-human POV sections and makes the creative POV choices stand out even more. If you like fantasy and are looking for something with smaller stakes and less charging off to fight a dragon, I can recommend this book.

**Set in the Middle East: The Emperor Tea Garden by Nazlı Eray (Turkish)**

I don’t entirely feel that I got this one, even though it was a fun read. For a while I thought the narrator was in fact two different people, and I’m still not entirely convinced that they weren’t. I didn’t much care for any of the characters, which put a little bit of a damper on my enjoyment.

This was another one where the book I finally chose for the square was an emergency back-up because my planned choice didn’t end up being speculative enough for me to feel that it counted.

**Published in 2023: No Edges: Swahili Stories by Various Authors (Swahili)**

This collection was both more and less entertaining than I had expected, which is sort of par for the course with short story collections like this. Some stories were more fun than others. On average I’d give it three stars.

**Multiverse: The Neverending Story by Michael Ende (German)**

I don’t know how much of my enjoyment of this book was because it is a genuinely fun, entertaining read with plenty of adventure and interesting creatures and inventive settings and how much was because I read it on the heels of two mildly disappointing books and two extremely disappointing books, one of which was quite possibly the worst book I’ve read in the past decade (and which, unfortunately, will be reviewed further down this post). I needed a win after that disappointing streak, and The Neverending Story delivered.

**POC Author: The Wizard of the Crow by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o (Gikuyu)**

This book was incredible. I’d heard it praised often before, so I came in with high expectations, but it met those expectations beautifully, and now I’m going around recommending it to my IRL book club and my coworkers and my mom. I’ve never seen a book balance its tone between comedy and fear so perfectly for so long- not once over the nearly 800 pages did it swerve too far into one side or the other.

**Book Club: Kalpa Imperial: The Greatest Empire that Never Was by Angélica Gorodischer (Spanish)**

Ever since I learned that Ursula K. Le Guin translated this book I’ve been meaning to read it. I’ve heard it praised often on this sub, and the title was intriguing. Thankfully, it met all of my expectations. Each story had both fun and inventive bits and real meat that you could chew on without getting bogged down. It’s rare for what is essentially a collection of stories, albeit all linked by their shared setting, to be this consistently good from story to story.

**Novella: The Employees by Olga Ravn (Danish)**

This was a weird one. The author’s background is in poetry, and you can really see it in how abstract much of this book is. There might not even be a single named character. It’s supposedly a sort of found-footage-type book in the form of interviews conducted by a company with their human and humanoid employees aboard a spaceship of some sort. However, we don’t see the questions, only the responses, and while some people are clearly interviewed more than once and time clearly passes, each interview is labeled only with a number- no name, no context, nothing at all. The numbers appear to be chronological, proceeding from interview #1 to interview #2 to #20 to # 131 and so on, but it’s impossible to tell if they’re truly chronological or just roughly chronological, and some numbers are missing. However, despite all this, there are some really neat, hit-you-upside-the-head lines, and the author still managed to create a sense of rising tension.

**Mythical Beasts: Fishing for the Little Pike by Juhani Karila (Finnish)**

This was a fun one. It switches back and forth between a woman who needs to catch a specific pike fish or she will die and the detective trying to track her down for her suspected role in a murder. All along the way are a variety of fabulous, creepy creatures and witchcraft.

I’d never read anything from the ‘Finnish Weird’ subgenre before, mostly because their summary blurbs never seem that interesting to me, but I might have to give some more of them a try after Fishing for the Little Pike.

**Elemental Magic: Thunderbird by Sonia Nimr (Arabic)**

This book had so many problems, but I am reluctant to judge it too harshly because I suspect they are not really the fault of the book itself. At first, as I was reading, I asked myself what editor would ever agree to publish something so weirdly paced. Basic information about the premise and how the speculative elements functioned was still being revealed at the ⅔ point, our heroine accepted her magic time-travel quest with maybe three chapters and twenty pages left to go, thematic elements were introduced to early or too late, things that should have been short subplots went on for far too long relative to the length of the book- the list of structural weirdnesses went on and on.

Then, I had an aha-moment. This book wasn’t translated by a recognizable commercial publisher or an indie publisher that deals with international literature, but by a Center for Middle East Studies affiliated with some university, and it had a “sequel” that had the exact same name with a ‘book 2’ appended to the end. I began to suspect that this had been translated not as a Middle Grade fantasy novel but as a piece of literature by a Palestinian author that discusses Israel-Palestine relations, and that the pervasive structural issues and abrupt ending that didn’t resolve anything were because the grant money to pay the translator ran out before the book did, hence it being split up into multiple pieces in the translation process. I can’t rag on a book for having terrible, nonsensical structure and no real resolution if those issues are only issues because I’m only reading the first third or so of the book.

On a side note, it was nice to see a Middle Grade book where the main character goes to their parents/parental figures and tells them about the frightening and unprovable supernatural things that are happening to them and have said parental figures believe them immediately and start taking practical steps to help them.

**Myths and Retellings: Baba Yaga Laid an Egg by Dubravka Ugrešić (Croatian)**

God I hated this book. I hated this book so much that when I was thinking back over my year of reading back in December, I initially thought this had been a bad year for me, with too many disappointing and uninspiring books. Then I realized that actually, this one book was just bringing down my entire perception of the year; I kept getting bored or frustrated and putting it down ‘just for a moment,’ and then before I knew it it was due back at the library, and then I’d have to check it out again and restart from where I’d left off, which meant that I ended up reading it over the course of several months, a little bit at a time. Because it was so spread out, it felt in retrospect like I’d had several months of unenjoyable reads.  
For a while I wasn’t even sure if this was speculative enough to count- there’s only a moment or two of blink-and-you-miss-it magic. However, it must have been speculative enough for the Otherwise Award judges, because it won in 2010. (How??? How did this garbage win any kind of award??? Was 2010 just a really bad year for books related to gender and/or sexuality in speculative fiction? Did it run unopposed???) Also, I felt true despair at the idea of slogging through the whole book only to not count it, so I elected to count it.

**Queernorm: Little Mushroom: Revelations by Shisi (Chinese)**

This is technically part two of a single book, which was split into two books when it was translated into English. I wish it hadn’t been split, since I think some of the character and relationship development in this book would have hit harder and made more sense if there wasn’t a big gap dividing the first half from the second half like that. However, I did still enjoy myself.

Some ideas from this one reminded me of ideas from the first Three Body Problem book, which now leaves me curious whether these ideas are just more common in Chinese sci-fi or if this book actively took inspiration from the Three Body Problem. Or maybe the Three Body Problem was just such a big hit that some of its ideas have become pervasive in Chinese sci-fi publishing. I guess I’ll just have to read more Chinese sci-fi to find out.

**Coastal/Island: Hadriana in All My Dreams by René Depestre (French)**

One of the most interesting things about this book was how different its zombies were from the zombies I’m used to. These ones were much more rooted in voodoo and the history of slavery than the zombies I come across in other fantasy books. In fact, these zombies aren’t even that much of a danger to other people; the primary danger is to the zombified person’s own spiritual well-being. It ended up not becoming a new favorite, but reading it was still a valuable exercise.

**SUBSTITUTION- Non-Human Character: Walking Practice by Dolki Min (Korean)**

I was initially turned off from this book by the description- I wasn’t really interested in watching an alien hunt and eat people. However, I saw it getting some praise on this sub, and as the Bingo deadline loomed I needed something short. I’m glad I ended up reading this one- it was a lot more entertaining than I had expected.

**Robots: R. U. R. by Karel Čapek (Czech)**

This work was the first to use the word ‘robot’, and could debatably be called the first ever robot story (though of course, stories of artificial, debatably-alive creatures predate it.) That is part of why I picked it- I was curious about the first robot story.

I can see how this would have been incredibly compelling to see live on stage when it was first written; however, since then other authors have done much more interesting and thought-provoking things with the subject, so this felt unfairly boring. I suspect it would have been better as it was meant to be experienced- as a stage play- but I’m not sure that would have been enough to make up for the simple fact that robots are not a new idea that can carry a story by itself anymore.

**Sequel: The Time of Contempt by Andrzej Sapkowski (Polish)**

This one was much like the first book in the series. I think I enjoy the style and pacing of this series, where only the important scenes necessary to move the plot along are included- there’s not much in the way of connective tissue scenes or and-now-it’s-going-to-take-fifty-pages-to-get-to-the-city sections; anything that can be skipped over is skipped over. This makes things a little more disjointed, and definitely makes it harder to keep track of how much time has passed, but in return it makes each scene feel high-impact and important, as well as nearly self-contained.

Although standalones particularly in fantasy can be harder to come by than other genres. I am trying to read some of the favourites of the genre and newer stuff that has popped up more recently. 

Lowest reviewed to highest.

**Shadows Linger by Glen Cook**

Basic Outline- Book two of The Black Company. After the epic confrontation at the end of the last book Croaker and company have been sent far east to continue hunting down rebels. Little do they know that back in the west some familiar faces have cropped up and a mysterious and menacing castle has arisen which could spell doom for all. 

Thoughts- Diving into this book was very easy after thoroughly enjoying the first in the series. Time has passed and Croaker and crew are a little more weathered, older and frankly depressed. The Black Company seems adrift and are losing themselves. The way Cook describes this is very well done and you can feel the weight that has settled on many of the members of the company. Croaker continues to be a fantastic protagonist, capable but also flawed. A new POV character is also introduced Shed who is our eyes and ears over on the Western part of the world for most of the novel. This was an interesting decision which I can imagine might have upset some readers who had become accustomed to Croaker. I didn’t have a real problem with Shed’s story and even though he was fairly repugnant and deplorable he grew on me and Cook wrote him well enough that by the end you really felt for him. This book feels smaller scale than the last novel and even though it has large scale implications for the Black Company by the end it felt like a bit of a middle novel. There were a few moments where I wanted to move along to the next event in Croaker or Shed’s story and felt a little bogged down in this or that. Once again though, despite these flaws I am still intrigued in where we are going and love the folks I am travelling with. A minor question for those who have read the entire saga, does each trilogy have a complete ending, or do they all meld together into one complete series? 

Rating- 3.5/5 stars. Not as good as the first book in the series but still contains the great characters and world that Cook has developed. Suffers a bit from feeling like a middle book. 

**Tooth and Claw by Jo Walton**

Basic Outline- Pride & Prejudice & Dragons? When their father dies a family is torn apart by grief, distance and dispute. Primarily over the distribution of his body and who got to eat the choicest pieces….

Thoughts- Ok the outline while slightly over the top but when I heard the premise for this book I really thought it would be more Austen type storytelling than dragon fights and cannibalism. It is, but there is a lot more of the dragon-ey stuff in here than I expected. Which ultimately was a good thing for me. The story is mostly split into three with each part following one of the siblings effected by the inheritance dispute. The son we follow is suing his brother in law for taking advantage of the family and follows his city living trying to make his own way in the world. It might be weakest of the three stories for me with his live in disgraced partner being a good character but with many rushed elements specifically towards the end of the book which I found underdeveloped. The next part (they are all interwoven chapter by chapter) follows one of the maiden sisters as she moves in with her priest brother after nearly being assaulted and married off to a scoundrel parson. Selendra is her name and her story was by far my favourite and the best developed. The intrigue about will she be able to be married successfully (no spoilers but there are many complications including her prior victimization) is the best in the book and has some of the best adventures and characters. The third part involve the other maiden sister Haner moving in with her sister and the brother in law who overstepped his bounds for inheritance. I enjoyed the villainy and the awful conditions of the brother in law in his domain and the casual bystander factor that Haner observes and tries to rail against but once again many parts seem rushed or underwritten particularly Haner’s “cause” later on in the book. Overall, I enjoyed what Walton created with this novel but feel like it could have used a sequel or even a trilogy to fully explore the ideas and characters within. As is there is a lot of fun to be had imagining dragons in tricorn hats arguing in court about who should have gotten the biggest piece of their father’s flesh to eat so they can grow larger.  

Rating-3.5/5 stars. A really unique mashup of Austen style storytelling mixed in with the casual bloodthirstiness of dragons. Too many conveniences and rushing the ending holds this book back from being great. 

**Legends & Lattes by Travis Baldree**

Basic Outline- Viv the orc has decided to hang up her sword and forge a new, less bloody path for herself. Her dream is to open her own coffee shop, but will her past allow her to?

Thoughts- This is my first foray into the “cozy” genre and I have to say as a palette cleanser from the usual wicked villains and epic battles of other fantasy novels this was a great change of pace. The stakes are fairly low but meaningful to the characters that Baldree introduces us to. That might be the best aspect of this pleasant story is the menagerie of characters populating Viv;s coffee shop. From a stoic hob carpenter, to a reserved succubus and probably my favourite an almost mute rattkin baker they all have their quirks and moments of importance to the building and operation of Viv’s dream. There are many obstacles in the way of achieving this personal dream but everyone works together and supports each other in a way that is beyond wholesome. I wish there was a little more backstory to a few of the characters (we get a little more about Viv’s in the attached prequel short story “*Pages to Fill”* included in my version), particularly Tandri who I was curious about many aspects of her former life. I also felt like there were moments that felt slightly rushed in particular when it comes to some of the romantic aspects of the book. It would be unkind to label something like this as fluff but it is definitely a nice easy going read that is not overly challenging and just delightful in the way the characters behave and interact with their world. 

Rating-3.5/5 stars. This is close to a 4 star. Extremely pleasant and positive. I would be interested in reading another book in this world to change lanes from the usual swords and blackhearts that we become accustomed to. WARNING will make you want a cup of coffee and baked goods!

**The White Rose by Glen Cook**

Basic Outline- Book three of The Black Company. After the events of *Shadows Linger* the company is on the run and holed up in a disturbing and precarious position out in the magical Plains of Fear. Croaker begins receiving letters detailing the origins of the infamous mage Bomanz who resurrected the Lady centuries ago. Who is sending them and how they will they help decide the fate of the North?

Thoughts- Glen Cook continues to write such an enjoyable story with endearing characters that adds new layers each book to the lore and world building. The main lets say 7 characters that we have followed throughout this initial three books are so familiar now that you know them like old friends (or enemies). A minor complaint I have is that there are a few characters that Cook wants us to care about and they unfortunately are not as well realized even though they have been with us for three books (I am mainly talking about Elmo and The Lieutenant). Otherwise the ongoing shenanigans between One-Eye and Goblin are still here, the stoic badassery of Silent, the sarcastic romanticism of Croaker and maybe even a few returning character surprises. Without getting into spoilers there are some fabulous moments with Croaker and a certain someone. I immensely enjoyed the world building of the Plains of Fear which started out as being truly bizarre and unexplained but grew on me with their strange denizens especially the windwhales and the menhir (rock people). The relationships between everyone crescendo in this book and the final confrontation was appropriately epic. I am very interested in seeing where The Black Company goes from here since this does seem like the end of an era (despite a good little teaser into potential future evils). One other minor issue I had was, perhaps just my own but when it came to the origins of two new characters (Tracker and Toadkiller Dog) I seemed to have missed the initial explanation of where they came from and why there were there. It became clear in the third act but there is something about Cook’s writing that sometimes I feel slightly lost about certain things. 

Rating-4/5 stars. Close to a 4.5. The Black Company’s first three books end on a high note. This is a great fantasy saga with complex and interesting characters which I can recommend to anyone who enjoys the darker side of the genre. 

**Best Served Cold by Joe Abercrombie**

Basic Outline- The first standalone novel in The First Law universe sees a new setting, Styria. The constant struggle for power and domination has caused the recent times to be labelled The Years of Blood in the country and at the forefront is Monza Murcatto and her brother Benna. When Monza is left broken and betrayed she will mark many of the most prominent figures in the country for vengeance. Will she succeed? Who will she recruit in her quest for revenge? 

Thoughts- I loved the original First Law trilogy and had heard from many that this standalone is the best of the bunch and I wasn’t disappointed. It was a nice change of pace to be somewhere new and be introduced to a mostly new cast (with a few exceptions) since Abercrombie is one of the best character writers in the business. Some of my favourites included the return of the untrustworthy merc with a heart only for gold (or maybe not) Cosca and the deluded poisoner Morveer. Abercrombie is still the master of making despicable people somewhat likable or at least interesting. The way he weaves the tale of Murcatto you easily understand her motivations at least at the start of the novel and want her to take her revenge. One of my favourite tropes from any sort of media is the assembling of a crew where each character gets their little introduction and how the personalities clash or jive. It worked so well in this that when things start to fall apart for them later in the book I missed the dynamic of the group immensely. It went along at a great pace for me until about 5/7ths (if you have read the book you might get the choice here) and then it sort of hit a skid for a while which slowed down the great momentum. That hiccup aside the finale was great and the book ended in an unexpected but satisfying way (well for Abercrombie satisfying rarely equals happy but it was enough to continue holding up The First Law as some of the best fantasy books I have read in years). 

Rating-4.5/5 stars. Another excellent entry into The First Law universe. Great characters, interesting arcs and with one pacing issue and amazing novel. Can’t wait for the next adventure!

1712069040.0,2024 Reading in Review | First Quarter,"Rather than do a single huge post at the end of the year as I’ve been doing, where I have to pare down discussions to fit everything, I thought it might be fun—and slightly more manageable—to do a review at the end of each quarter this year. Hopefully this will let me highlight more books before recency bias causes them to fade in my memory, as well as write about more titles that I want to comment on. So, here’s what my reading looked like for January through March.

### Classics

I read a couple of sci-fi classics for the first time: **Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?** by Phillip K. Dick and **The Female Man** by Joanna Russ.

Like **The Man in the High Castle**, I found **Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?** an interesting look at PKD’s thoughts on the nature of reality and man, performativity and social pressure, and empathy, but not really an emotionally engaging tale.

**The Female Man** was less a coherent story than a series of thought experiments and essays about sexism, sometimes hilarious encounters pointing out the absurdities of misogyny, and some strange inquiries about queerness. It made for an interesting conversation in a bookclub and a read that I appreciated for requiring real effort and engagement; it’s not a book that’s going to leave my brain anytime soon though either, so credit to it for effectiveness. It also convinced me to pick up Russ’s **How To Suppress Women’s Writing** which I found an excellent and approachable nonfiction. There’s a clear distillation of the ideas and frustrations vented in *The Female Man* into the evidence she presents in *How To Suppress Women’s Writing*.

### New Releases

I had the privilege to access several ARCs for titles I was very excited about this year: **What Feasts at Night** by T. Kingfisher, **Womb City** by Tlotlo Tsamaase, **Redsight** by Meredith Mooring, **The Dead Cat Tail Assassins** by P. Djèlí Clark, and **A Botanical Daughter** by Noah Medlock.

**What Feasts at Night** was a delightful follow-up to **What Moves the Dead** and I was happy to get another adventure with Easton and Angus. It didn’t quite live up to its predecessor, and I was a little disappointed by >!Miss Potter being relegated to a plot device and forgettable bystander!<. Regardless, Kingfisher stories are always a good time, and even with the small disappointments I enjoyed my time with the story and characters.

**Womb City** was a tough and dark book, and while I found it very engaging, the writing style was at times challenging and the topics and characters could be difficult to engage with. Not what I’d classify an enjoyable read, but a worthwhile one nonetheless. [Full review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/19czoex/arc_review_womb_city_by_tlotlo_tsamaase/).

**Redsight** caught my attention with comps to *Dune* and promises of “sapphic romance, space pirates, a blind witch and powerful priestesses”. What I got was a triad of warring religious cults and a fairly bland MC who is the only hope for a better future, none of which I cared about. The worldbuilding simply failed to interest me and there was no emotional engagement to the characters for me. I DNF’d at 30%.

**The Dead Cat Tail Assassins** was a bit different than what I’ve come to expect from a P. Djèlí Clark novel. I try not to pigeonhole authors based on their previous work as I don’t actually want to read the same thing over and over, but this one felt like it lacked the depth of a P. Djèlí Clark world. It was a fun time, fast paced and humorous with endearing characters, and more than a little bloody at times. Go into this one for an entertaining fantasy thriller and I think you’ll have a great time.

Some relevant facts about me: 1—I love The Picture of Dorian Gray in a way that makes little sense even to me given how insufferable the narrative and characters can be, and 2—if you show me anything even vaguely billable as a *Frankenstein* retelling I will be immediately interested. (I recognize that this feels contradictory to my above statement about not wanting the same thing over and over and I don’t know what to tell you; I contain multitudes^(\[)[^(1)](https://poets.org/poem/song-myself-51)^(\]).) So when **A Botanical Daughter** was advertised as “*Mexican Gothic* meets *The Lie Tree* by way of Oscar Wilde and Mary Shelley”, you can be damned sure I hit Request with all possible speed. And *A Botanical Daughter* was not a disappointment; I think it delivered reasonably well on the high expectations the above tagline set, and I will be looking for future works by the author. [Full review here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1bf0qzr/arc_review_a_botanical_daughter_by_noah_medlock/).

### Middle Grade & Children’s

A few books to report on here: **The Island of Whispers** by Frances Hardinge, **Sir Callie and the Champions of Helston** and **Sir Callie and the Dragon’s Roost** by Esme Symes-Smith, and **The Skull** by Jon Klassen.

**The Island of Whispers** is a gorgeously illustrated and somewhat tragic adventure centering grief, but with a lovely and hopeful conclusion.

**Sir Callie** is an indulgent adventure about kids standing up for themselves and others in a world that wants to dismiss them. The narrative is perhaps a little on-the-nose in regard to queer kids and the factions that try to use them for their own ends, and I had some issues with book 2 and the way it handled things. I’m reserving total judgement until I see how things ultimately shake out in book 3.

**The Skull** is a weird little fairytale sort of thing with fantastic art. I really don’t know what the target audience is for this one, the text is fairly accessible to even a young reader but the story is just so odd and somewhat morbid. A bemusing little book, but I enjoyed it.

And because I recently read and enjoyed the essay, some quotes on reading children's fiction as an adult:

>Children will not be patient if you pontificate or meander or self-congratulate. Rather, children’s fiction necessitates distillation: at its best, it renders in their purest, most archetypal forms hope, hunger, joy, fear. Think of children’s books as literary vodka.  
>  
>Children’s fiction today is still shot through with exactly the same old furious thirst for justice that characterises fairytales. \[…\] And, too, knitted closely into the need for justice, there is a related stance, the happier cousin of protective retribution: that of wonder \[…\] So it’s to children’s fiction that you turn if you want to feel awe and hunger and longing for justice: to make the old warhorse heart stamp again in its stall.  
>  
>Children’s books say: the world is huge. They say: hope counts for something. They say: bravery will matter, wit will matter, empathy will matter, love will matter. These things may or may not be true. I do not know. I hope they are. I think it is urgently necessary to hear them and to speak them.

From [*Why You Should Read Children’s Books, Even Though You Are So Old And Wise*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44244323) by Katherine Rundell

### Continuing Series

Trying to follow up on some series I have started, I’ve made progress in a few. I read the next three novellas in the Penric and Desdemona series by Lois McMaster Bujold: **Penric’s Mission**, **Mira’s Last Dance**, and **The Prisoner of Limnos**. These were a bit odd in that the Penric in these novellas felt to me like a wholly different character to the Penric in the previous novellas. This little trilogy also reads more like a novel split into three parts rather than the more episodic stories I’d come to expect from the previous ones. Still, entertaining enough and lovely writing, but not my favorite entries. Reading these did give me the motivation to order the three main *World of the Five Gods* novels which I’ve never read, so we’ll call this a win overall.

I also read the new book in *The Tithenai Chronicles*, **All The Hidden Paths** by Foz Meadows. I… did not like this. This second book was—in a word—clumsy. It was 500 pages of angst, failure to communicate, and over-the-top drama. Plot events felt contrived so that the author could write whatever particular scenes were in their head, rather than feeling like a coherent story and character development.

I finally picked up the next Lady Trent memoir, **The Voyage of the Basilisk** by Marie Brennan. Another delightful adventure with Isabella and company. I really enjoyed getting to travel the world a bit more broadly in this installment, though it came at the expense of much depth about any one culture or dragon species. I didn’t find I missed the depth too much against all the excitement of events, but I wonder if this one will end up being more forgettable in the long run for being less focused.

### Other SFF Reads

**What the River Knows** by Isabel Ibañez : An historical YA novel with comps to *The Mummy*, this had such an incredibly strong and fun start. However, it was ultimately a disappointment as it got bogged down in over-the-top drama and teenage relationship woes in the latter half.

**The Tusks of Extinction** by Ray Nayler : Absolutely fantastic novella about memory, personhood, and the tragedies of greed. While I really enjoyed *The Mountain in the Sea* I didn’t find the interaction of the separate plot threads very satisfying there, but *The Tusks of Extinction* was tightly knit together and its conclusion effective.

**The Water Outlaws** by S.L. Huang : An historical fantasy adventure following Lin Chong, an expert arms instructor for the Empire, who is unjustly condemned as a criminal and ends up joining the Bandits of Liangshan. I really wanted this to focus on the banditry and fighting back against empire in small, meaningful ways among the common folk, but that’s not really where the focus of the story lies. It was good, well-written and interesting, but ultimately just fell a bit flat for me.

**Legends & Lattes** by Travis Baldree : Yes, I’m like 3 years late to this and yes, it’s delightful and endearing. Maybe I should offer my debt-holders cinnamon rolls in exchange for loan forgiveness. An enjoyable enough read but fairly hollow and I don’t think it’ll be something that’ll stick with me.

**Lady Macbethad** by Isabelle Schuller : An historical imagining of the figure who Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth is based upon. A fantastically strong and intriguing start following Gruoch through her childhood. I wanted to see her developed into a powerful woman with nuanced and justified motivations for her actions; the character writing here failed to convince me of anything beyond a sullen hunger for power and at the end of the narrative it didn’t feel like she’d been given any additional nuance. Somewhat disappointing but still a largely enjoyable read for its writing style.

**The Wicked + The Divine** by Kieron Gillen & Jamie McKelvie : A charismatic urban fantasy graphic novel series in which twelve gods are reborn every 90 years as young people; chaos ensues. In this iteration, the gods take on the role of pop stars and performers. This graphic novel has gorgeous art and a compelling mystery at its core, and I found its conclusion really well-done.

A new thing I’m tracking this year, because I keep having to explain how incongruent my Days To Read statistic seems compared to my Average Pages Per Day stat, is Time To Read. Basically, I’m using a timer with each book I read (except audiobooks) to see both how long it takes me to actually read it, and also show me how many books I’m reading consecutively. From this, we get two new graphs:

* Vol 11: Song of the Mysteries (this review)

**Publication Note**

Song of the Mysteries will be released in May 2024 – the audiobook and e-book editions will be available on May 23, with the hardcover edition following on May 28. (For anyone who has not yet started the series, an audiobook edition of Volume I: Curse of the Mistwraith is finally set to release on April 25).

**Song of the Mysteries**

*”...this is the ending I wanted, even if I didn't know how it would all turn out. Finally having the conclusion in front of me and finding NOTHING to be disappointed in is a very emotional and amazing feeling.”*

I sent this message to Janny Wurts on December 30, 2021 as a lucky beta reader of the manuscript. For two years, I had devoured chapters as they were drafted, capturing my immediate feelings so the author could judge how the book might be received by future readers. 

I'm not shy about sharing criticisms when I review a book (as can be seen in my other */r/fantasy* reviews), but I always strive to surface other strengths when certain aspects don't quite satisfy me. I offer this backstory for transparency and emphasis because, unconditionally, Song of the Mysteries works for me on every level. 

It works as a tightly-focused Story Arc V packed into a single, explosive volume. It works as the local conclusion to the Story Arc IV timeline, weaving the vast, abstract planetary perspective back together with the intimate, introspective character moments I loved in Story Arc II and III. Most importantly, it works as a culmination and callback to the entire 11-book series, resolving and reshaping everything that I've fervently read and reread over the past 30 years.

After feeling giddy and awestruck by the final chapters, I stepped away for almost a year as a palate cleanse. I then did a fresh reread of the entire series concluding with the final published version of Song of the Mysteries. I went at a stately tempo, savoring the unique style and musical language in the way the author intended (something I struggled to do in my first frantic readthrough when I wanted to know what happened next!) 

With all 11 volumes fresh in mind, I'm pleased to report that Song of the Mysteries still sticks the landing across every measure. This book should categorically silence the naysayers who suggested that the author might have been milking the length of the series or making things up on the fly. 

The Wars of Light and Shadow series is a massive geoglyph, painstakingly shaped by hand across miles and years. We may not have had the authorial bird's-eye view to see what it would become, but this final volume perfectly completes the image and vindicates the author's efforts.

The plot continues to move in unpredictable directions while painting new layers onto events from earlier books (especially Curse of the Mistwraith and Fugitive Prince). This volume isn't just about tying up loose ends though – it raises new moral conundrums and contextualizes current events in the weighty Paravian lore of the First and Second Ages. Any one of these historical asides is intriguing enough to be the germ for another novella in this universe, like The Gallant.

Be ready to take time off work for your first readthrough because good stopping points are rare (Chapter XIV is a decent saddle ridge to catch your breath before tackling the summit). The pacing forgoes any sort of slow burn and rarely lets up in intensity, with climactic events happening in almost every chapter. Every time I thought the book's language had reached a plateau in its ability to convey the tension, danger, and beauty of different scenes, the next chapter would prove to be even stronger. The tired joke about volume controls that go to 11 doesn't quite apply here because Song of the Mysteries starts at 11 and peaks around 16.

More than plot, pace, or prose, the character development is what I appreciate most about this volume. The characters I met as a teenager have matured through the lens of my own adulthood, and they all reap their earned conclusions – some tragic, some triumphant, and often a mix of both. Most rewarding for me was Tarens, the loyal crofter whose involvement in the plot didn't satisfy me when I first read Initiate's Trial in 2011. His development here completely dispels my indifference and he has become one of my favourite characters in the series.

Song of the Mysteries is the ending that the series deserves. It should simultaneously satisfy long-time fans while elevating the now-complete series to ""classic"" status for future readers to discover and appreciate. This series is absolutely worth trying if you're a patient fan of rewarding, intricate complexity, and it's a must-finish if you've paused temporarily somewhere in the middle.

1712062900.0,"Reading The Big Book of Cyberpunk, Week 10","Welcome to **Reading The Big Book of Cyberpunk**!

Each week we (u/FarragutCircle and u/fanny_bertram) will be reading 5-ish stories from Jared Shurin’s *The Big Book of Cyberpunk*, which includes a curated selection of cyberpunk stories written from 1950 to 2022! We’ll include synopses of the stories along with links to any legally available online versions we can find. Feel free to read along with us or just stop by and hear our thoughts about some cyberpunk stories to decide if any of them sound interesting to you.

**“Darkout” by E. Lily Yu** (published 2016; also available in the anthology *Cyber World* edited by Jason Heller & Joshua Viola)

In a privacy-less future, Brandon prefers to spend his time watching his ex and hoping she’ll take him back while darkout protests are happening in the background.

* **Farragut’s thoughts:** Yu won what is now the *Astounding* Award for Best New Writer in 2012 and came out with her debut novel *On Fragile Waves* a few years ago. This was an interesting *window* (ha!) into a potential future where everyone can be watched. Brandon clearly has unhealthy views on relationships (and friendships), and is pretty much a sad sack of a person. It was interesting to see how people embraced (or not) the “always on camera” lifestyle that I think some have adopted. I couldn’t stop thinking about the story of [JenniCam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Ringley), one of the first “lifecasters.” The ending of this story was oddly hopeful!

* **fanny’s thoughts:** I enjoyed this story and its look at how cams everywhere could go wrong. It takes the way we see vloggers and streamers and takes it to the extreme. You can watch anyone's life at any time and our MC Brandon is very disconnected from humanity because of this. He has one friend who is clearly using him. I particularly like the ending when we go from fully integrated with everyone to not in the blink of an eye. The whole story made me think about the “real-life” media I consume. 

**“2045 Dystopia” by Ryuko Azuma** (2018, translated from Japanese by Marissa Skeels) ([link to story (Twitter) ](https://twitter.com/ryuko_azuma/status/1073043889940922368)) [link may not work without a Twitter account]

A vision of the year 2045 is posited with giant cats, matchmaking services, and headless cows, though our narrator seems to have some things he needs to get out.

* **Farragut:** This comic was originally posted on Twitter (I believe), though whether or not it works is TBD. It starts off amusing (giant cats who eat noncitizens!) but quickly gets creepier (what the fuck did they do to that cow). As the title states, it’s quite dystopian, and it was interesting to see that the main character was at his limits due to what society had done in restricting life. It’s very cool that a comic was included; first time I’ve seen it in any of the Big Books (eat your heart out, Ann and Jeff!).

* **fanny:** I am so glad a comic was included in this! This was a strange dystopian future ruled by giant cats and DNA-matching for romance. There is a section about how animals feel and how removing that ability makes farming easier (or more humane, kind of unclear). Also there is an ejaculating cow. No, I don't know why.

**“Thoughts and Prayers” by Ken Liu** (2019) ([link to story](https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/thoughts-and-prayers-ken-liu-short-story.html))

The Fort family tries to grieve Hayley, killed in a mass shooting, in a world where trolling is worse than ever.

* **Farragut:** I’ve long been a big fan of Ken Liu’s work, having done a project about 7 years ago to read all of his then-published short fiction (about 120 at the time). This story is very hard to read, as it takes some of the trolling actions after things like the [Sandy Hook shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting) and supercharges it in a high-tech future with augmented reality glasses. The different family members (parents, sister, and aunt) all have different reactions, but the true pain for me is the obliteration of memory (the trolls got so bad even a simple image of Hayley couldn’t be seen). The interview with the self-serving troll that concludes the piece is just upsetting. By the way, the way Slate did Liu’s story meant that there’s a response essay by an online researcher that I thought was very interesting: [What’s in It for the Trolls?](https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/thoughts-and-prayers-response-trolls.html)

* **fanny:** This was brilliant, heartbreaking, and I don't want to read it again even though it made me feel a lot. It parallels the real world so much that sometimes it didn't feel fictional. It is a very dystopian, real look at the harm caused by Internet trolls and also the dehumanizing of victims of violence that happens. Each member of the family is torn apart by their grief after the mass shooting and they deal with the Internet trolls differently. 

**“Somatosensory Cortex Dog Mess You Up Big Time, You Sick Sack of S\*\*T” by Minister Faust** (2021; also available in the anthology *Cyberfunk!* edited by Milton J. Davis)

A young medical billionaire gets emotionally linked to a dog by a group whose lives he destroyed.

* **Farragut:** Minister Faust is a Kenyan-Canadian who ran for parliament back in 2004 and also has written some video games, as well as some batshit-looking books. This story features Marvin Shkully who is totally *not* Martin Shkreli (yes he is), who is finally forced to have a conscience. It’s told with some provocative language and Shkully is in fact a sick sack of shit. But it was funny and I liked it.

* **fanny:** The implant technology in this story is very cool. We mostly see it through this billionaire who has caused people to be infertile or have to spend a massive amount of money. He lacks any empathy towards humans or other creatures. Linking him to an animal recovering from surgery causes him to feel for the first time ever. I like this as a version of revenge and I appreciate that the author did not use it to fully redeem him, but show him trying to gain empathy. This story is weird though as there is also a bit of kink sex talk, but the empathy is the main thing.

**“The Life Cycle of a Cyber Bar” by Arthur Liu** (2021, translated from Chinese by Nathan Faries) ([link to story](https://future-sf.com/fiction/the-life-cycle-of-a-cyber-bar/))

The last sentient bar has a few goals in life, and goes about it in the most confusing way.

* **Farragut:** Liu, also known as HeavenDuke, also founded the Chinese Science Fiction Database. This is a hilariously bizarre story. Each section gets weirder and weirder (even the tequila gets a POV), and the larger premise is just strange. This might be one of the few stories where I really question Shurin’s inclusion, as it’s good, but I’m having a harder time seeing it as cyberpunk.

* **fanny:** This story is very experimental and I am not sure I liked it. The cyberbar is a construct that evolves through the story, and I mean that literally. The concept of cyberbar seems to take technology and amoebas and mix them together. I like seeing this element come into cyberpunk. There is so much that can be done. This story shows that.

That’s it for this week! Check back the same time next week where we’ll be starting a new section in the Big Book and reading and discussing ""Coming Attraction"" by Fritz Leiber, ""With the Original Cast"" by Nancy Kress, ""Dogfight"" by William Gibson & Michael Swanwick, and ""Glass Reptile Breakout"" by Russell Blackford.

1712039870.0,"""The Curse of the Mistwraith"" and the joy of re-reading"," So, I've not posted from this account in like 5 years, and there's been a simple and sad reason: I haven't really been reading, and r/fantasy is where I usually post, so there's been nothing to report. The pandemic really fucked my attention span and motivation to read, and it's taken a long time to claw some of it back. But I've been getting through more lately, including a lovely time reading through the first few arcs of *Sandman* again. 

And then I saw that Janny Wurts' ""Song of the Mysteries,"" last book in *Wars of Light and Shadow*, is coming out this year. And, well, these books are my shit. I *adore* this series, am if anything a repetitively ardent advocate for them, and consider them easily the most dramatically under-read and under-appreciated epic fantasy series, full stop. So, time to see how quickly I can re-read all 9 previous installments, to catch up for the release of the conclusion. 

Have you ever had a moment of ""oh, yeah, *this* is why reading is such a magical part of my life?"" I'm halfway through ""Curse of the Mistwraith,"" book 1, and feel my fantasy nerd blood pumping properly for the first time in years. Everything that grabbed me on my first read almost a decade ago is grabbing me again, but with the added joy that this is a series that profoundly rewards re-reading. I'm picking up on hints and foreshadowings of what I know is it to come, with a kind of excited perplexity like ""we hinted at this all they way back *here*? That's setting up for the *sixth*  book!"" and a superior sense of dramatic irony like ""I know exactly what seeds this is sowing, but the characters don't"" 

The worldbuilding, plot and characterisation are even deeper in this kind of retrospect. Every character, narrative element and setting reminds me of what I know is to come, and makes me excited to read through all the build ups and climaxes over again. And even more excited to follow the threads all the way to the conclusion this time! 

If you're not familiar with *Wars of Light and Shadow*, and you like dense, ambitious fantasy storytelling but doesn't hold your hand but gives you all the tools to reward your close attention, now is a great time to give it a shot. And I'd love to hear what other series you find as rewarding and enlightening on a re-read - I want to keep the spark re-kindled!",Fantasy
1712032400.0,Looking for a very niche genre,"So I'm watching Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters. It's mostly mediocre, but it has some good ass vibes. But vibes alone don't really scratch the itch. I want something that feels low fanasy but where all the protagonists dress like they're D&D characters and use revolvers and shit in a setting that feels a couple hundred years too early.

Van Helsing is the best example of this. The Innistrad set of Magic: The Gathering is another one.

I'm primarily looking for movies, but since this doesn't really seem to be a popular enough genre I'll try to get back into audiobooks. Ideally with female protagonists because I feel like this movie would be better without Jeremy Renner.

I feel like this isn't really ""steampunk"" but it does have that kind of vibe. I'm not sure I've ever really seen a ""steampunk"" movie, and once again Van Helsing seems to come the closest.",Fantasy

1712024423.0,Recommendations for big universes expanded across several books,"(TLDR at the bottom)

As the title says, please point for me those histories that expand across several long books.

I have read and liked these:

* The Realm of The Elderlings 
* The Demon Cycle
* The Books of Elan (minus The Rise And Fall, since there's no audiobook yet)

These are smaller, but they were also good:
* Daevabad Trilogy 
* The Silo Saga
* Wayward Pines

I have tried going for *The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo*, but it took too long for anything to happen, so I dropped it. Some reviews said it is very good after de first 1/3, so I am trying to muster the courage to try it again.

Also tried Raymond E. Feist *Magician*, but somehow hated it. I don't know why, really. At first, I thought it was the change in perspective from Pug to Thomas, but other books also have shift in perspectives, and they did just fine. A shame, really. 

*Red Rising* and *Eden Paradox* were also good, but I would rather have magic instead of technology.

*Helldivers* is also good, but I'm waiting for the series to finish, as I like to binge-listen to books while working.

*Game of Thrones* seems interesting, but at the bottom of my list since there is little to no magic. (If I'm mistaken, please correct me)

*Lord of The Rings* is out of question. I do know that the books are supposed to be better than the movies, but yet, I can't bring myself to do it.

I tried *The Witcher*, and it is indeed good, but the app I use only has it in brazilian portuguese, and I like audiobooks in english. (I'm brazilian, btw)

Having that in mind, would you please recommend any book series that fit in those descriptions.

TL;DR: One universe told by several books. Something like *The Realm of The Elderlings* or *The Books of Elan* would be perfect.",Fantasy

* You can track your current/past reads and your TBR on separate sheets. On those sheets, note what bingo categories books fit under. (Note: bingo categories must be written the *exact* same way every time. Yes, this is a pain.)
* Based on that info, the Bingo planner sheet creates dropdowns that will offer options from both your reading log and TBR.
* The Bingo Card sheet will automatically fill in your card. You can choose to see a text-only card or a visual one.
* It supports up to 4 cards if you use the Bingo - Multi sheets. (As long as I didn't break anything setting that up.)
* You can update it when a new bingo period rolls around, if you want to keep using the same file.
* You can customize the reading log to track additional data; my own tracker has extra columns for tracking things like wordcount, whether I owned or borrowed the book, etc.

More instructions are inside. Please enjoy this humble spreadsheet offering. u/shift_shaper, thank you for creating such an awesome, useful bingo spreadsheet and for inspiring me to improve my Excel skills and be creative. and u/happy_book_bee, thank you for another exciting bingo!

PS: The example data is just for example based on some of last year's reads; I make no promises as to the accuracy of bingo categories.

PPS: You'll probably get an alert about external data if you make a copy of the sheet. As far as I can tell, that's just a result of pulling in the cover images via the goodreads image url.",Fantasy
1712010032.0,Sarum ,"I think that Sarum by Edward Rutherfurd probably slots into fantasy to some degree - it’s concerned with the history and anthropology of the generations of people who lived in Stonehenge. I just wanted to share my thoughts (which are disappointment). The historical epic is my favorite genre. And I appreciated that he stars the story in Neolithic times. But that brings me to my concern…

It’s such a patriarchal book. Spoiler alert, the main characters are men. Women only exist as sex objects or childbearers and their only relationships revolve around these topics, plus sexual and romantic jealousy of other women. I was so so disappointed. It’s not just the erasure, I feel like you can’t tell a truly gripping story about the past without theorizing how the past humans related to other humans (and why!), and it feels like the entire book glosses this over. One caveat is that I know in the past (1987) history was not exactly taught in a way that would facilitate thinking about women’s existence or gender as having roles. 

I’m not calling out Rutherfurd- I swear I can understand how the historical research would be the issue. It just struck me as CRAZY to think about a narrative structured this way.",Fantasy

1712009181.0,[SPFBO 9 Review] The Wickwire Watch by Jacquelyn Hagen,"“TRUST NO ONE. It's the first and greatest rule Inkwell Featherfield ever learned. It's also the only way he knows how to survive—besides picking pockets, dodging the law, and using every ounce of his plucky charm. But none of this will be enough to save him now. If only he'd never snooped around a dead man's house. If only he'd never found that pocket watch full of strange magic. If only he'd known the old man had snuffed it at the hands of the ghostly Spektors, or that such dark spirits even existed, because now they're after him.”

The Wickwire Watch has a very strong opening with an imaginative world that draws the reader into the pages. There is a lot for every reader with the different characters, mysterious plot, and unique world. This will be the start to a much longer series which means there is a certain amount of set up within the book. There are some issues that I had with the book particularly with the pacing in the middle which slowed down the plot and decreased my enjoyment.

**So what worked for me?**

Worldbuilding: The world of Wickwire is very imaginative and the author does a very good job of bringing the world to life. It was very easy for me to believe that events could happen in this world and how these characters would react. I really enjoyed the Spektors and how spooky they were. I love a good ghostly mystery. The beginning and the end of this book were especially strong in my opinion. The end does lend for a binging straight into book 2 which is good for binge readers in the crowd.

**What did not work for me?**

Plot: The main issue I had with this book would be that it really slowed down in the middle of the book. This also lowered my enjoyment and lost some interest with the plot. While I sometimes don’t mind a slower plot if I can connect with the characters or learn about the world. Unfortunately for this one the middle was a slow down for all aspects of the story. However, the beginning and the end were very intriguing to read. The other issue is wholly a me issue where not enough was in the first book for me to want to commit to a longer series aka there was a lot of set up.

**Recommendation?**

This was an very well written spooky mystery story. There are very unique elements with the worldbuilding and there are definitely larger political implications for later in the series. This looks like a good series that will turn from a spooky mystery to an epic political fantasy in a cool steampunky world. This series is very bingable and for the intrigue driven reader.

1712003276.0,"Furies of Calderan -- Combat, combat, combat.","I'm reading the Furies of Calderan for the first time, and while I do enjoy it generally speaking there's one thing that nags at me consistently and I'd love to hear what others think. The series itself is not terribly long, the books I can cruise through relatively quickly so I understand how the author tried to force plot movement into every moment. I'm on book three and I've begun to expect and even laugh at the recurring trope of nearly every scene not being able to go without some form of combat or action happening. Book 2 is rife with this and book 3 is shaping up to be exactly the same. We nearly can't have a scene begin peacefully and end peacefully it would seem. I've never seen a book with more danger and combat packed into it, and I wouldn't mind except that I don't think the author is particularly skilled at actually writing combat.  
For instance, there's a scene in book two where the queen Vord is fighting Sir Miles, arguably two of the fastest moving creatures ever, and it takes two sentences to describe a single action of the queen grabbing Tavi as he thrusts a spear, and then throws him using it. (My mind instantly conjured various ways to write this eloquently into a single smooth sentence.) When fast-paced combat is described sluggishly it is jarring, it doesn't convey the breakneck speed of the fighters, and instead forces you to read and then go back in your mind to try to imagine it, instead of the writing smoothly putting that image into your mind.  
Perhaps I'm just not fit for books that are constantly full of combat, I like a bit of intrigue, I like interpersonal development, intellectual queries, and non-combat based world building narratives. If this keeps up I might just have to put the series down.",Fantasy

1711997807.0,Is anyone else conflicted about the Tearling Series (Erika Johansen)?,"I know this is an older book, but I recently finished the Tearling series and I found myself struggling with my thoughts on the books and wanted to see if other readers had similar conflicting views. I, unlike it seems a lot of other readers, don’t have a massive issue with the ending. I do think on a worldbuilding and character level it’s co-out and annoying but on a thematic level, I get it. But I still have issues with the way that theme comes across (or even if Johansen actually intends that theme)

I think the theme is supposed to be…idealization of an individual only harms the message they’re trying to endorse. This theme is emphasized to me by the ending of the books in two ways. First, the fact that Katie has to realize that it was wrong to idealize the Tears and that the good ending for the Tearling is when the family’s legacy is essentially erased. Second, Kelsea also has to ‘erase’ her idealized legacy (the ‘Glynn queen’ seen in the chapter epigraphs, which I think are supposed to be from the hypothetical timeline where Katie&Kelsea don’t do the thing) for the Tearling to truly become a Utopia. 

However, I can’t for the life of me decide if Johnson thinks that idealization is wrong because even the most perfect person’s message will get corrupted or because no one is truly ideal.  

Basically…are Tear and Kelsea supposed to be paragons of viture? Or are they supposed to be flawed? Like from my read, Tear and Kelsea both have major personality flaws (Tear more so) but it seems like the narrative sometimes treats them are like perfect people whose few mistakes are not even really their fault.

Looking at all the Katie chapters is seems to be dealing with this idea. They mainly focus on Tear’s “flaws” such as going back to get the medics only when his wife is the one in danger and forming a literal secret police. However, Katie’s narration is always quick to provide justifications, that his love with Lily is so true it overcomes his morals or that he needs to protect his family. I can see a reading of Katie being an unreliable narrator who needs to learn Tear is flawed, especially with the way the ending goes but I don’t think it’s done well if that even is the main intention. 

However, I think the main thing that causes my conflict is everything with Rowland. Without any of the Rowland stuff, honestly Kelsea and Tear come mostly across as good-intentioned but realistically flawed human beings and it would make the theme of “don’t idealize people because even the best person is still just a person with flaws” make sense. 

However, the Rowland stuff is completely out of line for Tear and doesn’t even make sense with the rest of his characterization. I don’t understand why, in-universe, Tear made the choices he did. The whole move seems like the actions of one of the Gilead-esque men from Lily’s backstory.  I think it’s supposed to be because he ‘knows’ Row is evil…but that’s just BS and even an idiot would realize that raising him the way he did is only going to make the situation worse. Like why couldn’t Tear acknowledge Row, and him and Lily co-parent with Mrs. Finn? This is supposed to be an equal progressive utopia that he’s building. What’s worse is, with Rowland situation, the last we get on the subject is Tear himself saying that Rowland’s mother was weak and Rowland was manipulative.  Which is hella victum-blame-y makes Tear look even worse that even in death he doesn’t see any problem with how he treated the Finns. It shifts him from “good person with normal human flaws” to “literal monster”. 

But then I think I’m reading way more into this than I should be? Like, my main gripe with ACTOAR is that it has Feyre and Rhys are clearly flawed protagonists who the narrative insists are perfect and I know SJM isn’t doing that on purpose.  

Also, I want to set the baseline that overall the worldbuilding is a complete mess, which might be coloring my view of the characters and themes and my distrust of Johanson's ability to write a complex theme. Plot holes galore. For example, in the first book, it’s made pretty clear that the different countries were founded by different groups from the OG earth (with Kelsea noting at one point the the American-British group had “choosen a poor landing site”)…with the reveals in the later books this is impossible unless those other groups also had their own magical Tear-figures? The two “non-white” coded countries are little more than one-dimensional caricatures which have no narrative reason to exist which is a trope I thought we left behind by now. The idea of magic being innate to land and reactivating in people from the crossing is cool, but it’s poorly integrated into the culture of the world. Like I could not really tell you if magic is commonly accepted or not? I think the church doesn’t like it? But no more than the real world Church doesn’t like it. It’s not just that nothing holds up to heavy scrutiny (which I can accept, a lot of genre YA has more thematic worldbuilding to drive a message), but it invites scrutiny into it’s plot holes.

**TLDR: Is Queen of the Tearling actually doing something very clever with unreliable narrators to highlight that idealizing people is wrong or am I just ""the curtains are blue""-ing my way into craziness?**",Fantasy

(I'm late! But this Bingo card doesn't count officially anyhow.)

Our house goes through an astronomical number of middle grade graphic novels to fuel our book-loving kids. I'm truly blown away by how amazing this genre has exploded since my time as a child. It's perfect for such a wide age range because pre-literate kids can follow along easily with the pictures and there are so many great authors/illustrators in the space now that it is easy to find diverse characters and topics.

I thought it would be fun to see if I could fill in a bingo card over the past year with what we've read - turns out I probably could have filled out multiple cards when all was said and done. Of course, a middle grade graphic novel is often not even novella length, but I tried to find books that fit the spirit of the squares as best I could or we ended up reading lots of books within the same series. For example, I used the Korgi books for the novella square, since these have practically no text at all. As I mentioned, this doesn't count, nor did I turn it in officially, so we've got a lot of wiggle room with the rules...

I was personally most impressed by Batcat, Bea Wolf, and Wynd. The Bunnicula graphic novel was an excellent and highly nostalgic read for me too. And I was psyched to finally read Bone (was my first time reading it too). We only struggled to find something for the Middle East square - that is, I found plenty of books but the kids were very uninterested for one reason or another until we hit on the trusty Magic Tree House series (the first books now all have graphic novel adaptations as well).

Basically, I just want to share how much I love this space - I have so many more recommendations if you have kids. Plus, I highly recommend them as great palate cleansers for all ages in between more literary pursuits too ;)",Fantasy

1711991580.0,How BrandoSando Sparked a Love of Reading in Me (or: You Can Teach an Old Dog New Tricks)," 

This is a long post but I've been wanting to put these thoughts into words for a while.

This post describes what Brandon Sanderson has meant to me. To understand it, you have to know what kind of reader (if you could call me that) I was for all of my life leading up to June 2023. Currently, I'm 42 years old. From the time I graduated high school to last summer, I probably averaged reading less than 1 book per year (reading for enjoyment, obviously doesn't include textbooks and such). And anything I did read was never fiction.

I always wanted to read more, but anytime I tried to pick up a novel it never hooked me. My life is littered with quarter-to-half-read books. I remember one time I picked up a copy of Infinite Jest because I had read something about it in an article and heard how difficult a read it is. I wanted to challenge myself (at least that's what I told myself). I got through about 200 pages of it and was impressed I read that much. Looking back I think this was a microcosm of all of my attempts to read. I was choosing books that I thought I *should* want to read, instead of what I would actually enjoy reading. It was a very egotistical approach. I wanted to read things that would impress others.

The problem was that it was always a slog. Reading constantly felt like a chore. I had heard people talking about visualizing the text and painting a picture in their mind while they read. This never happened to me and I assumed it was just something I could not do.

Fast forward to June of last year. A Mormon colleague of mine was telling me about Sanderson and I looked into him. I never really thought about picking up a fantasy book, but I like fantasy in other types of media (and sci-fi too) and figured I would give him a shot. I ordered Mistorn and it hooked me almost immediately. I think it was the world-building that drew me into it. It was like a lightbulb had turned on in me. I was actually visualizing what I was reading. Nothing felt difficult and I had the urge to pick it up again and again.

I still distinctly remember the part that completely hooked me. It was a twist with about 200 pages to go in the book. Spoiler: >!It was when the assassination team was going to kill Elend and Vin was trying to stop them. When you find out the Mistborn leader of the team was Shan Elariel.!< From that point, I couldn't put the book down and finished it that day. It's hard to describe the feeling of satisfaction after I finished that first book. It was a mix of pride that I had done it, a sense of awe that it had captured me as it did, and a newly found understanding of why people read.

After that first book, I burned through the rest of Mistborn Era 1 and had my sights on The Way of Kings. It was certainly intimidating but I dove into it and loved it even more than Mistborn. I finished it and went right into Words of Radiance and had the same experience. By this point, I had been doing a lot of research and reading (mostly on Reddit) about the fantasy and sci-fi genres and had compiled a long list of other authors and books I wanted to read. I wanted to see what else was out there and I was worried it was just Sanderson that could capture my attention. I plan to go back to Stormlight Archive soon, but my newly found love of reading has opened me up to so much.

My hobby is now reading. It's about the only thing I want to do in my personal free time. From June 2023 to the end of 2023, I read 35 books. I'm now consistently reading 9-10 books each month. I can't believe it. I remember hearing people talk about reading 52 books in a year and that always seemed like such a ridiculous number. Now I'll probably read that in half of this year.

I don't know if I can say right now that Sanderson is my favorite author. But I'll always have a special place in my heart for him for sparking my joy in reading. The biggest thing I've learned from this is you just have to find what interests you. It seems so simple to say now. I do think that Mistborn was the perfect book for me to get started on. The worldbuilding matched with his ability to finish a book was just what I needed and was the perfect reward for the time I spent reading it.",Fantasy

I read the first chapter and didn't like it, but I decided to keep reading since it was just the first chapter. Kept reading and didn't get any better, the story didn't engage me and I felt the chapters INFINITE (even though each has like 10 pages), unlike with HP, in which every chapter I wanted to read more or to know what will happen next. I also can't stand Riordan's writing, I don't know, it's just I can't bear it!

1711989085.0,Book Bingo Themes 2024,"I love hearing about the different themes people do and how it goes! Last year I tried a climate-fiction theme. Definitely had to stretch a few squares into ""features nature"" 😅. I hope to revisit this theme in a future year after giving the genre some time to evolve, but this year I thought I'd go with something... more flexible - perhaps Languages, which could feature conlangs, linguists, bilingual characters/texts, books in translation... open to suggestions! 

Either that or maybe an animal theme - each book features a different animal, mythical or real 🤔

How about you all, if you did a theme last year, how did it work out? Have you picked a theme this year or are you as indecisive as me? ",Fantasy
1711988757.0,"Bingo Mini Review: (Frequently) Normal Mode, but still completed","This year was super busy for me, so I ended up not doing hard mode and using alot more books I would have read anyway rather than limiting myself to books read for bingo. But hey I still managed to get through it and as always, am glad I did. (is this really my 4th bingo? I don't believe it).

On to the Mini Reviews:

**Title With a Title: Master of Sorrows by Justin T Call 4/5\* (hard mode)**

Epic Fantasy with a slow burn dark chosen one corruption story line.  In many ways there's nothing particularly great to point to — the characters are fine but nothing special, the world feels typical epic fantasy, the plot feels mostly typical except for the dark chosen one inversion. But it's all very well executed and maybe it's my love of corruption arcs and my inability to find many of them, but I'm loving this series and can't wait for the third book.  This was my first read for bingo and an excellent find. Thank you to whoever suggested it.

**Superheroes: Dreadnaught by April Daniels 3/5\* (hard mode)**

A trans girl gets superpowers giving her the body that matches her identity, but that doesn't make her problems go away, there's still transphobia and super villains to deal with. I both enjoyed this book and was incredibly disappointed  by it. It keeps almost diving into something interesting, but then I feel ends up shallowly skipping over it — eg >!before reading it I'd been told how well done the realizing presenting as a girl will suddenly make her deal with sexism, but this only is shown through her best friend, and only last a page or so before the best friend is never thought of again, despite how close they previously seen, and there doesn't seem to be any other sexism she experiences. !< or (spoiler for the second book) >!the incredibly transphobic superhero is actually also a traditionally evil supervillain. I think it entirely corrupts the message of people can be complex, an otherwise good superhero dedicated to saving lives who spews hate and transphobia is much more interesting to me!<

**Bottom of the TBR: White Sand by Brandon Sanderson 3/5\***

I don't actually keep a TBR making this a more difficult square, but then I realized this was  the only published Sanderson book I hadn't read because I don't like graphic novels/audio books. So for the sake of Bingo (and my desire to meet Khriss, and some other Cosmere things) I listened to the audio book. It was fine. Khriss was dissapointing. It was entertaining enough to keep listening to I guess, but not really something I""ll be recommending.

**Magical Realism of Literary Fantasy: Bunny by Mona Awad 3/5\* (hard mode)**

Another dissapointing one. The book was not weird enough for a book that relied on being weird. Which made it kinda boring? It started interesting and the prose is great, but overall not enough happened and I was fairly bored. If you want weird dark academia just read Vita Nostra, it's worlds better.

**Young Adult: Dark Heir by C.S. Pacat (hard mode) 5/5\***

I absolutely love this series. Angst done in all the right rather than annoying ways. Fantasy London, playing with chosen one tropes, some past lives/resurrection stuff. At this point I'm pretty sure I'll read whatever Pacat writes. (Except graphic novels, I still don't like graphic novels, hence why I haven't read Fence). I was having trouble deciding which of the YA books I'd read to use for this square (I wanted to not do a sequel, but alas have read so few non-sequels recently)

**Mundane Jobs: The Dragon's Banker by Scott Warren 4/5\* (hard mode)**

This was fun lighthearted fantasy. Don't remember it that well but I did enjoy it.

**Published in the 00's: Issola (Vlad Taltos series) by Steven Brust 4/5\* (hard mode)**

My reread square. Excellent second world urban fantasy. Long running series so I knew at least one of them was published in the 00's. And I think Issola is also one of my favorites if the series.  Looking forward to the newest book coming out later this month!

**Angels and Demons: Chain of Gold by Cassandra Clare 3/5\* (normal mode)**

It's been a really long time since I read any Mortal Instrument Books. I'm probably enjoying her newest series more for nostalgia then for the book itself.

**Five Short Stories: Dying With Her Cheer Pants On: Stories of the Fighting Pumpkins by Seanan McGuire (hm) 4/5\***

In true Seanan McGuire fashion this was alot of fun. Some satire on horrible things happening in fantasy high schools (feels like its poking fun at Buffy and the like).

**Horror: Mister Magic by Kiersten White 3/5\* (hard mode)**

I keep trying Kiersten White's new books because of how much I love And I Darken, but I haven't found any  others that are great. This book had its moments and has some great themes, but it's not horror-y enough for a horror book for me.

**Self-Published or Indie Author: Esrahadon by Michael J Sullivan 4/5\* (easy mode)**

My favorite of my least favorite Sullivan Series. I love Riyria and Legends of the First Empire but I've generally found Rise and Fall pretty boring. It's cool to get more Elan info but generally I haven't cared about the characters and plots on their own. This one differs in that I really did like Esra as a character, but it still didn't reach the level of Riyria/Legends.

**Set in the Middle East: Exordia by Seth Dickinson 4/5\* (normal mode)**

I love Seth Dickinson. Traitor Baru Cormorant is my favorite fantasy book. This book is definitely Seth Dickinson...except clearly not written for me. I'm not a fan of military science fiction, and this had too much of that. And while I loved one of the pov characters, I hated another, and found the rest just bland. The prose was still beautiful, but prose is more a cherry on top for me than something I read for.

(Also as I write this I just started a book that would have been a much better fit for middle east as it seems like it'll spend most of the book in Israel from an Israeli pov rather than just some of the book in Kurdistan from a US military pov, but I suspect I will not finish it in the day before bingo ends)

**Published in 2023: Never a Hero by Vanessa Lim 5/5\* (easy mode)**

I'm really enjoying this series. It's so much fun. I had no idea you could make an anti-hero feel like such a good person, and yet still undeniably be an anti-hero? I also love when books show me that tropes I don't tend to like can just be executed so well, in this case the love triangle. It's less about the pining and more about her sorta figuring out who she wants to be. Also a rare occurrence of I don't actually know who she'll end up with. Great series.

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities: War of the Givens by Daniel Price 4/5\* (hard mode)**

sqee! I still can't believe this book was released. I'd given up on it as an unfinished series after the release date had been pushed multiple times over the last 7 years. If a group of people being transported to an alternate earth and all gaining time related abilities sounds like fun...it it. Although I recommend not thinking about how the time-stuff/multi-verse stuff works to hard, it's a very enjoyable series and I love seeing where all the characters ended up. While the timeskip made me feel I missed out on some great character moments, I really enjoyed it and found it to be a mostly fitting ending.

**PoC Author: Those Beyond the Wall by Micaiah Johnson 4/5\* (hard mode)**

Space Between Worlds is a lovely sci-fi book and didn't need a sequel, but I'm so glad I got one as I love spending time in this world(s). And its neat to see the characters from a different perspective. The ending didn't work for me, (a little too...pat? if that's the right word), but the rest of the book more than made up for that.

~~Bookclub/Readalong:~~  **Nonfiction: New Worlds Year Six by Marie Brennan (hard mode? can substitution still be hard mode?)**

Continuing a tradition of using my substitution to read a square I previously subbed out..., nonfiction isn't generally my jam but I do generally enjoy this worldbuilding series.

Separately I'm sad I didn't do any of the bookclub's this year (aside from some of the awesome new shortfic bookclub readings, but I don't think that counts since it's not a novel or collection?)

**Novella: Montego by Brian Mcclellan 4/5\***

This was a fun read. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hadn't read the main novel (Glass Immortals) but if you liked that then the novella is a fun backstory for Montego. Seperately does anyone else feel Montego is just Bo transported from Brian's powdermage series to his glass immortals series?

**Mythical Beasts: Cage of Dreams by Rebecca Schaeffer 5/5\*** (I think normal mode? Dragons probably do exist even if I don't recall seeing any, pretty sure a serpent was at least mentioned)

My only complaint is I want a third book in this series. This is such a delightful urban fantasy in a gotham inspired city where people turn into their nightmares when they sleep. (often mythical beast) The mc has a bunch of phobias and this is super well portrayed and I also love the relationship with her best friend. After how much I loved Market of Monsters, this series very much cemented Rebecca Schaeffer as one of my favorite authors.

Sidenote: I did not realize how difficult it was going to be to find a book without dragons, even books not centering on dragons still seem to have them exist. I guess I could have used a vampire book but that doesn't feel like its in the spirit of ""beast.""

**Elemental Magic: Path of Darkness by CM Lacknerr. 4/5\* (hard mode)**

I love alot of villain mc (if you can't tell) and this one is great. Her motives are believable and the books alot of fun. The magic's nothing special, but eh I didn't expect it to be given the square. I do find the gods intriguing.

**Myths and Retellings: He Who Drowned the World 5/5\* (hard mode)**

Again, villain mc's are great. I'm also a fan of historical fantasy retellings. A great conclusion to a great series. I did a longer review for this one in its own post

**Queernorm Setting: Labyrinths Heart 4/5\* (hard mode)**

Great conclusion to a great series. Smart characters, themes of fantasy, and well done fantasy city, cool magic. I always feel like I should enjoy this one more than I do as it has so much I love in a fantasy series, but still really do like it.

**Coastal or Island Setting:  Bone Shard War 4/5\* (hard mode?** not sure if there's enough sea-faring to count but there's some**)**

The third was my least favorite in the series, though I still enjoyed it, I think the timeskip didn't quite work for me. Fun epic fantasy, lots of threads coming together. I'm curious if other people would have counted this for the robots/automaton square...

**Druids: Weaver and the Witch Queen 4/5\* (hard mode)**

My favorite book of last year might've been The Witch's Heart so I was incredibly excited for the authors newest book, but while I enjoyed it it didn't have the same emotional pull. Lots of fun characters and well done, but yeah, it didn't feel like it had as much heart.

**Featuring Robots: System Collapse by Martha Wells 4/5\* (normal mode)**

I'm always going to enjoy reading Murderbot, it's point of view is cozy and the stories are fun. This is true even if I don't find the more recent books to be as good as the first few. (but i still liked this one better than the novel). I had been hoping to find a hard mode book rather than taking the easy way out and just counting murderbot which I was going to read anyway but oh well.

**Sequel: Beware of Chicken 3 by CasualFarmer 4/5\* (hard mode)**

This is a fun cosyfantasy series satirizing alot of genre. The books worked really well as palate cleansers between dark reads for me. (Sidenote I'd initially read this for multiverse square before War of the Givens came out)",Fantasy
1711988411.0,Discworld fans- help me out please!,"

A while back I picked up the first ""science of discworld"" book mistakenly thinking it was the first actual discworld book, I read the first chapter & loved it so much, then I read the next chapter & was a little confused because it seemed to be talking about actual science, I kept reading a few more chapters & still really loved it ecspecially the discworld chapters& I realized it wasnt actually the first discworld book but still read it & really enjoyed it alot. 

 I later got the correct first book Color of Magic but I wasnt able to get far into it with alot of busy things happening. A few moths later I tried to listen to it on audiobook. I thought it was- fine? It was good but it just didnt grab me all that much. Ive since tried the guards guards! & wyrd sisters on audio & its the same thing, like theyre fine, there is some funny parts but all together the story just didnt like grab me somehow....

I cant really figure out what the issue is. Maybe it's the audiobook specifically that is just not connecting with me? I know alot of people love the audiobook versions though so i'm just not sure? Maybe I just like the charachters & humour in the Science of Discworld more? Is there any other discworld books that follow any of those characters or take place at the unseen university with a similar style of humor? Or is there another reason anyone can think that id like the science ones so much more?

Is there an actual discworld anyone would reccommend me to try if I enjoyed the science of discworld the most so far?

1711983383.0,Interactive Bingo Card 2024,"Here is the updated version of my bingo card for 2024. As in previous years, it supports hard mode and creation of a visual card/darkmode visual card (based on [u/CoffeeArchives](https://www.reddit.com/u/CoffeeArchives/) design).

u/happy_book_bee feel free to link this in your resources.

It is built in Google Sheets. Unfortunately, if you copy or export it to Excel, several of the formulas will stop working, as they don't transfer over well.

Same as last year, you will be able to track up to 25 different cards at once using the same Book Log. Instructions are in the sheet, but basically, copying the existing Bingo Card tab, renaming it, and refreshing the data using the checkbox on the instructions page will allow you to create multiple cards at once.

The cards will automatically warn you if you are trying to use the same book on multiple cards, even if it is only used once per card. It does not currently provide the same warning about authors.

There is still only one set of visual cards. To switch which tracking card is displayed visually, there is a dropdown just below the Gandalf Snoo on each card.

**New this year:** On the Book Log, there are 5 columns after the grid of bingo squares for you to track card themes that a book fits into. On each bingo card, there is a dropdown at the bottom (kind of hidden when it is blank, look for the small gray arrow) that lets you select a theme for the card from the five on the log. The card will limit the books in the dropdowns to books that fit that theme.

I have re-indexed the books in the book log so that the sheet can differentiate between books with the same title by different authors (Looking at you City of Bones by Cassandra Clare and Martha Wells). As a result, on the Bingo Card(s) each title is preceded by its row number on the book log. This row number won't show up on the Visual Card.

I added an additional Visual Card option based on the types of cards I see people showing off. Visual Card (Condensed) offers an aesthetic without the extra frills. It displays only book covers in a grid, no category/title/author.

 Let me know if you run into problems or if something doesn't seem to be working right/how you expect it to. As always, please let me know if you have questions or suggestions for improvement. 

 To play around with the card, go here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fws7YSDDnECeijG8y9CNII-dCy4KovxUvGotE\_xNxew/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fws7YSDDnECeijG8y9CNII-dCy4KovxUvGotE_xNxew/)

1711982386.0,Book Review: Empire of the Damned by Jay Kristoff,"**TL;DR Review:** Bloody, brutal, and spectacular. Insanely action-packed with highly addictive characters and a gothic world that just keeps getting darker and more intriguing. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjfnghwiqvrc1.jpg?width=658&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=feb35657e063de8ae28d7310f28560ca5f6968de

# Full Review: 

Fuck my face. 

*Empire of the Vampire* was a revelation last year, a book I had no idea would be so good but ended up rating as one of the best of 2023.

Knowing that, I went into *Empire of the Damned* with high expectations—and still wasn’t prepared for how bloody spectacular it was. 

*Empire of the Vampire* set up this very interesting format to present the story: current-day Gabriel de Leon is a prisoner being interrogated by a vampire historian, and he gives us a recounting of events as he recalled them. However, as we learn in *Empire of the Damned,* he is an incredibly unreliable narrator, one whose memories of events and details are highly colored by his nature (arrogant, wrathful, drunkard). 

The fact that it’s a recounting makes it easy to “break the fourth wall” because he can switch from narrating events to explaining some interesting minutia or shooting some sarcastic remark to his interrogator. It also adds an immense amount of color to every moment, because the entire story is flavored by his particular brand of irreverent arsehole. 

*Empire of the Damned* picks up where *Empire of the Vampire* left off, following Gabriel in his journeys with Dior Lachance, the Holy Grail of San Michon, the one who will banish the “daysdeath” eternal night and bring back the sun to kill off all the vampires. 

There’s just one problem: he’s just finished killing off all his fellow silversaints and is instead traveling with his *very* hate-filled vampire sister (who saved his life in Book 1). What could go wrong, right?

EVERYTHING. 

That seems to be the Jay Kristoff motto. Whatever he can make worse, he will—and FAR worse than you could possibly expect. 

Time and again, I was blown away by just how *dark* the story went. Just when it looks like there’s a bright spot of hope, a happy moment for a character, or a possible break in the fruitless hunt for sanctuary and answers, NOPE! The rug gets ripped out from under the characters—and often their legs right along with it. 

To say I was enthralled by this story is an understatement. Late nights, early mornings, snatches of reading standing in line at the bank or walking down the street—I burned through this book in my every spare moment because I *had* to know what was coming next and just how he was going to make life even bloodier and more miserable for the characters.

Be warned: this book is not for the faint of heart. All the misery, death, gore, and suffering from Book 1 are dialed up ALL THE NOTCHES in the sequel. Where Book 1 showed you only the aftermath of the vampires’ conquest—the foulboods (zombies), the corpses, the burned-out villages, the children turned to undead and feeding on their parents and siblings—Book 2 takes you into the heart of the vampires’ lair, into a veritable feast of blood and death. 

If you are squeamish about violence and gore, this is not the book for you. But if you’re willing to grit your teeth and bear with it, you are in for a truly wild ride that will have you ripping through the pages at full speed to get to that heart-breaking, soul-crushing, and truly spectacular ending.

*Title without Title (HM)*

**Paladin's Grace** by **T.Kingfisher**, 4 stars

I’ve read two out of three sequels already, so it’s clearly a favorite, and I do recommend them a lot… But I still don’t enjoy the romances in this series. Everything else is wonderful, I love the world, and the story, and most of the characters, and T.Kingfisher’s delicious occasional creepiness. Just not the constant self-deprecation of the protagonists, it’s exhausting and got old in chapter 1 of book 1.

.

*Superheroes (HM)*

**Steelheart** by **Brandon Sanderson**, 3 stars

As my heart belongs to Marvel comics and I *hate* the deconstruction that’s been trying to happen in this genre for a while now, my only option for the HM was Sanderson. To nobody’s surprise I didn’t enjoy this book.

.

*Bottom of the TBR (HM)*

**Evensong's Heir** by **L.S. Baird**, 4.5 stars

It was probably recommended on tumblr circa 2010 and its cover filled the 2023 me with dread, but the writing was so awesome I couldn’t help but love the thing. It’s like Tolkien’s whimsiness that’s both playful and profound meets the yaoi tropes from the 1990s. Is it cursed? Absolutely. Did it make me uncomfortable? Duh. Is it also amazing? One hundred percent yes.

.

*Magical Realism (HM)*

**Moby Dick** by **Herman Melville**, 4.5 stars

I wish I grew up with this book! It’s everything I used to obsess over; a sea adventure with an unreliable narrator and tons of seemingly useless trivia. It’s all vibes, endless dramatic commentary on human condition but almost no plot. There was only one bed.

.

*Young Adult (HM)*

**Hotel Magnifique** by **Emily J. Taylor**, 4 stars

It’s alright, as far as YA goes. It always works for me when a place is a character, and a suspicious teleporting hotel is as good as this trope can get. The story is a bit on the cliché side, with the main character wanting to save her little sister and ending up as a chosen one, but solid. Her love interest is a bisexual guy whose sexuality was handled excellently, IMO.

.

*Mundane Jobs (HM)*

**The Justice of Kings** by **Richard Swan**, 3 stars

For like 80% I was swept by this book, as I tend to adore the discourse of law vs morality, but ended up disappointed. The relationship between the main characters developed in a direction I profoundly disliked and the story turned out to be uninteresting.

.

*Published in the 00s (HM)*

**The Curse of Chalion** by **Lois McMaster Bujold**, 4.5 stars

As usual, I took ½ star away for the romance. Couldn’t the guy have someone closer to his age? Other than that, a great book.

.

*Angels/Demons (HM)*

**Siewca Wiatru** by **Maja Lidia Kossakowska**, 3 stars

Imagine a hardboiled *spetsnaz* novel where the female characters are all called “my little one” by the male characters, but every single one of them is an angel or a demon that fights their eternal war with each other and the unspeakable lovecraftian horror that lurks on the outskirts of the known universe. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a story on the angelic and the demonic where humans don’t matter at all. Weird as heck.

.

*Short Stories (HM)*

**The Devil and the Deep** by **Ellen Datlow**, 4.5 stars

Goodreads thinks it’s a 3.53 out of 5 stars book. I thought this collection was stellar. Every story but the very first one surprised me in a good way, and there’s a ton of fun and weird ideas here.

.

*Horror (HM)*

**The Lesser Dead** by **Christopher Buehlman**, 4 stars

I didn’t love everything about it but will now read everything he writes. The sweet spot between the character writing and the story is not an easy hit for me, and this just works on every level.

.

*Self Published (HM)*

**Letters from a Shipwreck in the Sea of Suns and Moons** by **Raymond St. Elmo**, 4.5 stars

Bertie Wooster meets *Moby Dick* meets *American Gods* meets *The Odyssey*, with a surprisingly wholesome M/F romance in the heart of it. With a sci-fi twist. All these people who keep telling r/fantasy that Raymond St. Elmo is their new favorite author are absolutely right, I’ve already bought a couple more of his works.

.

*Middle East (HM)*

**Gunmetal Gods** by **Zamil Akhtar**, 4 stars

This book is a little bit ungraceful around the edges. As in, it probably could have been written better and become an undisputed king of the genre. Or is it too weird? The plot is structured around a city (that's totally not Istanbul/Constantinople) that keeps changing hands between two factions (totally not Rome and totally not Ottoman empire) and two religions (not!Christianity and not!Islam), but both are based on the memories and interpretations of some very unfriendly lovecraftian “angels”. It is occasionally very grimdark and sometimes too fluffy. The author clearly tries his best to be respectful to the female characters despite the circumstances but it doesn’t always land. I’m considering reading the sequel for the next bingo.

.

*Published in 2023 (HM)*

**Godkiller** by **Hannah Kaner**, 2 stars

Every possible box of inclusivity was checked (and that’s a good thing!) but I thought this book was just dogsh\*t. Bad writing, felt like it was a billion pages long, and the villain and the ending made me regret picking it up.

.

*Multiverse (HM)*

**Nine Princes in Amber** by **Roger Zelazny**, 3 stars

There were a lot of things I liked about it, but I kept thinking, what if it wasn’t a detached unemotional dudebro coolguy book? It could have been *Succession* in a multiverse, but as it is, it was too dry. Maybe it's just me.

.

*POC Author* (HM)

**Lilith's Brood** by **Octavia Butler**, 4.5 stars

Octavia Butler continues to stand undefeated. She makes me uncomfortable and scared in the best way possible, and I dread the day when I’ll run out of her works.

.

Replacing the *Bookclub* square, this is *Lion Squasher (HM, 2021)*

**House of Earth and Blood** by **Sarah J. Maas**\*,\* 3 stars

This is my first Maas ever, and I’ve been told it’s the book with the least amount of sex in it. xD I will not be continuing with the author but I didn’t think this book was *too* bad. It was constantly in a hurry to drop as much exposition as possible, didn’t feel like an adult work at all, and I loved the relationship between the MC’s best friends much more than the main romance, but I understand why these are so popular now.

.

*Novella (HM)*

**I am Legend** by **Richard Matheson,** 3 stars

As it often is with the classics, I found the idea fascinating but the execution didn’t work for me.

.

*Mythical Beasts (HM)*

**The Scar** by **China Miéville**, 4.5 stars

As someone with a MA in Translation I really loved how the main character’s work was described. I don’t enjoy all of Miéville’s books equally but this was one of his best.

.

*Elemental Magic (HM)*

**The Queen of Blood** by **Sarah Beth Durst**, 3 stars

Underwhelming as heck, and its sequel is one of the worst books I’ve read in recent years.

.

*Myths/Retellings (HM)*

**Six Crimson Cranes** by **Elizabeth Lim**, 4 stars

I’m still surprised how much I enjoyed this one. It felt very genuine to me, the stakes were real, and the emotions hit home.

.

*Queernorm (HM)*

**The Empress of Salt and Fortune** by **Nghi Vo**, 4.5 stars

It made me cry. On a beach. A beautiful and cruel work.

.

*Coastal/Island (HM)*

**Earthsea: The First Four Books** by **Ursula LeGuin**, 3.5 stars

*Wizard* was boring. *Tombs* was amazing, and at that point I was glad I picked up the entire collection. *Shore* didn’t blow my mind, and *Tehanu* I hated with a passion because I hated the romance and the change in tone belonged to a different story.

.

*Druids (HM)*

**The Ember Blade** by **Chris Wooding**, 2 stars

When at first you don’t enjoy an author, maybe don’t give him a second chance. What if almost every trope was subverted just to fall on its ass and just play out straight anyway? I’m not even sure this guy understands what an empire is. The only reveal that worked for me was the MC’s father.

.

*Robots (HM)*

**Klara and the Sun** by **Kazuo Ishiguro**, 5 stars

This is pure unadulterated art, made for English majors’ bookclubs. Nobody will come close to fully comprehending it but everyone will have a good time discussing it.

.

*Sequel (HM)*

**God Emperor of Dune** by Frank Hеrbert *(Dune #4),* 4 stars

This is probably my second favorite Dune book. I’m not entirely sure where the author’s opinion falls regarding the multitude of issues presented here, but the discourse was fascinating.",Fantasy

If you are an author on the sub, you may recommend your books as a response to individual squares. This means that you can reply if your book fits in response to any of my comments. But your rec must be in response to another comment, it cannot be a general comment that replies directly to this post explaining all the squares your post counts for. Don't worry, someone else will make a different thread later where you can make that general comment and I will link to it when it is up. This is the one time outside of the Sunday Self-Promo threads where this is okay. To clarify: you can say if you have a book that fits for a square but please don't write a full ad for it. Shorter is sweeter.

1711980145.0,OFFICIAL r/Fantasy 2024 Book Bingo Challenge!,"# WELCOME TO BINGO 2024!

It's a reading challenge, a reading party, a reading marathon, and YOU are welcome to join in on our nonsense!

[r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/) Book Bingo is a yearly reading challenge within our community. Its one-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new authors and books, to boldly go where few readers have gone before . . . (well, many actually because this is the TENTH year of our existence).

**The core of this challenge is encouraging readers to step out of their comfort zones, discover amazing new reads, and motivate everyone to keep up on their reading throughout the year.**

You can find all our past challenges at our [official Bingo wiki page for the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/bingo).

# RULES:

**Time Period and Prize**

* 2024 Bingo Period lasts from April 1st 2024 - March 31st 2025.
* You will be able to turn in your 2024 card in the Official Turn In Post, which will be posted in mid-March 2025. Only submissions through the Google Forms link in the official post will count.
* 'Reading Champion' flair will be assigned to anyone who completes the entire card by the end of the challenge. If you already have this flair, you will receive a roman numeral after 'Reading Champion' indicating the number of times you completed Bingo.

**Repeats and Rereads**

* You can’t use the same book more than once on the card. One square = one book.
* You may not repeat an author on the card EXCEPT: you may reuse an author from the short stories square (as long as you're not using a short story collection from just one author for that square).
* Only ONE square can be a re-read. All other books must be first-time reads. The point of Bingo is to explore new grounds, so get out there and explore books you haven't read before.

**Substitutions**

* You may substitute ONE square from the 2024 card with a square from a previous [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/) bingo card if you wish to. EXCEPTIONS: You may NOT use the Free Space and you may NOT use a square that duplicates another square on this card (ex: you cannot have two 'Goodreads Book of the Month' squares). Previous squares can be found via the [Bingo wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/bingo).

**Upping the Difficulty**

* HARD MODE: For an added challenge, you can choose to do 'Hard Mode' which is the square with something added just to make it a little more difficult. You can do one, some, none, or all squares on 'Hard Mode' -- whatever you want, it's up to you! There are no additional prizes for completing Hard Modes, it's purely a self-driven challenge for those who want to do it.
* HERO MODE: Review EVERY book that you read for bingo. You don't have to review it here on [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy/). It can be on Goodreads, Amazon, your personal blog, some other review site, wherever! Leave a review, not just ratings, even if it's just a few lines of thoughts, that counts. As with Hard Mode there is no special prize for hero mode, just the satisfaction of a job well done.

This is not a hard rule, but I would encourage everyone to post about what you're reading, progress, etc., in at least one of the official [r/Fantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/) monthly book discussion threads that happen on the 30th of each month (except February where it happens on the 28th). Let us know what you think of the books you're reading! The monthly threads are also a goldmine for finding new reading material.

# FAQs

**What Counts?**

* **Can I read non- speculative fiction books for this challenge?** Not unless the square says so specifically. As a speculative fiction sub, we expect all books to be spec fic (fantasy, sci fi, horror, etc.). If you aren't sure what counts, see the next FAQ bullet point.
* **Does ‘x’ book count for ‘y’ square?** Bingo is mostly to challenge yourself and your own reading habit. If you are wondering if something counts or not for a square, ask yourself if you feel confident it should count. You don't need to overthink it. If you aren't confident, you can ask around. If no one else is confident, it's much easier to look for recommendations people are confident will count instead. If you still have questions, free to ask here or in our [Daily Simple Questions threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/search?q=Daily%20Recommendation%20Requests%20and%20Simple%20Questions%20Thread&restrict_sr=1&t=day). Either way, we'll get you your answers.
* **If a self-published book is picked up by a publisher, does it still count as self-published?** Sadly, no. If you read it while it was still solely self-published, then it counts. But once a publisher releases it, it no longer counts.
* **Are we allowed to read books in other languages for the squares?** Absolutely!

**Does it have to be a novel specifically?**

* You can read or listen to any narrative fiction for a square so long as it is at least novella length. This includes short story collections/anthologies, web novels, graphic novels, manga, webtoons, fan fiction, audiobooks, audio dramas, and more.
* If your chosen medium is not roughly novella length, you can also read/listen to multiple entries of the same type (e.g. issues of a comic book or episodes of a podcast) to count it as novella length. Novellas are roughly equivalent to 70-100 print pages or 3-4 hours of audio.

**Timeline**

* **Do I have to start the book from 1st of April 2024 or only finish it from then?** If the book you've started is *less* than 50% complete when April 1st hits, you can count it if you finish it after the 1st.

**Help! I still have questions!**

* Don't worry, we have a [Simple Questions thread every day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/search?q=Daily%20Recommendation%20Requests%20and%20Simple%20Questions%20Thread&restrict_sr=1&t=day) where you can ask for clarifications.

1711976747.0,Romance or Romantasy Book with Good Plot and Writing,"Hi! I've been struggling to read books nowadays because I always feel like most books I read are written in a 'trying hard' manner. I know that the problem is me and I'm not saying that such books are bad because book ratings are subjective. I'm talking about books like Fourth Wing, A Discovery of Witches, Powerless, King of Greed and many many more, I just forgot about their titles already, sorry.

I am hoping that you can suggest any books that are well-written, like the progression feels right, the characters are not trying hard to be ""oh so weak"" ""so strong then jaw clench"" ""I'm not the kind of girl who backs out then proceeds to self-pity or misplaced and badly written instant improvent"" ""I don't want to welcome anyone in my life, I'm broken and cold"". You know? I don't hate these tropes, I used to really love them, but in most popular books? These things or like any theme they want to highlight are just so badly written that they cannot present them properly and naturally. I'm not sure how else to elaborate.

Sorry if this would offend some people but these are just my thoughts. I just really want to read good books with exciting and interesting themes. My favorite authors are Amy Harmon and Brandon Sanderson. I love how their stories somehow have the favorite tropes and yet does not feel cliche' because they write them properly.

Any other genres are welcome as long as they are somehow serious or just with good plot and well-written. And a splash of romance always adds to the magic.

Thank you!",Fantasy

1711969469.0,Review: Immortal Longings – Chloe Gong (Flesh and False Gods #1),"**Asian Fantasy** **✓** **Battle Royale** **✓** **Female Main Character** **✓** **Revenge Story** **✓ Urban** ***✓***

*“Love isn’t deserved. It is given freely.”*

**What is the Book about?**

Princess Calla has been in hiding since she murdered her parents. She wants to free the people of Talin from the tyrannical royal family. Only one person stands in her way: her extremely reclusive uncle, King Kasa. Every year, the palace organises a series of deadly games, a fight to the death – with the chance to win unimaginable riches. There, Calla finally has the chance to get close enough to her uncle to kill him. Opposite her is Anton, a young man who has fallen deep into debt. Winning the games is his last chance to save his comatose childhood sweetheart and himself from his debtors. When Anton proposes an unexpected alliance to Calla, their partnership quickly develops into a passionate, all-consuming affair. But before the games end, Calla must decide what she is playing for – her lover or her kingdom. Because no matter what happens, only one of them can leave the game alive…

**My thoughts while reading it**

***As a fan of Battle Royale games, I am naturally drawn to the “Hunger Games” setting, where only one can emerge victorious in a life-and-death struggle. With a highly original premise plunging us into an Asian cyberpunk world, Immortal Longings promises a blend of sword fights and technology, enriched by the intriguing twist of soul-switching between bodies. It sounds like an excellent concept that could provide an entertaining read. Moreover, with its beautiful cover, this book is one that simply belongs on the shelf.***

An Asian-influenced world in a city similar to Hong Kong in the 90s brings us a partly historical setting that has been transformed into something of its own. It is very fitting that something real was chosen for this kind of story, as one could also imagine a displaced future like this. Narrow alleys, partly illuminated by neon signs yet adorned with traditional Asian lanterns, create a captivating atmosphere. The presence of a divided metropolis, split into two cities, adds to the epic scale, with sprawling markets and tempting food stalls providing the perfect backdrop for intense battles. Chloe Gong skilfully strikes a balance between vivid descriptions and plot progression, her sober writing style fitting perfectly into the emotionally austere cityscape.

The magnificent setting of the modern city is also attributed to a modern magic system. People who can jump from body to body with their “soul” and capture them has great potential. How interesting is it to use the physical advantages of another person for fighting? And how cool is it that nobody knows exactly which body I’m in? (So if I want to steal delicious food, I could just quickly jump into another body and not get into trouble hehe :)) But even if this ability was used, that’s the only thing that happened with this interesting magic system, it was just used. However, despite the utilization of this fascinating magic system, its potential for exploring moral quandaries remains largely untapped. And especially since there’s a love story here, wouldn’t that be an idea to explore how much love has to do with the appearance or how much is really in the character of the person? Unfortunately, there was none of that at all.

The narrative thrusts us into a “cage fight” in the city, where only one can emerge victorious. While the survival game trope holds promise for thrilling twists, it falls short in execution. Despite the introduction of a former princess with a mysterious past, the narrative fails to capitalize on potential intrigue. The motivations behind her participation in the fight feel vague, lacking conviction. Similarly, the oppressive backdrop of the city remains underexplored, failing to evoke the sense of societal unrest hinted at. It’s pretended that there are oppressed classes here or an authoritarian leadership. But apart from a few sentences about it, there is nothing that could give rise to this feeling. So why should I believe Calla that this is her motivation? The next problem is also that there is so much info dumping and that is the only thing the author uses to build up the suspense. Unfortunately, this tends to leave you feeling annoyed. Especially in the middle part, there was no tension at all. Additionally, the anticipated epic battles are disappointingly brief, failing to deliver on the promise of visceral excitement. I don’t really like reading battles, but I have nothing against an epic, long-lasting duel, and isn’t that what the survival game trope advertises? Epic, bloody, and backstabbing battles. I haven’t seen a single one of those, I really don’t mean ONE…

For the fact that this story is written rather soberly, which suits the plot, the characters are written interestingly and emotionally enough. At first they seem a little one-dimensional, but the more time you spend with them, the more you learn to like them. Calla and Anton are two very egotistical characters that you shouldn’t really like, but after a while you find yourself rooting for them anyway. The interaction between the two was also very realistic, as only the bare minimum of conversation is done here, as the two can’t stand each other. The two provide a good basis for the story, even if the backstory of the two is unfortunately missing a little, which is why I would have liked us to have seen flashbacks of the two again and again so that we could understand their motivations better. What was also unfortunate was that the characters were very isolated and the supporting characters were barely fleshed out, failing to capitalize on the rich potential of the city’s backdrop.

In conclusion, Immortal Longings squanders its potential for an engaging narrative, instead delivering a lackluster story. Focusing more on the arena combat and injecting it with thrilling battles could have elevated the book significantly. Nevertheless, the book remains enjoyable, primarily due to its writing style, and the climactic ending leaves one eager for more. This book would certainly make a great movie! I’ll give the second book a chance, hopeful for a more engaging narrative.

1711965353.0,Need a recomendation for next fantasy series.,"Fantasy series i read up to this point and enjoyed are:

1. The Poppy Wars, by Rebecca F. Kuang
2. Licanius Trilogy, by James Islington
3. Song of Ice and Fire, by George R. R. Martin

The Poppy Wars i enjoyed, becouse it suprised me time and time again, going against my expactations. Even when i knew that it does that, haha. I also liked its darker tone and a rather grim ending. Song of Ice and Fire bought me with its political intrigue, chrismatic characters and worldbuilding. The last one being probably the most important. It was a joy to learn about different cultures and their beliefs. World felt huge and believable. Licanius trilogy came to me at a time, when i was fascinated with time travel and I still am. The best part about it was the main philosophical conflict wheter a free will can really exist in a predestined world, and how morally responsible you are for your chocies in such a world. The magic system was also really well thought out with easilly understandable rules.

I guess i am looking for another one of any o them, or a mix of all of them. Thanks!

EDIT: ""I like long series with heavy books, as i am a really fast reader. I prefer magic not to be just this mystical and unanswered phenomena, with no clear rules. When it is like that it can be arbitraryly used to overcome any threat, that characters are faced with, or to create such a threat. And I want to have something to ponder on. Some philosophical, ethical or moral dillema. Something more than just a story, adventure. And preferably, that there isn't good vs evil, but all sides of the conflict have their side of the story, so by the end maybe you want neither to win.""",Fantasy

1711959923.0,Is Cradle for me? Spoilers for Unsouled.,"I'm just about finished with Unsouled, and I am underwhelmed. I don't think the book is bad, but it doesn't do a lot that I really like either. The worldbuilding is interesting, and the allure of all the crazy magics in the world that I am yet to see certainly grabs my attention, but beyond that, I feel like the series isn't giving me anything else. The protagonist feels one-dimensional, the fact that he is just leaving after the story spends years building up his home and his family is disappointing, and the story lacks thematic depth. I've dabbled in progression fantasy before with a few different LitRPG stories, but I have similar issues with those. Is the genre just not for me? The constant drive for the protagonist's improvement feels forced, and the story seems to have barely any other conflict that just ""get stronger"" and ""protect people."" Is there some greater thematic depth that is just going over my head, or is this simply a fun adventure story about destroying evil? I hope I don't sound too snobby, I've certainly enjoyed similar stories before, it's just not what I'm looking for right now. ",Fantasy

1711951131.0,"Why is it that, of the typical ""fantasy races"", only humans are allowed to be ""people""?","This is something that's always bugged me. In a lot of typical fantasy setups, humans are the only race that gets to have a diverse set of cultures. Many cultures around the world originate from local geographical features, which influences lifestyles, socioeconomics, religions, and other customs and practices. In short, *where* you live is the biggest determining factor in *how* you live. Human cultures in fantasy settings usually reflect this, sometimes being direct analogues to real-world cultures.

On an individual level, humans are also extremely diverse. Each person has their own personality, beliefs, and lifestyle. People living in the same country, no, *household* can't even agree on what goes on a pizza, and will physically harm each other over things like sports.

Meanwhile, other fantasy races like dwarves, elves, or orcs all get completely monolithic cultures. They all act the same, dress the same, speak the same, have the same beliefs, have the same architecture, eat the same foods, and so on. At most, you might have some ethnic diversity in the form of wood elves, high elves, and dark elves, but all of those end up being their own monoliths. Their cultures are first and foremost defined by the fact that they are dwarves, elves, and orcs, rather than the environment they live in. Logically, humans, dwarves, elves, and orcs living in close proximity with each other would likely all adopt a similar culture as they intermingle with each other and deal with the same environmental factors, eventually assimilating each other's cultures as they inevitably get closer and closer.

The fantasy races also don't see as much diversity when it comes to individuals. Dwarves are all gruff miners and smiths who love metals and stones, elves are all graceful and magical and love nature, and orcs are all savages who rape, pillage, and burn. Individuals who are exceptions exist, but they're just that, exceptions, not individuals who just happen to have their own personalities, beliefs, and lifestyles because *of course they do*, that's literally what it means to be an individual.

TL;DR: Humans get to be diverse and have individuality, but the other races don't, and that's dumb",Fantasy

Oooh my, just squeaked in past the finish line this year.  Usually I'm done way before the Bingo deadline (and usually with at least 2 cards)!  This year I barely finished one, but I did finish it, on March 31.  I thought I was going to have to sub out the Druids square, but ended up reading a short druid book to make it happen.

This year started off with finishing up SPSFC 2 which took a lot of reading time and I wasn't quite able to use everything for Bingo, though I tried.  In the fall, unfortunately we had 2 medical emergencies in the family, both of which have had long-term consequences and definitely impacted my usual reading habits.  It's been a rough one, but it was nice to have Bingo to work on and take my mind off things.

This Year's Completed Card:  [https://imgur.com/o3GRtMx](https://imgur.com/o3GRtMx)  (I attached it as an image too, but not totally sure it'll show up so including a link as well.  Somewhere in all the conversions (spreadsheet to PDF to jpg) it got a bit blurry, but hopefully it shows up ok

I'm a bit behind on posting all my reviews, so some books have just ratings or maybe short reviews, but I'll get them all done eventually: [Tigrari's Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/tigrari)  I'm always up for more GR friends too – just let me know you're from r/Fantasy.

Some Random Stats (because everyone loves those, right?):

**Books by Author's Gender:** 14 female, 8 male, 2 non-binary (I think?) and 1 writing duo that I have no clue about as they are both using pseudonyms.

**Sequels (or further into a series):** 4, plus 1 that was book 5 in a series, but I haven't read book 1-4 – and that was with intentionally trying to get more of my sequels on the card!  I need a whole card of the Sequel square please.

**Standalones:** 15 I think?

**New-to-Me Authors Read:** 14 (pretty solid!  Bingo and SPSFC2 combo did a good job with this)

**Self-Pub or Small Press Books:** 12 (in great part because of SPSFC 2)

**Bingo-iest Book Read (qualified for the most squares):**  Card Mage: Slumdog Deckbuilder by Benedict Patrick hit 8 Bingo Squares – 4 hard mode, 4 normal mode

**Least Bingo-iest Book Read**:  The Measure by Nikki Erlick.  I really enjoyed this book I read for my SFF book club, but it managed to not qualify for a single Bingo square!  Such a bummer, great book though.  Honorable Mention to Six Wakes by Mur Lafferty which qualified for only 1 square that I'd already filled.  Also a good read!

**Longest Book Read During Bingo:** **Earthship** by John Triptych with Michel Lamontagne (576 pages) – not nearly as long as the longest from the last two years.  Looking at you Diana Gabaldon!

**Shortest Book Read During Bingo:** **Penric's Demon** by Lois McMaster Bujold (103 pages).  Super enjoyable novella.  Will be reading more of this series (but I have enjoyed all the Bujold books I've read to date, so I was not surprised).

**Oldest Book Read for Bingo:** **The Haunting of Hill House** by Shirley Jackson (1959) – I honestly thought it was going to be Solaris by Stanislaw Lem (1961) which was my “Bottom of the TBR” book.  Surprise!

**First Book Read this Bingo Season:** Shakedowners by Justin Woolley – read for SPSFC 2.

**Last Book Read (to date) this Bingo Season:** **The King's Mage** by Iris Foxglove.  Damn Druids square almost got me.  Finished this tonight.

**Personal 5 Star Ratings:**  None, which really surprises me.  I'm not a super critical scorer usually, but for whatever reason nothing hit 5 stars.  I had several at 4.5, but no perfect 5s.  Usually I have at least a few!

**Personal 1 Star Ratings:** Also none, for books I finished.  My lowest score was a 1.5 for **Earthship** (SPSFC 2 read).  This one just didn't do it for me, and it was also my longest book read, which may have played into it as I was reading it for awhile.  That being said, one of my other low scores was a 2 for **In the Vanishers' Palace** which was quite short!  It really dragged for me though in spite of liking the premise a lot.  I'm a big character reader and the characters just didn't do much for me in this story.

**Highest GR Average Rating:** **Sweep of the Heart** by Ilona Andrews (4.53 rating) – self-pub and deep in a series books tend to skew GR averages, and this proves my point on that.  Self-pub by a popular author and book #5 in the series.

**Lowest GR Average Rating:** **The Mimicking of Known Successes** by Malka Older (3.65 rating) – I quite liked this one and gave it a 4 from my own ratings.  Thanks to HEA Book Club on this sub for selecting it since I would not have found it otherwise.

**Most GR Ratings:** **The Haunting of Hill House** by Shirley Jackson (302.089 ratings) – not too shabby for a book published well before the internet was a thing!

**Least GR Ratings:** **Super-Borg Dies** by Tac Anderson (17 ratings now) - support your self-pub authors, go read this if you liked the Superhero square!  Also, I owe a review on this one, bad me.  This was a creative take on the Superhero genre set in a not-too-far-future dystopian Seattle.  I read a bit of it for SPSFC 2 and decided to go back to read it for the Superhero square.

**Strongest Reading Month by Page Count:** April 2023 - apparently I was going strong at the start of the Bingo season (again)!  I read five books in April, clocking in at just over 2000 pages.  Four of these were for SPSFC 2 but they all made it onto the card.  The last book was for my SFF book club (**Six Wakes** by Mur Lafferty) and it only qualified for one Bingo square that I'd already filled with a self-pubbed book, so it didn't make the card.

**Easiest Bingo Square:** Mundane Jobs winning by a landslide for me with 22 qualifying books (out of 36 read this season).

**Hardest Bingo Square (Hard Mode):**  Druids.  OMG, WHAT were people thinking with this vote???  I had a rough time finding something that qualified here.  I'm a little salty about the hard mode too as I genuinely enjoyed the Iron Druid books but never finished the series.  I'd have loved to read another of those if it didn't disqualify for hard mode!

# And now, I present... A Few Random Awards I Totally Made Up:

**The Author I Binged in Spite of Bingo Rules**: Ilona Andrews – AGAIN.  Last year I binged the Hidden Legacy series during Bingo.  This year it was a re-read/catch up on the Innkeeper series, plus reading the latest installment that was a fresh read for me (**Sweep of the Heart**).  None of them ended up on my Bingo card, oddly enough.  Although it fulfilled several Bingo squares, none of them were ones that I hadn't filled already.  I think I meant to use it for sequel and ended up shuffling Black Powder War there instead?

**Favorite New-to-Me Author:** Rory August for **The Last Gifts of the Universe** which was the winner of SPSFC 2.  Reminds me a lot of early Becky Chambers in the best way.  Great book and highly recommended.

**Most Enjoyed Book that Didn't Make the Card**: **The Measure** by Nikki Erlick. I very much enjoyed this book but it didn't qualify for a single Bingo square.  It was a thinker though – everyone on Earth receives a box with a string in it that shows how long you'll live, but not how you'll die and nothing you do changes the duration of your lifespan.  Would you want to know the length of your life?  Would it change how you chose to live the time you have?

**Best Food (or Drink) Writing**: **Sunshine** by Robin McKinley – Sunshine is a baker and I want to eat all of her creations.  They sound amaaaaazing.  I wanted to bake through the whole book.  There are actually several runners up for food writing on my card – I have to tip my hat on this one to the Red Cleaver Chef, Orro in Ilona Andrews' **Innkeeper** books, the sugar-addicted hexarch in **Raven Stratagem** by Yoon Ha Lee, and of course the chocolate temptations of **Small Miracles** by Olivia Atwater.  I also definitely still want some of the cinnamon rolls from **Legends & Lattes**.  I love food writing, so I think there are probably a few more on my card I should call out here!

1711945515.0,A Review of 'Play of Shadows' by Sebastien de Castell,"[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42291958-play-of-shadows?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=q8astDZHWg&rank=15)

I got a copy of this book off Netgalley for free for the purpose of review. I read this 500 page book in a single sprint today, and this review is my off-the-cuff reactions. As you can tell by the fact I read a 500 page book in a single day, I really enjoyed this book. Mild spoilers below.

This is my first de Castell book. It is a swashbuckling adventure in the vein of 'The Three Musketeers,' but without any muskets. The protagonist Demalas is an actor who has become possessed by a long-dead ghost of a traitor to the crown. The only way for Demalas to be free of the ghost, is to re-enact the ghost's death. MANY people will do anything to prevent this ghost revealing long forgotten sensitive political secrets, so now Demalas has a target placed on his head.

What follows is a race against time. With a city descending into chaos as nobles and gangs vie for power against a weak Duke, Demalas and his drama troupe must uncover the secrets of the past in order to save the present. I enjoyed the plot's final reveal; the final battle felt compelling, even if it felt like it went on a bit too long.

I would compare this book's setting to Pratchett's Ankh-Morpork, but without the humor and magic; a medieval town where the rules governing society are a wee bit surreal. This book is not grimdark, even as dark things happen; this book is dark (characters die), but it's not nihilistic. The characters like to quip mid-battle, a la Zorro or 'The Princess Bride.' This is the sort of book you want to read when you want an emotional pick-me-up. I enjoyed the author's occassional use of wordplay.

I liked the side characters. Ellias takes method acting to a whole new level of madness; his personality so vivid he's practically dripping off the page. I enjoyed the understated romance between Demalas and the Black Amaranth (an assassin who may or may not be ordered to kill Demalas). The antagonist 'The Vixin' was a delight for her ranting and raving, and also good fight scenes. Demalas himself has hidden depths which were delightful to read.

But it's not perfect. If I'm being honest, only Demalas had a significant amount of personality interiority. (Interiority= 3D personality). The bad guys (called the Black Orchids) were not fully realized as characters; they felt primarily like bad guys who exist mainly to be killed guilt-free. And one character kinda got fridged.  

However, by the end, I was emotionally invested in the fate of the Knights of the Curtain (the name of this theater troupe). MAJOR SPOILERS: When the theater burned down and several characters died, I'll admit I shed a tear. The author successfully sold the found-family vibe amongst these characters. The setting was vibrant and colorful.

I don't think this book will be good for everyone, but it will be broadly enjoyable for most people. This is VERY MUCH SO a swashbuckling romp, where good people go on an adventure to save the day. If you're in the mood for some compelling fun, where actors must save the day by inspiring people through acting, check this book out.",Fantasy

**Title With a Title: Yumi and the Nightmare Painter** by **Brandon Sanderson**\- rating: 5/5

Okay, I might be slightly overrating this with a perfect 5/5, but I just really loved this book, primarily because of Yumi and Painter's relationship.

**Superheroes: The Engineer** by **Will Wight** \- rating: 4/5

As much as as I enjoy Wight's writing, this series hasn't quite grabbed me the way Cradle did so far. ""Evil Superman"" is an overdone trope and I feel like Starhammer wasn't a particularly unique execution of it, and they needed to develop his relationship with Mel more. Still a very fun read, and the ending made me very excited for the future of the series.

**Bottom of the TBR: American Born Chinese** by **Gene Luen Yang** \- rating: 4.5/5

Loved both how this book showed the immigrant experience and the fantasy elements rooted in Chinese mythology. Great story and the major plot twist was very well-executed.

**Magical Realism: Kindred** by **Octaiva E. Butler** \- rating: 5/5

Easily the best book I read last year. The book did a great job of showing the horrors of slavery and how easily they can be normalized. As a fan of hard magic I didn't love the lack of any explanation for the time travel, but that's just my tastes and has little to do with the actual quality of the book.

**Young Adult: The Spice Road** by **Maya Ibrahim** \- rating: 3.5/5

A very average YA novel with a Middle Eastern setting. I enjoyed it a decent amount, and I actually thought it did a decent job of portraying how privelege made the main protagonist blind to problems in her society, but the rest of the book did little to stand out, and the romance subplot in particular was kinda cliche and cringy.

**Mundane Jobs: City of Strife** by **Claudie Arsenault** \- rating: 4/5

I really liked (most of) the characters in this book, and I appreciated how much LGBT representation, particularly aroace, this book had. That being said, I think the book did a poor job of meshing together all the disparate plot threads, and the main villain wasn't particularly interesting.

**Published in the 00s: Blue Beetle Vol. 1: Shellshocked** by **Keith Giffen, Cully Hammer and John Rogers** \- rating: 4/5

I read this in preparation for the Blue Beetle movie (which btw is very underrated and worth a watch) and enjoyed it a lot. However, I barely remember what happens in it by the time of writing this, so evidently it wasn't anything out-of-this-world.

**Angels and Demons: Good Omens** by **Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett** \- rating: 4.5/5

As a huge fan of both Pratchett and Gaiman, I found that their writing styles meshed very well and made for a very fun read. While I enjoyed the book for the most part, I have... mixed feelings on the ending.

**Five Short Stories: Exhalation** by **Ted Chiang** \- rating: 4.5/5

A great collection of short fiction with a lot of variety. My favorites were The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate, The Great Silence, and Anxiety Is the Dizziness of Freedom.

**Horror: Annihilation** by **Jeff Vandermeer** \- rating: 4.5/5

A someone who doesn't really read or watch much horror, I really liked this book. I think ""nature horror"" like this is really interesting in how it shows that some things are just beyond humans' ability to control. The writing style was a little slower than I'm used to but I still really enjoyed it.

**Self-Published: Red Dot** by **Mike Karpa** \- rating: 4/5

By far the most obscure book I read last year, I chanced upon this thanks to a recommendation by another user here. I really liked how this book had a ""post-post-apocalyptic"" setting, which I don't see too often, and I appreciated how it did a story about AI with a ""cozy"" vibe with no killer robots or end-of-the-world disaster. I found it weird how often ""blockchaining"" was mentioned, although the way it was used makes me suspect that the author just doesn't understand what that actually means.

**Middle East: The Stardust Thief** by **Chelsea Abdullah** \- rating: 4/5

A decent YA novel with a Middle Eastern setting. I found it pretty enjoyable, and I liked how classic stories like Arabian Nights were used in the world-building. That being said, I don't think it did anything special or groundbreaking.

**Published in 2023: Threads That Bind** by **Kika Hatzopolou** \- rating: 4/5

A debut YA novel that deserves more love. I'm a fan of both Greek mythology and murder mysteries so this book worked really well for me. That being said, it's still a YA book and couldn't really do much to stand out beyond it's unique premise, but it's still very solid for a debut novel.

**Multiverse: The Will of the Many** by **James Islington** \- rating: 4.5/5

One of the most popular new releases of 2023, and it's easy to see why. The story, writing and settting all pulled me in immediately, and the various mysteries will keep me guessing right up to the release of the second book.

**POC Author: Noor** by **Nnedi Okarafor** \- rating: 4.5/5

A really solid short novel with an interesting Afrofuturism setting. The setting, basic plot, and political themes were all great, but I felt the writing left a little to be desired.

**Book Club: The Justice of Kings** by **Richard Swan** \- rating: 4/5

A pretty solid opening book to the trilogy, it was pretty engaging, and I enjoyed the philosophizing about the role of the justice system. I do feel like the ""mystery"" aspect was a little weak, however. It was enough to get me to read the whole trilogy, which I enjoyed, particularly the second book.

**Novella: This Is How You Lose the Time War** by **Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone** \- rating: 4.5/5

Not much to say about this book that hasn't been said already. Red and Blue's dynamic was great and made the book a pleasure to read, and I liked how much they developed the world in a short book with relatively limited scope (although I would 100% read a longer novel series set in this world).

**Mythical Beasts: Spinning Silver** by **Naomi Novik** \- rating: 4.5/5

(I'm counting >!Czernobog !<as a mythical beast for this category, plus the Staryk have clear inspirations from real myths). A real interesting and unique take on the story of Rumpelstiltsken. It was great watching the relationships between the main characters all develop, particularly with the antagonists.

**Elemental Magic: The Legacy of Yangchen** by **F. C. Yee** \- rating: 4/5

The ATLA spinoff books are pretty great and need more love! I really enjoyed the political games and characters trying to outwit each other in the Yangchen books. My biggest complaint came from overuse of non-chonological storytelling, to the point where it got a little unecessarily confusing near the end.

**Myths/Retellings: In the Lives of Puppets** by **T. J. Klune** \- rating: 4.5/5

A really interesting take on Pinnochio, with a neat post-apocalyptic world and great gay and ace representation. The side characters, especially Nurse Ratched, really elevated the book as well.

**Queernorm: Legends & Lattes** by **Travis Baldree** \- rating: 4.5/5

I'm a little late to the party on this one, but I'm glad I finally got to read the book that got everyone raving about ""cozy fantasy"". I really enjoyed how the book really stuck to avoiding any major action the whole time. Also Thimble is precious.

**Coastal/Island: The Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi** by **S. A. Chakraborty** \- rating: 4/5

A really solid book with a lot to love. I really liked Amina as a protagonist, especially since it's rare that middle-aged mothers get to be main protagonists. I wasn't fond of how so much worldbuilding was thrown at the reader very near the end of the book, however.

**Druids: The Jasmine Throne** by **Tasha Suri** \- rating: 4.5/5

This book hooked me really quickly, between the politics and power struggles between the various factions, the worldbuilding, and the characters. I'm very excited to continue reading the rest of this series.

**Robots: All Systems Red + Artificial Condition** by **Martha Wells** \- rating: 4.5/5

The Murderbot series is quickly becoming one of my all-time favorites. All Systems Red was a solid start, and Artificial Condition elevated it even further. Murderbot is a great protagonist, and his character development has been fascinating.

**Sequel: Babylon's Ashes** by **James S. A. Corey** \-rating: 4.5/5

The Expanse is the most recent addition to my favorite series list. I read books 4-9 within the book bingo period so any of them could have filled this space, but I chose Babylon's Ashes because it was my favorite of the bunch. I loved seeing a full-scale war break out, and getting follow-ups for almost every character in the series up to then. Plus, this is the only book to feature both of my favorite characters, Chrisjen Avasarala and Anna Valmont, so that automatically elevated it. My only complaint with this book, and Nemesis Games before it, was how the ""ancient unknowable aliens"" part of the plot took a backseat.",Fantasy
1711944350.0,LitRPG bingo card,"As a general note most of these books are LitRPG. I think LitRPG books as a subgenre tend to be fun and creative but may not have the polish or breadth of options you expect from fantasy more broadly. They are also generally self-published or indie publishers if you need that for a future bingo card. Many of these reviews are as much about the series as the book itself. All of these books are fine to great so and I think fit is going to matter more than quality so I’ve opted not to put ratings on them.

Iron Prince - Title with a Title.
Sci-fi military academy with a touch of mech transformations. A little on the YA side of things.

Wish Upon the Stars (Malcolm Tent)– Superheroes.
High tech fantasy/superhero setting with a unique way method of gaining power.

The Primal Hunter - Bottom of the TBR.
Diving into an apocalypse with new rules and powers. 

Foundations (Cale Plamann)– No Ifs, Ands, or Buts (Substitute).
This reminds me of Shadowrun with a well written struggle to get free of corporate debt slavery.

All the Skills 2– Young Adult.
A YA story with dragons, interesting powers and struggles to stay hidden and grow stronger.

Apocalypse Redux - Mundane Jobs.
Travel back in time to try to stop humanity from summoning monsters into an apocalypse.

Furies of Calderon – Published in the 00s.
This was my reread. I’ll probably finish rereading the series as it’s been a while but this is probably my least favorite of Jim Butcher’s novels. If Pokémon plus lost Roman legion sounds really exciting to you give it a try, otherwise I’d start with The Aeronaut’s Windlass If you want to try Butcher’s writing. 

Tree of Aeons - Angels and Demons.
Reincarnated into a tree and shaping battles for the world. Growing stronger, building community and all that jazz. 

The System Apocalypse Short Story Anthology II – Five SFF Short Stories (anthology).
If you haven’t read some of the System Apocalypse series this probably isn’t worth reading but if you have the anthology has amazing variety of perspectives and ability that blend well together into a great anthology. 

The Eye of the Bedlam Bride – Horror.
This one may be on the edge of horror. I’d recommend the Dungeon Crawler Carl series generally, especially as an audiobook, though it definitely won’t be for everyone. This is book 6 so I’ll mostly leave it at aliens forcing humans into a death game and constantly messing with them for entertainment and profit.

Oh Great! I was Reincarnated as a Farmer - Self-Published or Indie Publisher.
This is not a cozy novel. Benjamin Kerei’s humor lands beautifully for me and the world building and creative problem solving are well executed. 

Throne of the Crescent Moon - Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF.
This is a great step away from Western fantasy without feeling unrelated. 

The Path of Ascension 2 – Published in 2023.
Space fantasy from weak to powerful 

Defiance of the Fall 10 – Multiverse and Alternate Realities.
Defiance of the Fall has some great 

Apocalypse Assassin – POC Author.
A post apocalypitic world where an orphan seeks revenge against those who wronged her. 

Orconomics – Book Club OR Readalong Book.
A great satirical look at fantasy and economics. 

Rock Falls, Everyone Dies – Novella.
This is an incredible story and piece of satire. The epic quest of a rock.

The Antventure Begins - Mythical Beasts.
Reincarnated into a monstrous ant and the struggle to learn, survive and pun. 

Domestication – Elemental Magic.
A fun mix of slice of life and fantasy adventure with an isekai MC years after they arrive in the world.

The Last Gods – Myths and Retellings.
I think this did a good job capturing the feel of Greek epics, I’m just not sure the style is for me. 

Earth Force – Queernorm Setting.
Humanity has collapsed. Now they must struggle to understand the new monsters, technology, powers, and galactic threats.

He Who Fights with Monsters 9 – Coastal or Island Setting.
Isekai series with great world building. The MC is a little divisive between fun or insufferable which tends to make or break novels.

Everything – Druids.
A group of friends struggle to safe themselves from a dictator and heal the kingdom of the damage from old wars. 

Towers of Heaven 2 – Featuring Robots.
Giant towers have arrived on Earth. Clear the towers before humanity goes extinct. 

Fracture (Red Mage #3) – Sequel.
A LitRPG apocalypse with the struggle to survive and rebuild.",Fantasy
1711942761.0,Best fantasy romance novels similar to the ACOTAR series but with more of a mythology/female warrior influence?,"I just finished reading the ACOTAR series (first fantasy series I’ve ever read) and I’m looking for similar books in terms of fantasy and romance level but with more of a gods/godess vibe. Love ACOTAR for the character development and magic and romance. Looking for something with female warrior themes, power, magic, romance (nothing overly cheesy). One thing I found about ACOTAR is it felt a bit too YA for me, looking for something a bit deeper perhaps. Also preferably not real world settings. :)",Fantasy

1711938830.0,2023 Bingo mini reviews (complete card even though I only found bingo in January),"&#x200B;

[My card](https://preview.redd.it/aei7q3xmwprc1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=fea4f61a3cd9d54c750954ca296679c60b146a6d)

I found r/Fantasy and learned about bingo in early January, so a lot of my card is backfilled with things I read before then.  Despite the short timeline, this was definitely a worthwhile experience for me and I'm looking forward to participating next year with a bit less time pressure.  Bingo definitely gave me an incentive to read things outside of my comfort zone, some of which I enjoyed, and also helped me identify some gaps in my reading habits.  It's been fun!  

My reviews range in length and content.  Any spoilers are marked as such.  Webtoons are denoted and everything else is a book (except for the short stories).  

**Title With a Title -** *Cursed Princess Club* by LambCat (webtoon)

* This is one of my favorite webtoons and I'm really sad that it's now complete because I don't get to read new episodes any more.  I don't think I can do it justice, but it's a really well done comic that I think a wide range of audiences would enjoy.  It doesn't take itself seriously until it needs to, and then does a really good job of it.  Some of the major themes are identity, love (mostly not the romantic kind), and self-acceptance.  Also, the whole ""cursed princess"" thing is an allegory for disability, which I somehow completely missed the first time I read it.  It would definitely get 5 stars from me if I was doing star ratings.

**Superheroes -** *Heroine Complex* by Sarah Kuhn

* Didn't love it, didn't hate it.  Might check out the rest of the series eventually.  I found it to be too predictable.  If you're looking for a light read about friendship, growing up, and the pressures of fame, it'd be a good pick.

**~~Bottom of the TBR~~** **Witches (substitution from 2021 bingo) -** *The Witch and The Bull* by Moonsia (webtoon)

* Really didn't expect this to be the category I'd use a substitution for, but somehow actually finding a book that's been on my TBR for a long time proved quite difficult.  As far as webtoons go, this one had been on my list for a while before I actually started reading it a few months ago and very nicely matched the 2021 Witches square, so it felt like a fitting replacement.  I've enjoyed reading the first 3 seasons and am excited to see how the story will continue in season 4 whenever it releases.

**Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy -** *The Gray House* by Mariam Petrosyan

* I don't think I've ever read another book that was this weird and confusing.  I'm still unsure if I liked it.  I'm also unsure if I really understood it.  I think I'm done with magical realism for a while.

**Young Adult -** *A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking* by T. Kingfisher

* Just finished this a few hours ago (cutting it close, I know).  I really enjoyed it!  I often get frustrated with YA because the characters are very 16 years old and I am not, but this doesn't have that problem and is just such a fun story.  I'd definitely recommend it.

**Mundane Jobs -** *Faerie Fallen* by Carol Beth Anderson

* On a planet far from Earth (yes really), a faerie is sent (glamoured) to tutor a human teenager in the Fae language.  If you think that sounds like the start of a romance story, you're not wrong, but this book has so more much depth than I was expecting.  Ignore the romance and read it for everything else, but maybe wait for the sequel to be released first because this does end on a cliffhanger.

**Published in the 00s -** *The Eyre Affair* by Jasper Fforde (published 2001)

* I've been meaning to read more of Fforde's work ever I read *Shades of Grey* some time in high school, but somehow never did.  When I saw his debut novel at a bookstore and realized when it had first been published, it somehow felt like fate.  Definitely a bit of an odd book, but one that had me smiling and laughing at the wordplay and cleverness of the prose.  It was a fun and unique story that never stopped moving and only took as much time as it needed to be told.  I think it would make a perfect breather in between long books.

**Angels and Demons -** *180 Angel* by King Katbird (webtoon)

* I ended up with a lot of things I read this year to choose from for this square (what can I say, I'm a sucker for characters with wings), but ultimately decided to go with this hidden gem from webtoon canvas (self-published) because it's a great story that I'm surprised hasn't gained a bigger following.  I think it really starts to hit it's stride about halfway through season 1 (the season 2 finale just dropped).  The setting is far from unique (you really can't get more classic than heaven, hell, and earth), but the creator has really put his own spin on it with fun little details and the story feels fresh and exciting.  It's about growing into adulthood as much as anything else and I've been enjoying joining the main character as she figures out more about herself and who she wants to be.  

**Five Short Stories -** all from Uncanny Magazine

* *Lily, the Immortal* by Kylie Lee Baker - my husband sent me this one.  As someone with chronic illness who has been struggling with my own identity, this hit really close to home and made me cry a bunch.  I loved it.
* *Tower* by Lane Waldman - probably my least favorite out of these five.  >!It's a retelling of Rapunzel and has more than one story within just its one story.  !<I'm not sure if I really got it.
* *The Tailor and the Beast* by Aysha U. Farah - this was a lot of fun, everything I never knew I wanted from a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.  Highly recommend.
* *A Recipe for Hope and Honeycake* by Jordan Taylor - what a sweet little story, definitely felt fairy tale inspired despite not being one.  It made me feel all warm and nice inside and I teared up at the end.
* *A Piece of the Continent* by Marissa Lingen - stopped before I was ready for it to end, which was exactly when it was done.  If this was expanded into a novel, I'd read it.  My only complaint was a triflingly small quibble: >!The narrating character is ostensibly from the Boston area, yet uses the term milkshake to refer to what the rest of the country calls a milkshake (contains ice cream, known as a frappe in Massachusetts) instead of what we in Massachusetts call a milkshake (no ice cream).  I should not care this much and yet, as a lifelong Bostonian, I do.!<

**Horror -** *The Wicked and the Willing* by Lianyu Tan

* I really don't like horror almost ever.  In most cases, I'm either bored or very, very freaked out (like to the point where it keeps me up).  Yet when I went to backfill, I somehow already had two choices for this square.  The other was the webtoon ""Everything is Fine"" by Mike Birchall, which I like much better than this one.  Go read that, it's a great story.  A lot of why I picked this one for the square is that I have so much to say about it.  It's set in 1920's Singapore and the author did a great job of really immersing me in the time period (I assume she did a lot of research to get it historically accurate, but I don't otherwise know anything about the setting, so don't blame me if you do and you read this and it's all wrong).  Some of the events in the book were deeply horrifying and often portrayed in a way that helped emphasize how wrong they were.  I couldn't figure out whether I liked the book for most of the time I was reading it, but thought I liked it was it got towards the end, and then I hated the ending and once I got to it, I realized that it was why I had been so unsure about the book.  Explanation of why is below with spoilers.
* >!This is a fantasy romance novel and there are two different endings the reader can pick between, each with the MC ending up with a different person.  It's not a bad concept for a book, however, it meant that neither of those two relationships got developed properly prior to the ending.  I also didn't realize this had two possible endings until I got to the point where I had to pick, so I spent a lot of the book confused about who the MC was supposed to end up with (in romance, usually it's clear who the love interest is within the first few chapters).  This was all also all the more frustrating because one of the endings was clearly correct!  Full on spoilers now, the choice is between the very abusive vampire mistress and another servant who had mostly been friendly.  The story actually did a pretty good job of showing the MC growing to like and trust the vampire mistress and then slowly revealing just how dangerous and abusive she was, in parallel with showing the MC build a close friendship with the other servant.  Towards the end of the story, the other servant presents a plan for them to escape together, but the MC refuses to go until she is almost killed by the vampire mistress and only then opts to leave.  It's honestly such a nice story arc about recognizing and leaving an abusive relationship and some karma even catches up with the vampire mistress.  But then the vampire mistress finds them a few days later and that's when the book presents the ending choice.  And yes, I picked the correct option with the other servant, but this book was so close to being amazing and the existence of the other ending was what held it back.  I could've loved it, but instead I'm just frustrated. !<

**Self-Published or Indie Publisher -** *Aurora's Angel* by Emily Noon

* Hands down my favorite book I read this year.  It was recommended to me by someone in r/RomanceBooks in reply to my post asking for books with winged characters and it had almost everything I mentioned liking.  The story was immersive and set in a rich world that included both unique and familiar elements.  In particular, I enjoyed the creative and thoughtful details about different types of animal shifters and the dynamics between them.  The characters in the book felt realistic and nuanced, as did the way the relationship between the main characters progressed throughout the story.  I can't believe that a book I loved this much is someone's debut novel and I'm eagerly awaiting whatever Emily Noon decides to write next!  

**Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF -** *The City of Brass* by S.A. Chakraborty 

* I enjoyed both this book and the sequel, and am looking forward to finishing the trilogy soon (I'd be done if I hadn't needed to read a few other things for bingo before the month ended).  The book does a great job of slowly revealing things to the reader as the main character learns about them.  Characters were typically presented as a whole people, such that I could usually understand and empathize to some degree even with the antagonists.  
* It also took an interesting path with character perspectives.  Spoiler free, different perspectives were used exactly as they should be to add depth and nuance to the world, characters, and plot points.  Minor spoilers, >!there are two narrating characters for most of the book, but they don't initially know each other and aren't even in the same location for much of the story.  Instead, one narrating character is in the city that the other is traveling to, which meant that by the time the other character got there, I already knew a lot about the city and had a good understanding of the complicated political situation.  The series only gets better in book two, adding additional character perspectives that serve the same function of making everything richer and more interesting.  !<  

**Published in 2023 -** *Fourth Wing* by Rebecca Yarros 

* My nomination for this subreddit's ""we love to hate"" book of 2023.   Personally, I loved it.  Couldn't put it down and finished the whole audiobook in like three days.  I haven't had a book catch me up like that in quite a while and it was fun the whole way through.  It felt like everything I loved to read in my teens and younger, but aged up for adult me.  It had dragons, school, secrets, love, friendship, and even invisible disability representation!  I see very little representation of chronic illnesses or invisible disabilities in the books I read and it's something that is especially meaningful to me as someone who is still coming to terms with my own chronic illness.  Oh, and there was romance too, but I wouldn't have minded if they had just stayed friends.  Didn't like the sequel as much.  If you like new adult, fast paced stories, and romance, I'd give it a read.  

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities -** *The Never King* by Nikki St. Crowe

* It's a *Peter Pan* retelling that's reverse harem dark romance (and set several generations after the events of *Peter Pan*).  This book was decent, but I thought the rest of the series included too much sex at the expense of plot progression.  Purely evaluating this on its success as a *Peter Pan* retelling though, I think it does a pretty good job.  It keeps the core familiar elements of the original story, then expands on them in ways I wouldn't have thought of.  I'm not sure how much it comes up in this one, but the later books go into more detail about the rest of the world surrounding Neverland.  If you're really into Peter Pan retellings, this book is worth a read.  From a romance book perspective, I did enjoy reading later books in the series despite not usually liking RH, so I'd say to check them out if you like dark romance or RH ([TW list](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkRomance/comments/1518gw7/dark_peter_pan_retelling/)).  

**POC Author -** *Witchmark* by C. L. Polk

* I reread all of C. L. Polk's The Kingston Cycle earlier this year, so this is a review of the whole series, not just the first book.  I love the setting, which the back of the book accurately describes as, ""reminiscent of Edwardian England.""  The world felt real, as if English cities 100 years ago were actually just as described in the book.  In many cases, I found myself questioning whether a small detail was based on something real or entirely made up.  The food descriptions in particular were so vivid that I still wish I could try many of the dishes described in the book (I spent longer than I should have googling ""glauce"" in an attempt to replicate a cocktail from book 2).  There is romance in the series (a different couple in each book), but it really takes a back seat to the rest of the plot and I don't believe there's anything explicit.  I like the way the books explore adult problems, responsibilities, and relationships in a setting that feels very real, while using fantasy elements to highlight and exacerbate them.  The first book is a mystery story and, while the later two don't include that to the same degree, all three books have problem solving as a significant element.  
* The series includes a little bit of a lot of different things, all done quite well.  I'd actually recommend that anyone take a look at the description of the first book (from the back of the book or goodreads or wherever) and try reading it if the description sounds at all interesting.  I believe this series can be enjoyed by a wide range of different readers.   

**Book Club or Readalong Book -** *Legends and Lattes* by Travis Baldree

* I had started listening to this with my husband before I found bingo, and then bingo gave me the kick I needed to finish it.  I liked it, but didn't love it.  It's a wonderful little story, but as my husband put it, ""nothing happened and it's pure fluff.""  If you want a cozy fantasy story and somehow haven't read this yet, I'd read it.  

**Novella -** *The Demon's Bargain* by Katee Robert

* Katee Robert is probably my favorite romance author and this book did not disappoint.  It's technically book six in her A Deal With A Demon series, but every book in the series is standalone (you just get a bit more exposition and catch some fun details if you read them in order) and also book five isn't out yet.  Read the series if you like romance in a fantasy setting.  I haven't read book four yet, but the first three and this one are all really lovely and sweet little romance stories.  If you're a fantasy reader looking to dip your toes into romance without any significant external plot, I think this series would be a good pick.  Also, Katee Robert does a really good job of including thorough lists of tropes, tags, and content warnings at the start of each book and on her website, which I'd love to see more authors doing across all genres.  

**Mythical Beasts -** *SubZero* by Junepurrr (webtoon)

* This was one of the first webtoons I ever started reading (about a year and a half ago), but I stopped reading for a while and didn't actually catch up until a few months ago.  It's about an arranged marriage between a prince and princess from enemy clans who can both turn into dragons.  Beautiful artwork, good emotional depth to the characters, less romance and more plot than you'd think from the description and first few episodes, currently trending in 4th place on the webtoon originals ranking chart.  

**Elemental Magic -** *The Solace of Sharp Claws* by Lana Pecherczyk

* I binged every audiobook in this series over the summer, so this is a review of the series (up to book 8).  It's a neat post-apocalyptic fantasy setting.  Each book has a self-contained romance and also progresses the overarching plot of the series.  I thought that every book had a pretty good balance between the romance and the external plot.  Though the books are fairly formulaic, they don't feel repetitive as the author did a good job of giving each a distinct problem and varied characters.  
* My only real complaint is that they're a bit heteronormative and definitely play into gender stereotypes.  No explicit homophobia or anything like that (I think there might even be a gay side character somewhere?), but the series is planned to have 12 different couples (so 24 main characters), plus a few novellas, which is a lot of missed opportunities to show a variety of different types of couples (and maybe the author has realized that and plans to include them in the last three books, that would be nice).  

**Myths and Retellings -** *A Ruin of Roses* by K. F. Breene

* I read about 90% of this book in July, but never got around to finishing it until this week.  It's a beauty and the beast retelling.  Mostly I didn't finish it because I broke my rule of not stopping in the middle of a sex scene (I usually don't want to pick up the book again if I do that), but nothing much really happened in the \~30 pages I read this week anyways, so I don't think I really missed out.  It wasn't my favorite, probably won't look for the sequel.   

**Queernorm Setting -** *Blades of Furry* by Deya Muniz & Emily Erdos (webtoon)

* I spent ages questioning if all the characters being anthropomorphic animals was enough to make this speculative fiction before I realized one of the characters is >!a vampire!<, so yeah.  I only started reading this webtoon a month or two ago and I've been enjoying it.  Much of the story revolves around the sport of battle skating, which according to the info blurb is ""a high-stakes combo of figure skating and martial arts.""  It might be a bit too dangerous for real life, but I'd watch it.  I'd definitely check this webtoon if you enjoy figure skating.  This is mostly a comfort read for me, though there is >!a stalker!< and depictions of injuries, so it's not entirely light.  

**Coastal or Island Setting -** *The Croaking* by echorise (webtoon)

* I started reading this for the characters with wings, but stayed for the mystery and intrigue.  I finally know what ""the croaking"" is now, so that's neat.  I've enjoyed getting to slowly understand both the world and each character's motivations throughout the story.  This webtoon does a particularly good job of showing character development, which I think is very impressive for the number of different characters that the story follows.  Also, it starts at a military academy, so if you read Fourth Wing, it's nothing like that.  

**Druid -** *The First Girl Child* by Amy Harmon

* It took me a while to finish this.  It moves pretty slowly and I was never sure how things were going to happen.  Couldn't figure out how much I liked the book until I was done and I think I enjoyed it, but probably wouldn't reread.   

**Features Robots -** *Space Boy* by Stephen McCranie (webtoon)

*  At 345 episodes, this is the longest webtoon I've read.  The art style is pretty unique, very 50's comic book, like Richie Rich or Archie or those ""house of the future"" posters.  The setting somehow feels simultaneously retro, futuristic, and modern.  One of the major themes is sense of self.  I don't know how to do a good job of explaining *Space Boy*, but it's a wonderfully thoughtful story and I've cried more than once while reading it.  

**Sequel -** *Death's Abyss* by SD Simper

*  The title is excessively dramatic for the story in this book and I didn't think it really fit.  I read all three books in this trilogy back to back and can't remember where the events of book 2 ended and where the events of book 3 (this one) began.  It's about merfolk, love, a princess, and a corrupt monarch.  Also religion?  The series honestly wasn't super memorable.  Find a list of trigger warnings if you want to read it.  

&#x200B;

Personal note: Really didn't expect ""Bottom of the TBR"" to be the category I'd use a substitution on, but I somehow don't really have a functional TBR?  I've had two things majorly change my reading habits in the past few years, the second of which was the start of a chronic illness that often prevents me from reading novels (so I switched to mostly audiobooks and webtoons).  None of my audiobooks or webtoons have been in their respective TBR lists for all that long, even most of my physical books haven't been on the list for all that long (plus I can't reliably actually read most of them), and everything older that I could think of was from when I was in high school or younger (more than 10 years ago).   - and out of the two physical books, one is contemporary and the other is book 4 of a series that I need to reread first and have lost book 1 of (and no, they don't have it at the library).

Running the numbers for squares on my bingo board:

* 7 that I completed in the last 10 days of March (most were started much earlier)
* 6 filled by things I read specifically for bingo
* 2 books I started a while ago, but finished specifically for bingo
* 1 book finished on March 31

Medium-specific numbers:

* 3 physical books
* 5 online short stories
* 7 webtoons
* 14 audiobooks

As a personal note, I'm really happy that I was able to read three physical books for bingo this year.  About a year and a half ago, I developed a chronic illness that would often make it difficult or impossible for me to read novels.  Reading has always been something I enjoy, and was a major escape for me even at the start of my illness, so losing access to books hit me pretty hard.  I figured out that I didn't have trouble with audiobooks or graphic novels, and so ended up switching over to entirely audiobooks and webtoons for a while.  *The Demon's Bargain* by Katee Robert (which fills my Novella square) was the first physical book I was able to read in a long time.  Though I'm now able to read novels more consistently, there are still times when I want to read and just can't.   ",Fantasy
1711938830.0,2023 Bingo mini reviews (complete card even though I only found bingo in January),"&#x200B;

[My card](https://preview.redd.it/aei7q3xmwprc1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=fea4f61a3cd9d54c750954ca296679c60b146a6d)

I found r/Fantasy and learned about bingo in early January, so a lot of my card is backfilled with things I read before then.  Despite the short timeline, this was definitely a worthwhile experience for me and I'm looking forward to participating next year with a bit less time pressure.  Bingo definitely gave me an incentive to read things outside of my comfort zone, some of which I enjoyed, and also helped me identify some gaps in my reading habits.  It's been fun!  

My reviews range in length and content.  Any spoilers are marked as such.  Webtoons are denoted and everything else is a book (except for the short stories).  

**Title With a Title -** *Cursed Princess Club* by LambCat (webtoon)

* This is one of my favorite webtoons and I'm really sad that it's now complete because I don't get to read new episodes any more.  I don't think I can do it justice, but it's a really well done comic that I think a wide range of audiences would enjoy.  It doesn't take itself seriously until it needs to, and then does a really good job of it.  Some of the major themes are identity, love (mostly not the romantic kind), and self-acceptance.  Also, the whole ""cursed princess"" thing is an allegory for disability, which I somehow completely missed the first time I read it.  It would definitely get 5 stars from me if I was doing star ratings.

**Superheroes -** *Heroine Complex* by Sarah Kuhn

* Didn't love it, didn't hate it.  Might check out the rest of the series eventually.  I found it to be too predictable.  If you're looking for a light read about friendship, growing up, and the pressures of fame, it'd be a good pick.

**~~Bottom of the TBR~~** **Witches (substitution from 2021 bingo) -** *The Witch and The Bull* by Moonsia (webtoon)

* Really didn't expect this to be the category I'd use a substitution for, but somehow actually finding a book that's been on my TBR for a long time proved quite difficult.  As far as webtoons go, this one had been on my list for a while before I actually started reading it a few months ago and very nicely matched the 2021 Witches square, so it felt like a fitting replacement.  I've enjoyed reading the first 3 seasons and am excited to see how the story will continue in season 4 whenever it releases.

**Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy -** *The Gray House* by Mariam Petrosyan

* I don't think I've ever read another book that was this weird and confusing.  I'm still unsure if I liked it.  I'm also unsure if I really understood it.  I think I'm done with magical realism for a while.

**Young Adult -** *A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking* by T. Kingfisher

* Just finished this a few hours ago (cutting it close, I know).  I really enjoyed it!  I often get frustrated with YA because the characters are very 16 years old and I am not, but this doesn't have that problem and is just such a fun story.  I'd definitely recommend it.

**Mundane Jobs -** *Faerie Fallen* by Carol Beth Anderson

* On a planet far from Earth (yes really), a faerie is sent (glamoured) to tutor a human teenager in the Fae language.  If you think that sounds like the start of a romance story, you're not wrong, but this book has so more much depth than I was expecting.  Ignore the romance and read it for everything else, but maybe wait for the sequel to be released first because this does end on a cliffhanger.

**Published in the 00s -** *The Eyre Affair* by Jasper Fforde (published 2001)

* I've been meaning to read more of Fforde's work ever I read *Shades of Grey* some time in high school, but somehow never did.  When I saw his debut novel at a bookstore and realized when it had first been published, it somehow felt like fate.  Definitely a bit of an odd book, but one that had me smiling and laughing at the wordplay and cleverness of the prose.  It was a fun and unique story that never stopped moving and only took as much time as it needed to be told.  I think it would make a perfect breather in between long books.

**Angels and Demons -** *180 Angel* by King Katbird (webtoon)

* I ended up with a lot of things I read this year to choose from for this square (what can I say, I'm a sucker for characters with wings), but ultimately decided to go with this hidden gem from webtoon canvas (self-published) because it's a great story that I'm surprised hasn't gained a bigger following.  I think it really starts to hit it's stride about halfway through season 1 (the season 2 finale just dropped).  The setting is far from unique (you really can't get more classic than heaven, hell, and earth), but the creator has really put his own spin on it with fun little details and the story feels fresh and exciting.  It's about growing into adulthood as much as anything else and I've been enjoying joining the main character as she figures out more about herself and who she wants to be.  

**Five Short Stories -** all from Uncanny Magazine

* *Lily, the Immortal* by Kylie Lee Baker - my husband sent me this one.  As someone with chronic illness who has been struggling with my own identity, this hit really close to home and made me cry a bunch.  I loved it.
* *Tower* by Lane Waldman - probably my least favorite out of these five.  >!It's a retelling of Rapunzel and has more than one story within just its one story.  !<I'm not sure if I really got it.
* *The Tailor and the Beast* by Aysha U. Farah - this was a lot of fun, everything I never knew I wanted from a retelling of Beauty and the Beast.  Highly recommend.
* *A Recipe for Hope and Honeycake* by Jordan Taylor - what a sweet little story, definitely felt fairy tale inspired despite not being one.  It made me feel all warm and nice inside and I teared up at the end.
* *A Piece of the Continent* by Marissa Lingen - stopped before I was ready for it to end, which was exactly when it was done.  If this was expanded into a novel, I'd read it.  My only complaint was a triflingly small quibble: >!The narrating character is ostensibly from the Boston area, yet uses the term milkshake to refer to what the rest of the country calls a milkshake (contains ice cream, known as a frappe in Massachusetts) instead of what we in Massachusetts call a milkshake (no ice cream).  I should not care this much and yet, as a lifelong Bostonian, I do.!<

**Horror -** *The Wicked and the Willing* by Lianyu Tan

* I really don't like horror almost ever.  In most cases, I'm either bored or very, very freaked out (like to the point where it keeps me up).  Yet when I went to backfill, I somehow already had two choices for this square.  The other was the webtoon ""Everything is Fine"" by Mike Birchall, which I like much better than this one.  Go read that, it's a great story.  A lot of why I picked this one for the square is that I have so much to say about it.  It's set in 1920's Singapore and the author did a great job of really immersing me in the time period (I assume she did a lot of research to get it historically accurate, but I don't otherwise know anything about the setting, so don't blame me if you do and you read this and it's all wrong).  Some of the events in the book were deeply horrifying and often portrayed in a way that helped emphasize how wrong they were.  I couldn't figure out whether I liked the book for most of the time I was reading it, but thought I liked it was it got towards the end, and then I hated the ending and once I got to it, I realized that it was why I had been so unsure about the book.  Explanation of why is below with spoilers.
* >!This is a fantasy romance novel and there are two different endings the reader can pick between, each with the MC ending up with a different person.  It's not a bad concept for a book, however, it meant that neither of those two relationships got developed properly prior to the ending.  I also didn't realize this had two possible endings until I got to the point where I had to pick, so I spent a lot of the book confused about who the MC was supposed to end up with (in romance, usually it's clear who the love interest is within the first few chapters).  This was all also all the more frustrating because one of the endings was clearly correct!  Full on spoilers now, the choice is between the very abusive vampire mistress and another servant who had mostly been friendly.  The story actually did a pretty good job of showing the MC growing to like and trust the vampire mistress and then slowly revealing just how dangerous and abusive she was, in parallel with showing the MC build a close friendship with the other servant.  Towards the end of the story, the other servant presents a plan for them to escape together, but the MC refuses to go until she is almost killed by the vampire mistress and only then opts to leave.  It's honestly such a nice story arc about recognizing and leaving an abusive relationship and some karma even catches up with the vampire mistress.  But then the vampire mistress finds them a few days later and that's when the book presents the ending choice.  And yes, I picked the correct option with the other servant, but this book was so close to being amazing and the existence of the other ending was what held it back.  I could've loved it, but instead I'm just frustrated. !<

**Self-Published or Indie Publisher -** *Aurora's Angel* by Emily Noon

* Hands down my favorite book I read this year.  It was recommended to me by someone in r/RomanceBooks in reply to my post asking for books with winged characters and it had almost everything I mentioned liking.  The story was immersive and set in a rich world that included both unique and familiar elements.  In particular, I enjoyed the creative and thoughtful details about different types of animal shifters and the dynamics between them.  The characters in the book felt realistic and nuanced, as did the way the relationship between the main characters progressed throughout the story.  I can't believe that a book I loved this much is someone's debut novel and I'm eagerly awaiting whatever Emily Noon decides to write next!  

**Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF -** *The City of Brass* by S.A. Chakraborty 

* I enjoyed both this book and the sequel, and am looking forward to finishing the trilogy soon (I'd be done if I hadn't needed to read a few other things for bingo before the month ended).  The book does a great job of slowly revealing things to the reader as the main character learns about them.  Characters were typically presented as a whole people, such that I could usually understand and empathize to some degree even with the antagonists.  
* It also took an interesting path with character perspectives.  Spoiler free, different perspectives were used exactly as they should be to add depth and nuance to the world, characters, and plot points.  Minor spoilers, >!there are two narrating characters for most of the book, but they don't initially know each other and aren't even in the same location for much of the story.

**Published in 2023 -** *Fourth Wing* by Rebecca Yarros 

* My nomination for this subreddit's ""we love to hate"" book of 2023.   Personally, I loved it.  Couldn't put it down and finished the whole audiobook in like three days.  I haven't had a book catch me up like that in quite a while and it was fun the whole way through.  It felt like everything I loved to read in my teens and younger, but aged up for adult me.  It had dragons, school, secrets, love, friendship, and even invisible disability representation!

It might be a bit too dangerous for real life, but I'd watch it.  I'd definitely check this webtoon if you enjoy figure skating.  This is mostly a comfort read for me, though there is >!a stalker!< and depictions of injuries, so it's not entirely light.  

**Coastal or Island Setting -** *The Croaking* by echorise (webtoon)

* I started reading this for the characters with wings, but stayed for the mystery and intrigue.  I finally know what ""the croaking"" is now, so that's neat.  I've enjoyed getting to slowly understand both the world and each character's motivations throughout the story.  This webtoon does a particularly good job of showing character development, which I think is very impressive for the number of different characters that the story follows.  Also, it starts at a military academy, so if you read Fourth Wing, it's nothing like that.  

**Druid -** *The First Girl Child* by Amy Harmon

* It took me a while to finish this.  It moves pretty slowly and I was never sure how things were going to happen.  Couldn't figure out how much I liked the book until I was done and I think I enjoyed it, but probably wouldn't reread.   

**Features Robots -** *Space Boy* by Stephen McCranie (webtoon)

*  At 345 episodes, this is the longest webtoon I've read.  The art style is pretty unique, very 50's comic book, like Richie Rich or Archie or those ""house of the future"" posters.  The setting somehow feels simultaneously retro, futuristic, and modern.  One of the major themes is sense of self.  I don't know how to do a good job of explaining *Space Boy*, but it's a wonderfully thoughtful story and I've cried more than once while reading it.  

**Sequel -** *Death's Abyss* by SD Simper

*  The title is excessively dramatic for the story in this book and I didn't think it really fit.  I read all three books in this trilogy back to back and can't remember where the events of book 2 ended and where the events of book 3 (this one) began.  It's about merfolk, love, a princess, and a corrupt monarch.  Also religion?  The series honestly wasn't super memorable.  Find a list of trigger warnings if you want to read it.  

&#x200B;

Personal note: Really didn't expect ""Bottom of the TBR"" to be the category I'd use a substitution on, but I somehow don't really have a functional TBR?  I've had two things majorly change my reading habits in the past few years, the second of which was the start of a chronic illness that often prevents me from reading novels (so I switched to mostly audiobooks and webtoons).  None of my audiobooks or webtoons have been in their respective TBR lists for all that long, even most of my physical books haven't been on the list for all that long (plus I can't reliably actually read most of them), and everything older that I could think of was from when I was in high school or younger (more than 10 years ago).   - and out of the two physical books, one is contemporary and the other is book 4 of a series that I need to reread first and have lost book 1 of (and no, they don't have it at the library).

Running the numbers for squares on my bingo board:

* 7 that I completed in the last 10 days of March (most were started much earlier)
* 6 filled by things I read specifically for bingo
* 2 books I started a while ago, but finished specifically for bingo
* 1 book finished on March 31

Medium-specific numbers:

* 3 physical books
* 5 online short stories
* 7 webtoons
* 14 audiobooks

As a personal note, I'm really happy that I was able to read three physical books for bingo this year.  About a year and a half ago, I developed a chronic illness that would often make it difficult or impossible for me to read novels.  Reading has always been something I enjoy, and was a major escape for me even at the start of my illness, so losing access to books hit me pretty hard.  I figured out that I didn't have trouble with audiobooks or graphic novels, and so ended up switching over to entirely audiobooks and webtoons for a while.  *The Demon's Bargain* by Katee Robert (which fills my Novella square) was the first physical book I was able to read in a long time.  Though I'm now able to read novels more consistently, there are still times when I want to read and just can't.   ",Fantasy

**1. Title with a Title  – The Witness for the Dead by Katherine Addison**

>I adored The Goblin Emperor when I read it (and I still want a direct sequel with Maia as the MC again), so I knew I had to pick this spin-off up. Celehar, with his interesting profession, was a side character from the first book that I wanted to know more about. It was amazing to watch him grow and recover from his trauma over the course of the book, and gaining new allies, all while solving a multi-faceted mystery.

**2. Superheroes – Vicious by V.E. Schwab**

>Another book I've been meaning to read for a while, but I'm just not a big superhero girly. The morally grey characters absolutely made this book. With each time jump I was left wondering who I should be rooting for. The entire concept behind the powers and where they come from is amazing. It got a little angsty at times, but was still great.

**3. Bottom of the TBR – Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson**

>My very first Sanderson novel! I've been meaning to pick this up forever, and I'm so glad I did. I loved this and I really hope it gets that sequel eventually. The characters and the magic system were definitely the best part. My only complaint was that the ending felt a little rushed.

**4. Magical Realism – Bunny by Mona Awad**

>This was a fever dream of a book. I think I enjoyed the ride and all the commentary, but it was pretty confusing, especially the ending.

**5. Young Adult – A Study in Drowning by Ava Reid**

>I picked this up on a whim and it was a pretty good time. The atmosphere was the best part for me. I don't know if all the topics covered (mental illness, sexism, racism, etc.) were handled perfectly, but it was still good. It turned out to not be the most memorable read for me.

**6. Mundane Jobs – Legends & Lattes by Travis Baldree**

>I was worried to pick this up because of all the hype, but it turns out that sometimes that hype really is warranted. This book hit just the right cozy vibes without being boring. Watching Viv grow over time and creating new friendships (and a romance) was heart-warming.

**7. Published in the 00s – The City & the City by China Miéville**

>Suffice to say I've never read anything like this; the premise, the prose, the setting, and the genre-bending weirdness all combined together to create this one-of-a-kind novel. It was definitely harder to grasp than many other speculative fictions works, at least to me. My main complaint is that the characters felt a bit flat, but everything else made it well worth the read. 

**8. Angels and Demons – Small Miracles by Olivia Atwater**

>This book was absolutely charming, and I loved the characters so much. The vibes were immaculate. I'm so glad the bingo put this on my radar.

**9. Short Stories – The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories by Ken Liu**

>I struggled to get through this. Not because it was bad, but because it was devastating. Do not let the cover fool you, the real-world atrocities and events in Asia that inspired these stories will gut you. All the Flavors and The Man Who Ended History: A Documentary were my two favorites.

**10. Horror – Comfort Me with Apples by Catherynne M. Valente**

>I was so obsessed with this little book. After I finished it I spent forever researching the inspiration (which I can't get into cause spoilers). The twist is soo good. Just an incredibly written feminist piece that I adore. It's a shame the Goodreads rating is so low.

**11. Self or Indie Published – Bitter Medicine by Mia Tsai**

>The character work was not my favorite. Both main characters felt bland and did not act like the near-immortal beings they were supposed to be. They felt young and inconsistent. I also found Tony to be an absolutely insufferable character who annoyed me whenever he got page-time. Honestly, I felt a lot more empathy for the little brother in comparison to the other siblings. I also think the pacing felt off. I liked the premise and initial world-building a lot, just not the execution.

**12. Set in the Middle East – The Jasad Heir by Sara Hashem**

>I really didn't think I was going to enjoy this book when I picked it up (fantasy with a dose of enemies-to-lovers romance), but I wanted to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did! It made my top 10 reads last year. I thought Sylvia as a main character was great, and watching her grapple with her identity and the expectations of everyone around her was fascinating. Her journey of learning how to love and trust other people again made me so happy. I really liked the side characters, the banter, and the world-building, though I found the magic system a bit confusing. The dialogue was just a hair cringey and over-the-top at times, but I loved it all the same.

**13. Published in 2023 – Ink Blood Sister Scribe by Emma Törsz**

>This was a little bit of a letdown, despite being good. After seeing all the glowing reviews and the excitement of the FIF book club, I expected this to be incredible. I enjoyed the Nicholas/Collins duo best of the characters which is unfortunate considering most of the focus is supposed to be on the two sisters. I also definitely preferred the pacing of the second half over the first. As far as plot, I do think everything went a little too neatly/easily, and it resolved so quickly. Don't even get me started on the insta-love with Joanna that felt right of a YA novel. I liked the writing and the world-building a lot though.

**14. Multiverse – Recursion by Blake Crouch**

>I've been meaning to pick this book (and Dark Matter tbh) up forever. The concept of this book is just amazing. It had me pretty mind-fucked for a while. The ending dragged a bit and the writing wasn't my favorite. The main character was also pretty grating at times. Still, 10/10 for an original concept.

**15. POC Author – The Mimicking of Known Successes by Malka Ann Older**

>I'm getting ready to pick up the sequel to this one! I loved the lesbian detective duo in space concept. I found a lot of the language and some of the world-building a bit confusing. Mossa and Pleiti carried this book, and I actually don't remember the mystery very well at this point. Still a good read.

**16. Book Club – Small Spaces by Katherine Arden**

>I don't read a ton of middle-grade, but this was pretty fun. I've always hated scarecrows, so this was perfect for me. The main character is grappling with grief and having a hard-time at school, all while dealing with horrifying scarecrows (and more).

**17. Novella – Walking to Aldebaran by Adrian Tchaikovsky**

>This book was a bit too British for me. There were definitely some sentences that may as well have been in anther language. The entire concept of this book (and that ending, holy shit) are incredible. I would definitely recommend this book. There were just some things that didn't quite work for me as far as writing and the MC goes.

**18. Mythical Beasts – Untethered Sky by Fonda Lee**

>The writing was beautiful, and my primary issue with this work was simply that it was too short. I would've loved more time with these characters rather than the multiple timeline jumps. If this had been a full-length stand-alone novel it would've been near-perfect. Also, I got to have my copy signed by Fonda Lee at a local book event!!!

**19. Elemental Magic – Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo**

>Definitely a hard book to get through as an adult, but I think if I'd read this when I was younger I would've enjoyed it more. It definitely feels young, and in 2024 it's not going to be as interesting. The magic system is nice enough, and the (sometimes poorly done) Russian inspiration was a unique take. The characters left something to be desired.

**20. Myths and Retellings – What Moves the Dead by T. Kingfisher**

>I am a T. Kingfisher stan to be honest. This was an incredible retelling of The Fall of the House of Usher. The whole unique nonbinary gender concept (with a nonbinary MC) in this novella was fascinating. It was sufficiently horrifying (ugh fungus). The characters are just so much fun. I already read the sequel too, and it was almost as good!

**21. Queernorm Setting – The Bone Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart**

>My last read for the bingo and thankfully it was a huge win. The magic system and world-building is unique and fascinating. The characters are pretty interesting, especially Lin. The twists had me jaw-dropped. I saw a few coming, and others just astounded me. I can't wait to read-on with the series.

**22. Coastal/Island Setting – The Bone Ships by R.J. Barker**

>The main character of this one could sometimes get on my nerves, but it was good seeing his growth. We also love an older, bad-ass female character 'round these parts, so Lucky Meas stole the show. The concept of the bone ships was awesome. I'm not usually one for a ton of action, or even pirates to be honest, but this one was definitely a winner.

**23. Druids – Becoming a Druid by Mike Mollman**

>I liked the nature themes and aspects of the magic system. However, the main character could be too unlikeable at times. The deaths of some of the characters didn't have weight; it felt very brushed over by our main character in particular. Also, the pacing felt choppy, like we were just jumping from one scene to the next.

**24. Robots – Exit Strategy by Martha Wells**

>This series is one of my absolute favorites. I can't say much about this book without spoiling the others, but I just love Murderbot as an MC so, so much. Sometimes I find a robot a little too relatable. The writing, plots, and characters within this series are perfect.

**25. Sequel – The Golden Enclaves by Naomi Novik**

>The first book in this series is one of my favorite books hands-down, but I found this last book to be the weakest. I didn't like where the story went and the characters that were focused on. I did enjoy the ending thankfully.

1711934342.0,2023 Bingo Card," This is my first year participating! I should have kept notes on all the books throughout the year but since I did not, I will highlight a few:

**Superheroes**: The Power by Naomi Alderman. The women of the world have electric powers and have taken over the world! I liked how this book was written from different perspectives including one male perspective. Like with many speculative fiction books it really makes you think about whether this “could be'' one of our futures.

**Bottom of the TBR**: Bunny by Mona Awad. I’ve had this on my list for a while after reading a bookriot post about books in school settings. The book was a wild ride. If you like to be 100% sure about what happened after reading this book is not for you. I personally don’t mind a little mystery and confusion but I read this in a book club and it was split with either people really liking it or absolutely hating it.

**Angels and Demons**: Daughter of Smoke & Bone by Laini Taylor. Most of the books that filled my card were books that I read this year that I was able to fit into a category. However, I had to go looking for a book to fill this square. I'm glad I came across this one from the recommendations thread because I really liked it - especially for a YA. I plan on finishing reading the series.

**Set in the Middle East**: The Queue by Basma Abdel Aziz. This book was a struggle for me. It could have been a DNF except it was the last book I needed to fill the card, so I powered through. In hindsight I realize it might just be that the topic was stressful for me. A major focus of the book was that the government had control over approving whether citizens could have access to certain medical care (exams, surgeries, etc.). With what has been happening in the US in the past couple of years regarding women's health I think it was just too stressful to read for me.

Can't wait to plan for next year!  Link to Bingo Card: [https://imgur.com/a/IJUNyZ0](https://imgur.com/a/IJUNyZ0)

1711926812.0,2023 Bingo Card: All Short Fiction Edition,"###About This Card:
   
Usually for Bingo I focus on a primary card, with no particular theme, and then when I finish it, I start on a second more thematic card, and see how far I can get. Somehow this tricks my brain into not getting too tripped up by the theme. 
  
This year, I found that I was reading even more short story collections than usual. I was trying to read more short fiction in general, especially novelettes, which I love but rarely seek out. I was having a great time participating in the [Short Fiction Book Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1bp1lwg/short_fiction_book_club_presents_monthly_short/). 

And during all of this, somewhere in my fevered brain a really stupid idea was forming: could I fill an entire card with short stories, novelettes, and novellas?	

I won't be submitting this card officially or reviewing everything I read, because the pure amount of material makes that impractical. But I thought it would be fun to share my thinking/planning for each square, and some of the highlights from my reading.   
   
###The Rules I Decided I Must Follow:  

It was very important to me to make sure I was reading a full novel's worth of short fiction for each square. I came up with a few guidelines to help rein in the madness:	

- I decided that if I read a full anthology or collection, I would count it as a complete square, regardless of the book's length. However, I did keep an eye out to make sure I wasn't accidentally choosing a bunch of short books.   

- I decided that with anthologies, I could skip up to one story if I was really struggling to get through it, and still count the square as complete. Remarkably, this only came up once.	

- To abide by the ""can't repeat authors"" rule, I decided that if I read multiple stories by a single author (outside of a collection), they'd all have to count for the same square. Any stories that I read but which didn't fit the selected square weren't counted towards the card.	

- I decided that I wouldn't exclude an entire anthology that happened to include a contribution by an author I had already read for another square, as long as I didn't know that author was a contributor ahead of time. As far as I know this only happened twice.   

- I did some rough math/word count estimates to figure out the number of short stories, novelettes, or novellas I would need to read to consider a square ""complete."" Broadly, I decided that for each square, I'd need to read 1-3 novellas, 4-6 novelettes, or 12+ short stories, or some combination thereof.   

- I thought that I'd probably end up reading a bunch of stories that didn't make the card because they turned out not to fit a square, which 100% happened. I decided that all the extra stories I read more than made up for any short-ish squares.  

- I chose not to care about or track Hard Mode for this card. I'm deranged, but not that deranged.  
   
###And Now For the Card!!	

**Title With A Title:**	

For this square, I read 2 novellas, a novelette, and a bunch of short stories.  
  

Standouts:  
- The Last Dragoners of Bowbazar by Indrapramit Das (novella)  
- Princess Floralinda and the Forty-Flight Tower by Tamsyn Muir (novella)   
- ""Fear of the Pan-Child"" by Robert Shearman (short story)  
  

**Superheroes:**   

I really struggled with this square on my regular card, but lucked out on this one. I read **The Refrigerator Monologues** by Catherynne M. Valente and loved it.   

I am very hit or miss on Valente, but this one was a slam dunk for me. Do you want to feel angry and yet validated for your feelings about how women in comic books are frequently treated as disposable objects, there only to be murdered or maimed horribly in order to facilitate the story of the male hero? Seek catharsis in this fantastic collection. It won't work for everyone but I loved it.  

**Bottom of the TBR:**	

This was an easy square for me; I have a towering stack of collections on my TBR. I went with **Get In Trouble** by Kelly Link, which I've been meaning to read since it came out in 2015. It was good but not amazing.	

**Magical Realism/Literary Fantasy:**	

This square was harder than I thought it would be. I tried several collections that didn't hit for me. Luckily I saw somebody on here post a review of the collection **The Adventurists: and Other Stories** by Richard Butner. This was a very interesting book and I'm glad I read it. Along with this collection, I also read another 10 or so short stories from the various books I tried before finding this one.	

**Young Adult:**   

I started out reading one off short stories for this and quickly realized it was going to be very difficult to find enough random stories to complete the square. Instead I decided to read the three most recent novellas in the **Wayward Children** series by Seanan McGuire. I had dropped this series after a few disappointing entries, and I'm really glad I picked it back up.  

Standouts:  

- **Lost in the Moment and Found** by Seanan McGuire (novella)  

**Mundane Jobs**: 	

For this square I read one novella, 2 novelettes, and a bunch of short stories.  
Standouts:  
- ""The Thing About Ghost Stories"" by Naomi Kritzer (novelette)  
- ""Better Living Through Algorithms"" by Naomi Kritzer (short story)  
- ""City So Bright"" by Dale Bailey (short story)  


**Published in the 2000s:**

For this square I read **Tales From Earthsea** by Ursula K. LeGuin. I lucked out with this too; I was already doing a full read through of the Earthsea series, and I was thrilled when I realized this was published in 2001. It was, of course, excellent.   

**Angels and Demons:**	

This square caused me serious problems. There weren't any themed anthologies that appealed to me and nothing on my TBR fit. I started out trying to read one off stories and quickly discovered that it's really hard to find random short stories featuring an angel or a demon. At some point I had an epiphany: *fan fiction*. I decided to make it easy on myself and just read about my favorite TV demon, Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I don't really like slash so I used a gazillion filters to try to find some stories I would actually like. Shockingly, this worked. I read three novella length fanfics, all of which I enjoyed and one of which was truly excellent and very unexpected. A Bingo miracle.   

**Short Stories:**   

I filled this square with one off short stories which didn't fit any other squares or which only fit a square I had already completed. I read 2 novelettes and 18 short stories, and then stopped counting.  
   
Standouts:  

- Accidental Girls by Chloe N. Clark (short story)
- Set Yourself on Fire by Sam Kyung Yoo (short story)

**Horror:**   

For this square I read **Dark Tales** by  Shirley Jackson, which was absolutely phenomenal. Not all of the stories were speculative but enough were that I thought it still counted. I also read a handful of one off short stories to fill out the square.	

**Self-Published/Indie Press:**	

For this square I read **Boys, Beasts & Men** by Sam J. Miller. Damn, this was *incredible*. I will definitely be reading more of his work. I was blown away by this book.   

**Middle East:**   

The first thing I read for this square was a very mediocre collection of stories based on folktales from the Middle East, author and title redacted to protect the guilty. It was short and didn't feel sufficient to me, so I decided to tackle **The Annotated Arabian Nights: Tales from 1001 Nights**, translated by Yasmine Seale. The stories are fascinating and the translation is *beautiful*. However, it is a very long book. I didn't finish it, but I got about halfway, and since it's 816 pages long, I decided that was enough to call this square complete.   

**Published in 2023:**   

This was another very easy square. I was trying to keep up with current short fiction in order to be ready for Hugo nominations. Another case where I just stopped counting once I had read 20 stories. 

Shout out to ""A Year Without Sunshine"" by Naomi Kritzer (novelette), which I loved but couldn't count for the card, since I already used two Naomi Kritzer stories for the Mundane Jobs square.	

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities:**   

For this square I read one novella, one random short story, and a whole bunch of stories from two different themed anthologies: **Oz Reimagined: New Tales from the Emerald City and Beyond** edited by John Joseph Adams & Douglas Cohen and **The Other Side of Never: Dark Tales from the World of Peter & Wendy** edited by Marie O'Regan and Paul Kane. Both of these anthologies were fairly flawed, with a few highlights but enough misses that I knew I wouldn't be reading the whole anthology. Instead I just read the stories I found compelling. I also assigned a few of them to other squares they fit into, once I was sure I had read enough to complete this square.	

**POC:**   

For this square I read **The Wishing Pool and Other Stories** by Tananarive Due, which was fantastic. I also read a handful of short stories before deciding to read a collection instead. 

Shout out to ""Time Lock"" by Davian Ow (short story), which ended up being one of my favorite short stories of the year.   

**Bookclub/Readalong:**

The square that launched ~~a thousand ships~~ this Bingo card! I really wanted to read more short stories this year, so I made a solemn vow to participate in as many Short Fiction Book Club sessions as I could and hopefully broaden my short fiction horizons. Then I offered to lead a session, and then I got involved in the behind the scenes planning, and then I read about 700 phenomenal short stories, and then the idea of this beautiful yet monstrous card was born.

I participated in 9 SFBC sessions total, and read 65,000+ words worth of stories (5 sessions) before I considered the square complete and stopped officially counting.  

Standout sessions/stories:  

- [Oops, All Isabel J. Kim](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/18xlflx/short_fiction_book_club_oops_all_isabel_j_kim/)  

- [Locus Snubs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1b819ut/short_fiction_book_club_locus_snubs_2023/)  
  
- [Spooky Season](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/17lcqwj/short_fiction_book_club_spooky_season_descent/)



**Novella:**   

This is the one square where I allowed myself to just read one thing and not worry about it being too short. A novella is a novella, sometimes they're short! 

I read **Nothing but the Rain** by Naomi Salman, and it was absolutely fantastic. It was short, but it packed so much depth and meaning into its page count. One of the best things I read all year.   

**Mythical Beasts:**   

For this square I read one novella, three novelettes, and 8 short stories. 

Standouts:

- The Dream-Quest of Vellit Boe by Kij Johnson (novella)
- ""On the Fox Roads"" by Nghi Vo (novelette)   

**Elemental Magic:**   

For this square I read **Elementary**, an anthology edited by Mercedes Lackey. All the stories took place in Lackey's ""Elemental Masters"" series universe, and were written by different authors, some well known and some not. Lackey herself contributed one story as well. 

Unfortunately, this book did not work for me at all. I actually liked the idea of the series quite a lot, and I'll definitely give the novels a go at some point. But oof, these stories. I just wasn't vibing with most of them, and found a lot of the writing amateurish, dull, and predictable. I had to check the book out 3 separate times to get through it. In a normal Bingo situation I would have DNFed it in a heartbeat, but I couldn't find anything else that fit, and I already knew I'd be using my square substitution elsewhere.	

Even my beloved Tanya Huff couldn't save this anthology for me, although I did enjoy her story, which was a bright ray of light in a dark, vast sea of despair. Of the 19 stories in the anthology, I read 18 and enjoyed a grand total of 3. Sorry to this book but damn, it was extremely not for me.	

**Myths/Retellings:**   

For this square I read a glorious chonker of a book, **The Collected Enchantments** by Theodora Goss. I had never read Goss before and was delighted to discover this wonderful compilation of stories and poems from across her long and varied career. I was initially intimidated by the length (600 pages!) but it flew by. Goss is incredibly good at interpreting and retelling fairy tales and folk stories, often with a sharp new perspective that changes your interpretation of the original story. I really loved this and Goss is an insta-read author for me now.   

**Queernorm:**   

For this square I read **The Shorter Parts of Valor** by Tanya Huff. This is a collection of short stories that take place in her ""Confederation"" universe. I'm not usually huge on military sci-fi, but I passionately love this series - it's an all timer for me. I was delighted to have any excuse to read more in this world. I enjoyed this collection immensely.  

This book was on the shorter side, so I  read a novella by another author to fill out this square. I really disliked it, so I'm leaving it unnamed.   

I got a kick out of the fact that Tanya Huff ended up in the Queernorm square on both of my cards. Well deserved, as she has been writing queernorm settings since before queernorm was a word.   

**Coastal Setting:**   

For this square I read one collection of interlinked short stories, one novelette, and four short stories. 

Standouts:  

- Arboreality by Rebecca Campbell (collection)  

- ""You Are Born Exploding"" by Rich Larson (novelette)  

- ""LOL, Said the Scorpion"" by Rich Larson (short story)   


**Druids:**   

Well, this square was A Journey (non complimentary). I tried to find a themed anthology that would fit. I'm not an Iron Druid fan so that was out. The only other anthology I found looked terrible. I spent $1.99 on a massive anthology of Merlin stories and painstakingly noted every single story that seemed to have Druidic vibes...but I couldn't get into any of them. I tried an anthology of nature magic stories...same. By this point I was desperate. Could lightning strike twice? I went to my favorite fan fiction site and typed in ""druid"". Oh right, Merlin is a show (that I have not seen). Maybe some of those would work? After trying 6 stories in 3 fandoms, I gave up for good, and decided to substitute the square. 

After looking through a variety of previous squares, I decided the funniest possible option was to use **Two or More Authors** from 2022. Could one argue that this is cheating? Yes. Do I have even a sliver of remorse? I do not. I read **When Things Get Dark**, an anthology of horror stories inspired by Shirley Jackson and edited by Ellen Datlow, and called it a day. 

**Robots:**

For this square I read 4 novelettes, 1 short story, and, as part of my full Murderbot reread, 5 novellas.  
 
Standouts: 

- ""Dave's Head"" by Suzanne Palmer (novelette)  

- Murderbot! ❤️

**Sequel:**

For this square, I read **Deeds of Youth** by Elizabeth Moon. This is her second collection of short stories that take place in the Paksenarrion universe. I did a full series reread this year and this was a fun way to finish it. Most of the stories were previously published, but I hadn't read any of them before. Not the place to start with this series, but very fun for those of us who already love Paks.

###And In Conclusion

And that's it! I can't believe I actually finished this card. This was an incredibly fun and challenging project. I wasn't sure I'd be able to finish it, especially when I hit a few especially tricky squares, but I'm so glad I persevered. I read an absolutely incredible amount of short fiction and had a total blast doing it. I'm definitely planning to try to complete an all short fiction card again in 2024.

1711925131.0,A world in which you can't hide your emotions for some reason?,"Okay so guys- in The Stormlight Archive, there are spren that are attracted to emotions, like there are these little creatures who gather around when certain things are happening. For example there are painspren which look like orange little hands coming out of the floor, they appear around you when you feel pain, or there are angerspren that look like little puddles of blood and they appear when you're angry. Now of course the worldbuilding for spren goes deeper than this, and also some kinds of spren are rarer etc. but I was thinking today and realised how absolutely hard it would be to live on Roshar because of those spren. Imagine having a crush, the whole world knows it now. Or imagine you just go around in town with little exhaustionspren coming after you. Or when you achieve something gloryspren come around you LIKE THAT'S EMBARRASSING DUDE GO AWAY. Ehem anyway- so I was wondering if there is any other worlds like this? Like in which you just can't hide your emotions, it is made known for some reason? I just thought if there's anything else like that, this subreddit would be the place to ask, although I don't think there really is lol.

Of course, it is good when characters show development/have to develop themselves to overcome adversity, but progression fantasy seems like it blows this trope completely out of proportion.

So what's the deal with its popularity?

TL;DR:

**Fave prompt:** Coastal - I like a cool setting. 

**Least fave prompt:** Druid, which I swapped.

**Fave book** Features Robots: A Close and Common Orbit by Becky Chambers

**Least fave book** Mythical Beasts: Assistant to the Villain by Hannah Nicole Maeher**

Yes Ice planet Barbarians was better than Assistant, I'm just as shocked as you.

Visual card: https://imgur.com/gallery/CyaUSnB

**Title with a title - Prince Of Thorns by Mark Lawrence**

The craftsmanship and intricate character work of this books deserves 5 stars, especially as a debut novel (who hurt you, Mr. Lawrence?😱), but I was utterly horrified the entire time and the 1st half felt meandering, so I lowered the rating a bit. I don't talk about plots much in my reviews, but I'll say Jorg, the titular prince, is a rotten cinnamon bun. Yes you heard me! This was a raw exploration of nature vs nurture and Jorg shows us how his past has shaped his present, sometimes in such gruesome detail that it was hard to keep reading

**Superheroes - Upgraded by Blake Crouch** HM

I basically read this in one sitting, it's a thrilling page turner and raised a lot of questions on humanity, what rights we have to chage the world how we want, and so many typical Blake Crouch moral dilemmas I wouldn't even know how to start listing them. I did connect less to the main character that in other Blake Crouch books, but iykyk.
The pacing was very messy. It started slow, then ramped it all up to 11 and the final few chapters it just... felt odd. Like the author ran out of time to write, but also like a chapter was fully missing. 

**Bottom of the TBR: Assassin's Fate by Robin Hobb**

I don't want to talk about it...I've been preparing for this final page since I started the series in 2019. Fitz and the Fool are beyond a simple book review.  I'm torn and at peace simultaneously.

**Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy: Circe by Madeline Miller** HM

I could not put this book down. Although not my usual epic fantasy pick, the craftsmanship poured into this novel is remarkable.  I can always find something to nitpick about and this time it was such a smooth yet rocky journey. Circe certainly made me look at some parts of my life in a new way and isn't that the point of stories? To help you grow and mature and understand others. Needless to say I recommend this, it is like nothing I have ever read and I struggled to stop reading to go to bed.

**Young Adult: The Golden Enclaves by Naomi Novik** HM

This is book 3 of the Scholomance so I will be vague. While I enjoyed the serie, El's development in particular and I found the relationships to be endearing (especially in book 2), this final book was too convoluded for me and could have used a lot more finessing or exploring. It is a satisfactory ending and some parts are truly horrific, but I'm not likely to reread.

**Mundane Jobs: House in the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune** HM

Someone should have warned me how wholesome and sweet and heartwrenching this book is. It was a a moment of levity amongst all the grimdark and the depressing choices I made for bingo and I adored the pure little friendships, moments of joy, and shy gentle growth of Linus. I had a smile on my face the entire time. I cried, I laughed, I got angry and sad and glad.

**Published in the 2000s: Stories of your life and others by Ted Chiang** HM

The author is entirely too smart for my intellectual capacity. I first tried his short story Liking what you see for the ""5 short stories"" prompt, and enjoyed it so much I decided to continue. This collection I thought was high quality prose and conceptS, but a bit of a mess in terms of consistent style and enjoyment. Apart from Story of your life and Tower of Babel which moved me, the rest of the stories were somewhere between self-congratularoty and obnoxious.  Ted is a very talented writer and if his intention was to infuriate me and dislike his protagonists, then he did a fantastic job.

**Angels and Demons: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman** HM

Interesring premise, disappointing execution. Absurdist fiction just isn't for me. I think this was hyped to no end and mostly because of the tv show chatter I had vastly different expectations of the narrative, meaning I assumed we'd get a LOT more Crowley and Azuraphale and much fewer 1-5 page pov chapters from characters I didn't care about and would never make another appearance.

**5 Sff short stories:**
*When the Yogurt took over - by John Scalzi*
That left a sour taste in my mouth. Mostly because it's a recipe for some weird ChatGPT AI desaster that's getting so close to reality we might get to see it happen in our lifetime.

*The ones who walk away from Omelas by Ursula K Leguin* 
This was very sad and depressing. The writing style was odd, so many words for a single line of import. It does raise important questions about utopias and social responsibilities, but it was entirely too long just for that one disturbing line. 

*Bloodchild by Octavia E Butler*
Disturbing and disgusting. Idk if I can recommend this. Do not read it while eating chips and salsa, like this idiot.

*Mother of Invention by Nnedi Okorafor*
Eerie and surprisingly heart-warming. I would lile a full novel on this, for an 19 page story it pacled a punch and opened my appetite for more African-futurism.

*How to talk to girls at parties by Neil Gaiman*
I'm entirely too stupid to understand it. Something about poetry and aliens and how girls are like aliens to teenage boys. Skippable.

**Horror: At the mountains of Madness by HP Lovecraft**

Great imagination, poor storytelling. This read exactly like a scientific paper and it gave me identical emotions: boredom and fatigue. I'm not sure why this book was written, I don't even know the narrator's name, let alone experienced any character development.  An endless telling instead of showing, an overwhelming repetition of descriptions or ""this thing cannot be described by mere words"". 

**Self pub: NPCs by Drew Hayes**

Quick fun read. This was pretty much a classic D&D campaign with a few twists. While it's not a bad story to play out in a campaign irl, not sure it worked that well as a novel. I won't continue the series, but I do recommend this for any D&D newbies wanting to get more familiar with play and tropes.

**Set in the M.E.: The Arm of the Sphinx by Josiah Bancroft**

Pirates! Steampunk! Zoos! Libraries!
I wish I hadn't done this in audio, not because the narration isn't great, it is, but because the plot, fantasy terms, politics and non linear storytelling got me quite confused at times (same for book 1). The moment I switched from audio to physical it went from 3 to 4.5 stars. So yea hard to rate. But this is another very unique book, I enjoyed the new povs and how all actions have consequences. The worldbuilding is exquisite, the characters' growth earned and the reveals are scream-worthy (damn that ending!).

**2023: Starter Villain by John Scalzi**

Very fast read, really fun and it played with some tropes in ways I found refreshing and delightful. Truthfully this didn't go in the direction I thought it would, it was definitely a humorous/ parody story instead of an anti-hero story, which is my bad as I didn't take the cue from the silly cover!!! 

**Multiverse: Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins** 

Brutal, gory, horrific, at times funny, maybe a bit odd and certainly imaginative. And then we get to the last 25% and it is indeed weird. It went from a fast paced page turner of a mystery to a convoluted brain bending overexplained slog. I did like the idea of these ""overpowered with knowledge"" people be studying some very peculiarity specialties and wish we could have gotten more pagetime around that, and less around the mental and physical torture.

**POC: The 7 Moons of Maali Almeida by Shehan Karunatilaka**

This book made my heart bleed and I cannot recommend it enough, while simultaneously not being able to recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to suffer alongside Sri Lanka's victims of war and circumstance. If I did have to critique something, it's that I was a bit overwhelmed by details, names, factions and the unknown politics of Sri Lanka's 90s. The confusion was increased by the added supernatural subplot which was ultimately the driving force behind this ""whodunit"" (and I do apologise, it's much more complex than this, but it is the instigating element).
 
**Readalong: Emily Wilde's Encyclopedia of Faeries by Heather Faecett** HM

Surprisingly delightful, although nothing revolutionary. The first half of this book was quite dull and DNF-worthy. I only finished it for book club but after half way it got decidedly more interesting. The highlight here was the interesting portrayal of the ice fairies and the side characters who did have their own little lives and added some much needed dimension to a traditional girl meets fairy prince tale.I disliked the plethora of fairy stories dotted throughout the narrative, while I understand they had an exposition role, they pulled me out of the story.

**Novella: Elder Race by Adrian Tchaikovsky**

It was good. A concept I'm sure we've all thought about at some point and wanted to write a book on it. This particular book is perfectly adequate. Sorry this review isn't more helpful.

**Mythical Beasts: Assistant to the Villain by  Hannah Nicole Maeher** 

Utter garbage. Unreadable.  Nothing about it was fun, cute, witty. I could genuinely write a novel myself detailing all the ways in which this wattpad toilet paper material is full of nonsense, but I have better things to do. Sorry but booktok doesn't know sh*t about quality books. Skip this book like it has rabies.

**Elemental Magic: Eye of the World by Robert Jordan** HM

A summary of EotW:
- 200 pages of peasants cussing each other
- 20 pages of gory murder
- 400 pages of walking
- 20 pages of epic exposition and planning
- 160 pages of walking *in the dark*.

I hated most of it for how slow and repetitive the prose was. But Lan and Moiraine made it worth powering through. I'll only continue the series via Rosamund Pike's audiobook.

**Myth or retelling: Thornhedge by T Kingfisher** HM

This was a very cute, charming Sleeping Beauty retelling, but with all the right twists.Toadling reminded me why kindness is a quality I value so much, with her self sacrifices and her heart too big for her tiny toad body. She was witty, caring and selfless. The family dynamics were the most endearing aspect to me, highlighting how you can always find belonging amongst kin not of your blood.

**Queernorm: A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine**

Unique, confusing, deep and eloquent. Unlike anything I have ever read. Is it weird now I want an imago too? The mystery element of this story kept me interested the entire time, and all else revolves around this plot: the worldbuilding, the political intrigue, the ... slam poetry. This suffered a bit from tell instead of show, usually books havetoo little dialogue for my taste, in this case it was too much. And entirely too clever for my puny brain 😅 I would classify this as an intellectual speculative fiction ode in space. Not so much Pew-Pew Scifi.

**Coastal Setting: Tress of the Emerald Sea by Brandon Sanderson** HM
 
Cutesy, but this was just ok. Along with Frugal, I am not a fan of the non big Cosmere stories so far. I think this particularly is NOT a good entry point into the Cosmere and whomever says otherwise is delusional.  I read my fair share and found it often confusing, trying to keep track / reverse engineer the magic system to check it is correct, which took me out of the story often. Part of my liking this less than Mistborn and SA (yes I love them, let me be!), was because Hoid was the narrator and I found his arbitrary witty nonsensycal commentary irritating. Tress was a lovely character, this reads like a cute fairy tale and overall I'm satisfied with both the journey and the ending. The humour was a miss.

**Druid: swap with 1st person POV from 2021: Ice Planet Barbarians by Ruby Dixon** HM

A book that made me laugh even though that probably wasn't the intention. What can I say, this is alien erotica, it did what it needed to do fairly well. It's not my typical genre so I never expected it to be amazing. I will give it credit as it does have a proper plot and some decent worldbuilding. But hea the writing was atrocious and the heroine's pretty blaisé attitude about *not being on earth* was quote jarring, as was her total lack of care regarding her Earthen life. Also there's a r*pe scene so heads up on that. Can you believe the alien smut out-ranked the medieval romantasy? How embarrassing. 

**Features Robots: A Close and Common Orbit by Becky Chambers** HM 

What a charming, cozy read!I knew this series was all about the character interactions and found families, and this did not disappoint. I've always been fascinated by the morality and humanity of AIs ever since watching that very old film with Robbin Williams, Bicentennial Man, which absolutely broke my heart. The characters were endearing and especially Sitra the AI had a very realistic joirney, the worldbuilding was delightful as well, with quirky rituals and a surprisingly well handled view of gender and social roles (without being too hamfisted!).I'll happily recommend this book to fans of TJ Klune and anyone who likes a cozy yet heartfelt slice of life story.

**Sequel: Dresden Peace Talks by Jim Butcher** HM
 
This is book 16 so I will try to be vague. I don't know what happened with this story. It is obviously a book cut in half so rating and reviewing this one without Battle Ground seems pointless. All I can say for now is that it just seems a big set up and nowhere near as entertaining as previous Dresden stories. The Lara sexy googly eyes got really old really fast. I got over this quirk of Harry's early on, accepted it as part of his character flaws, but whenever there's a major Vampire plot in these books, this seems to be soooo prominent. Still one of my favourite series.

Sorry this is so long 😅",Fantasy
1711915162.0,Looking for a specific recommendation :),"Greetings

I'm looking for fantasy books/ series that has elements of main characters starting weak and getting stronger and stronger over the course of the story, kind of like in shonen animes (Naruto, hunter x hunter and the like), but unlike shonen I want it to be ""mature"" and less on the childish side.

Now, I know lots of books fits in this niche, so I'm looking for the ones that also kinda feel believable and gripping.

1711913912.0,"The Deities of Lankmar, Fritz Leiber and Bloodborne","So I've started reading the stories of Fhafhrd and the Gray mouser stories and I was wondering about the deities he mentions, especially Kos. Having played bloodborne I was really surprised when I saw it. Is it a coincidence, Bloodborne was referencing Leiber, or Leiber took the name from some other mythos. From my understanding having read only Swords against Death is that even though he is inspired by Lovecraft the deities are his own.

A lot could be lost in translation, and I don’t know how was Leiber’s Kos was translated into japanese, but according to bloodborne wiki ‘’The Japanese name for Kos is 'ゴース' or, some say, 'ゴスム'.’’ So I guess if it is not from Cthullu mythos it could be a reference to Leiber if they share the same japanese name.",Fantasy
1711912477.0,2023 Hard Mode Bingo Card - Wrap-up,"This is my second year completing my Bingo Card, and my second year doing hard mode. I planned out a lot of my books in the first couple months so it wasn’t too difficult to find something for most of the squares. I had my card 90% complete by November and then got distracted with other books in my TBR so I still had two squares left to finish at the beginning of March. 

I really enjoy all the new books and authors that I find while completing a card. I never really read horror, but ended up reading three this year. 

I’m not great at reviews so here’s my books and a quick thought on each. Next year I’ll have to write these as I go, as I’m trying to remember things about all the books from the last year.

# Row 1

# The Strange Case of the Alchemist's Daughter, Theodora Goss [Title with a Title] [HM Not a title of Royalty]

Dr Jekyll’s daughter Mary joins together with Sherlock Holmes to solve her fathers mysterious past. Along the way she meets and befriends the daughters and creations of a secret society: Beatrice Rappaccini, Catherin Moreau, and Justine Frankenstein. A fun story weaving through and crossing over the various Victorian era fantasy. 

# The Refrigerator Monologues, Catherynne M. Valente [Superheroes] [HM Not related to DC or Marvel]

The stories of six female superheroes who have all been “Refrigerated”. A term used to describe women characters who were killed off or put through terrible ordeals just to progress a male superheroes storyline. I enjoyed the book and thought it was a great reminder to keep your eyes open when reading.  

# Blindsight, Peter Watts [Bottom of the TBR] [HM]

The book follows the crew of astronauts on a mission to investigate an alien artifact discovered near earth. I think I’ve delayed my hold on this book in Libby for a couple years before diving into it for this square. It was crazy, and dense, and took re-reading portions to try to take it all in. I did enjoy it even if I’m still not sure what all happened.

# The Night Circus, Erin Morgenstern [Magical Realism] [HM Not in the linked thread]

A magical competition between young illusionists, with the mysterious circus the backdrop and game board. I loved the descriptions of all the rooms of the circus. I did get lost here and there with time and pov jumping and that probably would improve on a re-read.

# The Last Graduate, Naomi Novik [Young Adult] [HM Published in last 5 years]

We go back to the Scholomance for El’s final year as she and the other students try to make it out alive. I read A Deadly Education last year for bingo, so this was a great square for me to continue the series. It’s fast paced, dark and crazy. This book ends on quite a cliffhanger, so have the third book ready to go!

# Row 2

# The Mimicking of Known Successes, Malka Ann Older [Mundane Jobs] [HM Does not take place on Earth]

A murder mystery taking place on the rail platforms of Jupiter. It starts small and builds throughout to big stakes. It was short but entertaining and enjoyable. 

# A Shadow in Summer, Daniel Abraham [Published in the 00s] [HM Not in the top 30 of best of 2023 list]

Political intrigue, betrayals, and powerful spirits held captive and used by poet-sorceres. I’m a huge Expanse fan so it was great to read more of their solo works. I liked the visual communication system along with the dense word building and magic system. I really look forward to reading more in this series.

# Lent: A Novel of Many Returns, Jo Walton [Angels and Demons] [HM The protagonist is an angel or demon]

Lent follows a Dominican friar in Renaissance Florence who grapples with his beliefs and the consequences of his actions. I thought it was ok. Once the returns began I started to get into it more, but it never really grabbed me like a lot of the other books on this card. 

# The Far Reaches [Five SFF Short Stories] [HM Entire Anthology or Collection]

Hard Mode being a whole anthology and the anthology I picked has six books… Not exactly cheating for hard mode but I’ll find a bigger anthology for next years square to make it up to myself.

* How It Unfolds, James S. A. Corey
* Void, Veronica Roth
* Falling Bodies, Rebecca Roanhorse
* The Long Game, Ann Leckie
* Just Out of Jupiter's Reach, Nnedi Okorafor
* Slow Time Between the Stars, John Scalzi

# Build Your House Around My Body, Violet Kupersmith [Horror] [HM Not King or Lovecraft]

Following the intertwining stories of three women across different time periods in Vietnam. There is a lot going on in this book. There were a few threads that I was waiting for but never saw paid off, and I think my focus on those took away some enjoyment. 

# Row 3

# City of Bones, Martha Wells [Substitute Square] [2018 Stand Alone] [HM Not in same universe]

I was having difficulty finding a book for the Self-Published or Indie Publisher square and as the month was coming to a close I decided to substitute this square for a book that I had already read. I wish this book wasn’t a stand alone because I love the world building and characters.

# The Daughters of Izdihar, Hadeer Elsbai [Middle Eastern SFF] [HM Author is of Middle Eastern heritage]

Following two main characters from vastly different backgrounds; Nahel a waterweaver from a well off family but forced to marry to pay off her fathers gambling debts. Giorgina is an earthweaver with no control over her powers but works with the Daughters of Izdiahr, a radical women's rights group. It was pretty good. The magic ended up being kind of repetitive for elemental fantasy, and the characters didn’t really seem to grow. It’s a two part book so I knew it wasn’t going to have much of an ending, and instead just set up the second. 

# Natural Beauty, Ling Ling Huang [Published in 2023] [HM Debut Novel]

A piano prodigy, who has to give it up to support her parents after a debilitating accident. She finds herself thrust into a new job at a high end cosmetics store and the privilege it offers. But slowly unfolds the sinister truth. I don’t really read a lot of horror but several ended up on my card this year. It had some pretty crazy moments and I think it was really good. 

# The Space Between Worlds, Micaiah Johnson [Multiverse] [HM Characters do not walk through a literal door]

Travel between multiverses is possible, but only if your duplicate is already dead. Cara finds herself a valuable “traverser” as she has died on most worlds across the multiverse. Overall I liked the book. I liked the take on the multiverse, only being able to travel if your other self no longer inhabited that world. There was a lot that was left up to the reader to figure out on your own, which worked in some places and left me terribly confused in others. 

# Noor, Nnedi Okorafor [POC Author] [HM Takes place in a futuristic Sci-Fi world]

Following the story of AO, a self adopted moniker ‘Artificial Organism’ for all of her body augmentations, who must go on the run after an altercation and everything goes wrong. She meets a herdsman named DNA and they escape together across the desert. I liked the story. A lot happens in a short story, so it’s a whirlwind at times. Not as strong as Remote Control that I read last year, but another good take on Afrofuturism.

# Row 4

# Things in Jars, Jess Kidd [Book Club or Readalong Book] [HM Current Selection and participate in the Discussion]

A historical mystery set in Victorian London. What starts as a simple investigation into the disappearance of a young girl delves deeper into a web of secrets and a host of peculiar characters. I really liked the story as it was built. It was fun to take part in the discussion along the way, I should do that for more read-along books. I wanted a little more satisfying revelations for the characters near the end, some of it kind of fell flat after wanting to find answers for the whole book.  

# The Employees: A Workplace Novel of the 22nd Century, Olga Ravn [Novella] [HM Not published by Tordotcom Publishing]

Crew members above a ship grapple with existential questions and interpersonal dynamics after taking on a number of strange objects from a new planet. The book is a series of interviews where we only read their responses of the crew. The story was very abstract and meant for you to have your own take on the experiences.

# The Last Unicorn, Peter S. Beagle [Mythical Beasts] [HM No dragons]

A unicorn sets out on a quest to discover if she is truly the last of her kind. I enjoy mixing in some older books in my bingo cards, and I was glad that I chose this one for the Mythical Beasts square. It’s a solid and fun fantasy tale. 

# The Rise of Kyoshi, F.C. Yee [Elemental Magic] [HM Not Shades of Magic or Codex Alera series]

Set in the world of Avatar: the Last Airbender, this is the second book in Avatar Kyoshi’s journey. The universe of Avatar is so fun that it is great to get these deep dives into characters we don’t get a lot of time with in the show. 

# What Moves the Dead, T. Kingfisher [Myths and Retellings] [HM Not Greek or Roman Mythology]

A retelling of Edger Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher” our protagonist is Alex Easton, a retired lieutenant who comes to help their dying childhood friend Madeline Usher. They must unravel the secrets of the House of Usher before it consumes them. 

# Row 5

# No Gods for Drowning, Hailey Piper [Queernorm Setting] [HM Not futuristic setting]

The Gods have left and the sea and its creatures are threatening to take over the city of Valentine. Meanwhile a serial killer is ritually sacrificing victims trying to lure back their God. Kind of all over the place. Had some interesting ideas but didn’t really execute them well. 

# A Wizard of Earthsea, Ursula K. Le Guin [Coastal or Island Setting] [HM Also Features Sea-Faring]

A classic Hero’s journey story with lots of adventure and introspective. I always enjoy Ursula Le Guin books and this was good. I had a harder time starting the book with being told he’s the most powerful wizard, and then start off being insufferable. It's a good book and I need to get on reading the rest of the series to get the whole journey. 

# Drowned Country, Emily Tesh [Druids] [HM Not The Iron Druid Chronicles]

Years after the story of *Silver in the Wood*, Henry and Tobias are brought back together in a seaside town where an ancient wood once stood to help Silver’s monster-hunting mother in a case of a missing girl. I thought the first was better, but this had enjoyable moments. It’s not quite long enough to fully develop all the characters and enjoy the worldbuilding that Tesh writes. 

# Sea of Rust, C. Robert Cargill [Featuring Robots] [HM Robot is the protagonist]

A post-apocalyptic world where robots have taken over after the fall of humanity. What a fun and wild ride. I loved the back and forth between the current action and the history of what led to the robot revolution. Despite all the characters being AI robots, everyone was unique and interesting. 

# Blackflame, Will Wight [Sequel] [HM Book 3 or more]

I’m slowly making my way through the Cradle series and this was a good one. I like the expanding universe and more POV characters to set the bigger stage.",Fantasy

1711909148.0,2023 Bingo Retrospective with Stats!,"Phew! That was close! I honestly thought I wasn't going to make it in time but managed to finish my final book yesterday! 😅

So this is my 4th time participating in the bingo and 2nd time  completing the whole card. Below are my thoughts on each book and some general stats. Let's dive in!

# Thoughts

**Title with a Title** **—** ***Hex of the Witch*** by Heather G. Harris

>This series has kinda become a comfort read for me. It’s a self-pub urban fantasy series featuring witches and a slow burn romance.

**Superheroes** **—** ***Hench*** by Natalie Zina Walschots

>I’m torn on this one because it started as if it would deconstruct superhero tropes which was promising but went to a whole different place which was disappointing.

**Bottom of the TBR —** ***Invisible Cities*** by Italo Calvino

>Did you know that Marco Polo actually had a travelogue that documented the cities he visited and the time he spent with Kublai Khan? Learn something every book. Anyway, this was an interesting read, though I’m sure a lot of it just went over my head. Some of the cities reminded me of my own city.

**Magical Realism —** ***Sea of Tranquility*** by Emily St. John Mandel

>My second book by Mandel. It didn’t hit me as hard as *The Glass Hotel* did but I still enjoyed the exploration of topics it focused on.

**Young Adult —** ***The Thief*** by Megan Whalen Turner

>The first half of this book, which was needlessly long and exasperating, almost made me throw in the towel. Did we really need that many pages to establish and familiarise with the characters? No, we did not. Also, Gen’s characterization didn't seem consistent and his petulance came across as annoying rather than endearing. Not sure if I will continue with the series.

**Mundane Jobs —** ***Six Wakes*** by Mur Lafferty

>This was such a wild ride! A generational starship, fascinating technologies, interesting characters, and a murder mystery as cherry on top! In the crew we have a doctor, an engineer, and a general maintenance/cleaning/cooking worker. Writing seemed a bit clunky though at both sentence and paragraph levels, mostly at the beginning. 

**Pub in the 00s —** ***Ozanın Şarkısı*** by Göktuğ Canbaba

>This book is by a local author from my country. The title can be translated as Song of the Bard or The Bard’s Song (I know lol). It’s a standard epic fantasy with an ensemble cast and a main quest. It was supposed to be the first book of a series but no sequels have ever been published as far as I know. There were some serious issues with writing and editing which killed my enjoyment but it also made me feel nostalgic for this sort of fantasy.

**Angels & Demons —** ***Even Though I Knew the End*** by C.L. Polk

>Not a big fan of noir but I did enjoy this one since it didn’t have the distasteful tropes of the genre. Though I’ll admit I couldn't get invested in the main relationship as much as I’d hoped.

**Short Stories —** ***I’d Really Prefer Not to Be Here with You, and Other Stories*** by Julianna Baggott

>My one and only 5 star book on this card. It was such a thought-provoking and emotionally packed collection. There are fifteen stories in total in a wide range of genres that explore themes like identity, memory, and family. I've been going through a period of severe existential crisis, contemplating things like life and death, existence and non-existence, consciousness and memories, and some of these stories really hit hard, as in made me ugly cry. Highly recommended.

**Horror —** ***Dead Silence*** by S.A. Barnes

>*Titanic* meets *Event Horizon!* The first half of this book was just *chef's kiss*. It was incredibly creepy and atmospheric and did a great job at building the sense of dread. I read those parts mostly in bed at night and let me tell you, it wasn't easy at all to go to the bathroom in the dark! The second half, however, left a lot to be desired. Also, the romance angle was unnecessary and should have been cut out. The writing itself was decent, if a bit repetitive. That first half, though. Damn, I loved that so much.

**Self-Pub —** ***Murder on the Lamplight Express*** by Morgan Stang

>I really liked *Murder at Spindle Manor* but I’m torn on this one. First, I have a problem with Isabeau in this book. Replace her with a random cynical and stoic man, of which there are copious amounts in fantasy, and nothing would have changed. It's understandable she was like that in the first book because she was a lone wolf back then, but here she's still the same. Heck no, she’s even worse. There's no depth, no personality to her anymore. Second, there was a notable decline in writing. Weird sentences, repetitions, missing words, extra words... all of which grated on my nerves. Third, some parts made me cringe so much, ugh. On a positive note, the murder mystery was gripping, there were so many twists and turns, and we learned some more about the setting.

**Graphic Novel (2018) —** ***Bloodlust & Bonnets*** by Emily McGovern

>My substitute for the Middle Eastern square. I was reading *The Queue* by Basma Abdel Aziz for that but it made me so sad and angry that I couldn't read more than a few pages in one sitting and realised I wasn’t going to finish it in time. Anyway, this graphic novel features badass characters, vampires, and Lord Byron himself! Some of you may know Emily MvGovern from her *My Life As a Background Slytherin* comics and so if you like her style, I’d say give this one a try.

**Pub in 2023 —** ***A House with Good Bones*** by T. Kingfisher

>I really like Kingfisher's brand of humour. This one didn't really feel like horror though. It was more like a thriller or suspense for the two thirds building a growing sense of dread and then went crazy wild in the last third. I also found the bits about archaeology and entomology fascinating, even though I'm not a bug person.

**Multiverse —** ***Piranesi*** by Susanna Clarke

>My first book by Clarke and it gave me a lot to chew on. Piranesi's kindness and empathy, his sense of wonder, his reverence for the House and harmonious existence within it touched me deeply.

**POC Author —** ***The Mimicking of Known Successes*** by Malka Ann Older

>I really love unique and imaginative sci-fi settings such as this one. Rings and platforms around Jupiter sound cool af! Mossa and Pleiti definitely give Holmes and Watson vibes but Pleiti is way smarter than Watson, that's for sure lol. No idea why this is billed as romance, though. I felt like there was no chemistry or attraction between the leads and I'd prefer they remained friends. Also writing was a bit weird at times on a sentence level and I had to reread some sentences more than once. Imagining the environment in my mind was also a struggle. I’ll still check out the sequel though.

**Book Club —** ***Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries*** by Heather Fawcett

>What I truly loved about this book was the portrayal of fairies. Malevolent and trickster fairies, dangerous bargains, rituals and traditions… I found it all so fascinating. As for the characters, dealing with Emily's social awkwardness on top of her rigid academic approach was a struggle for me. She was just so formal and serious and flat all the time it became tiresome fast. Wendell Bambleby was much more relatable to me, and also more fun and interesting compared to everyone else. The romance was the least convincing part and added nothing to the story. As an aside, this book helped me pinpoint a pet peeve of mine in romance. I really don't like it when the woman is the shy and inexperienced one, having maybe one or two relationships in the past, while the man is quite the womaniser whose dalliances are known by everyone including the woman herself. Ugh.

**Novella —** ***And What Can We Offer You Tonight*** by Premee Mohamed

>This writing style didn't gel with me at all. Paragraph long sentences and so many commas everywhere. That is not how you do stream of consciousness. And it keeps telling, not showing. Also, social commentary was surface level, like rich people can do whatever they want and the rest of us peasants ain't worth shit? Yeah, tell us something we don't already know.

**Mythical Beasts —** ***Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*** by J.K. Rowling

>This one is a big sized hardcover in my native language with illustrations that I bought years ago. I would have given it a higher rating in the past but it’s been a long time since the illusion shattered and I lost the feeling of magic of the Harry Potter world. Now it all seems so cheesy with all those ridiculous names and weird conventions. Like how exactly do these magical creatures are cared for on such a massive scale? And how in the world can Burkina Faso, a country that is ruled by violence and military coups where 40% of the population lives under the poverty line, have a ministry of magic? I didn’t like the illustrations either, they were so mediocre and forgettable.

**Elemental Magic —** ***Into the Labyrinth*** by John Bierce

>As far as magical school books go, this one is fairly straightforward and even predictable, but I had fun with it. I'm an absolute sucker for elemental magic and here we have much more than the basics. I believe this is what people would call a hard magic system since it has spellforms, mana channels and whatnot. Writing was a bit too repetitive at times and I also noticed several typos here and there. It's possible that this book didn't go through an editing process, considering it's a self-published title, but even a single round of editing would have helped smooth out the rough edges.

**Retellings —** ***Heart of the Moors*** by Holly Black

>Disney's Sleeping Beauty is one of my childhood favourites and holds a special place in my heart and I also love the first live action *Maleficent* movie. This book presents an original story set between the two movies. It was my first book by Holly Black but I can't say I'm impressed with it. I know this is a young adult book but the writing is too simplistic and the overall tone is too juvenile. It tries to be serious and dramatic but comes across as kinda cheesy. Also there were too many references to the events of the first movie but they felt clumsy and heavy-handed. The only thing I liked was Maleficent’s portrayal.

**Queernorm —** ***A Prayer for the Crown-Shy*** by Becky Chambers

>I should have loved this duology because one, it features a post-capitalist world where societies are built and work humanely and two, the philosophical musings resonate with me as I've been struggling with similar questions myself. Sadly, that didn't turn out to be the case, and I believe the main reason for that is Dex. Mosscap is just delightful to be around and I would happily spend hours with it watching trees or discussing books, but Dex is just so cold and bland I’d probably feel bored to death if I got stuck with them on the road. I get that these characters are foils to each other but Dex as our window into this world didn't work for me. Another reason could be that the philosophical stuff was a bit too on-the-nose for my liking. What a shame. Crown shyness is so cool though.

**Coastal —** ***The Changeling Sea*** by Patricia A. McKillip

>A lovely tale, beautiful and bittersweet, full of wonder and magic. This was my first book by McKillip. I'd been curious about her works because her name always comes up whenever someone asks for recs with good prose. While she didn't exactly mesmerise me with this book, I can see that she has a way with words, which is something I appreciate and very much enjoy in books. Looking forward to reading more from her.

**Druids —** ***The Druid and the Dragon*** by Kristin Butcher

>Another lovely tale with a sense of wonder, magic, and adventure. What baffled me in this story is that druids act as teachers, seers, and bards. They provide moral and spiritual leadership, settle disputes among common folk, and give guidance to kings. How cool is that?! Turns out that is how it was in ancient Celtic cultures, which I wasn't really familiar with if I'm being honest, and I absolutely loved it.

**Robots —** ***I, Robot*** by Isaac Asimov

>So Asimov can imagine a future where robots walk and talk and eventually run the world but he apparently cannot imagine women being more than nagging wives or being *both* feminine and intelligent. Sigh. Also, too many hot-tempered assholes. Interesting ideas on robots though.

**Sequel —** ***The Spirit of Solstice*** by Charlotte E. English

>This book is the 6th entry in my current number one comfort read series. It’s set in a secondary-world Victorian-esque city where it’s constantly cold and snowy. We follow Konrad Savast, who is the chief servant of a death god, while he investigates murder mysteries and carries out his master’s judgement. Each book has a self-contained mystery case and is about novella length.

1711907471.0,Dark Fantasy Recs,"On my second Red Rising re read. Love it. I’ve also read and love ASOIAF, LOTR, some of Dune and The Expanse.

Looking for something new that incorporates demonic like evil. It can be specifically related to Lucifer and Hell. Or not at all. Some evil demon like, monstrous evil. Or a horrifying alien threat. I’d rather not read a massive series like 10k+ pages. And it would be awesome if there was potential for a TV/film adaptation.

Really appreciate any recommendations in advance! ",Fantasy
1711907292.0,My first BINGO experience!,"I'd never participated in Fantasy Bingo before, and I have to say, it got me out of a huge reading rut. Here are my faves I discovered this year:

**The Memory Librarian:** I always get majorly skeptical about celebrity collaboration books, but I should have more faith in the artistic vision of Janelle Monae. I loved each story in this collection and the ways in which it grew the entire science fictional/fantasy world of Dirty Computer. 

**The Library at Mount Char:** I thought I hated horror, but it turns out horror-fantasy crossover stuff is totally my jam. Looking to read lots more this year.

**The Sparrow:** Maybe the most emotionally devastating book I've ever read. Don't be fooled by the glib ""Jesuits in space!"" synopsis, this is a treatise on the interplay between faith and despair that will get its hooks DEEP into you by the end.

**At The Mouth of the River of Bees:** I love short stories, and these were so beautifully written. Most involved animals in some way. All were unique and different. One was truly disturbing (if you want to skip that, it's the one about alien sex, you'll know it within the first sentence), and one involved a senior dog near death and made me weep. So glad Kij Johnson is on my radar now.

**Hiss** I was a beta reader for this contemporary YA fantasy/horror retelling of Swan Lake. It's gonna be a hell of a book, and I sure hope some agent scoops it up soon. I'm a sucker for a good cult, and a cult turning women into geese? Even better.

**At The Feet of the Sun:** I really liked The Hands of the Emperor, but this book made me absolutely fall head over heels for the two main characters. It's like a fantasy coming-of-age story, but for men of retirement age who've accomplished amazing things already and are now finding out who they are in this next stage of life. A witch says at one point ""They should send grown men on quests more often."" YES, PLEASE.

**Klara and the Sun:** I love a slow, sad, beautiful book. This is a slow, sad, beautiful book. What more can I ask for?

**Things I didn't love from my Bingo card, without naming names because all of them were perfectly fine books:**

I'm rarely a huge fan of magical realism, but I'm open to the idea that I just haven't found the right book for me yet.

I've come to realize that I'm more into mysterious magical forests than people with magical nature powers. Love nature magic, but druids just aren't my cup of tea.

I don't think any other angels and demons book will ever hold up to Good Omens for me. I hate that the bar is set so high, because I just end up disappointed so often.

**Things I've decided want to read more of**

* Weird narrative structures
* Smart people getting revenge
* Heists
* The power of poetry (metaphorical, emotional)
* The Power of Poetry (literal, magical)
* Detailed descriptions of ecosystems
* Unsettling prophetic children
* Mysteries (scientific or magical) that remain mysterious
* GROWN-ASS PEOPLE ON QUESTS

1711899513.0,Book Review: The Greater Good (Ciaphas Cain #9) & Old Soldiers Never Die by Sandy Mitchell,"The Imperial planet of Quadravidia has come under attack by the Tau. Commissar Ciaphas Cain arrives to advise on the defence of the planet, after several previous encounters with the untrustworthy species. However, the Tau call an unexpected ceasefire in the face of a greater, mutual threat: an incoming Tyranid Hive Fleet. Cain's mission moves from combat to diplomacy as he has to broker a deal between the Tau and Imperium - the latter not known for its interstellar diplomacy - and then help defend the planet from the new alien menace.

We're back in the mayhem with the ninth novel of Sandy Mitchell's **Ciaphas Cain** series, in which the grim darkness of the far future is alleviated by the presence of the most self-preserving and undeserved glory-receiving specimen in the Imperium of Man.

*The Greater Good* puts Cain's reputation front and centre as he has to negotiate a peace deal between the Imperium - whose entire ideology is ""shoot aliens in the face and never, ever talk to them,"" - and the Tau, a race dedicated to the somewhat nebulous concept of ""the greater good."" There's a degree of a comedy of manners here as the two species' highly incompatible ways of working clash with Cain trying to avoid war in the face of the greater Tyranid threat.

This stuff takes up a few chapters and then we're back to the battle front as bullets fly and large things explode spectacularly. Mitchell is accomplished at both the action and the black comedy sides of the setting (Cain sometimes feeling like the Only Sane Man in the entire barmy **Warhammer 40,000** universe) and serves up both with aplomb here. Particularly entertaining are the deranged human scientists who think experimenting on live Tyranids is a good idea (spoiler: it isn't) and the Space Marines who worryingly agree with them.

There's a nice amount of variety to the story, as it moves from diplomacy to grim humour to action, although it does feel some ideas are left under-explored, such as the human inhabitants of the Tau Empire and how they regard the Imperium from a human, outsider perspective. There's also the usual advice that, although the omnibuses are most economical way to enjoy Cain's story, it's perhaps a good idea to read other things between the books, as Mitchell is perhaps less concerned than other authors in the setting with varying his prose style or characterisation between stories.

Still, this is an exciting action story with some laughs and some brief moments of thoughtful discussion. *The Greater Good* (\*\*\*\*) is definitely one of the stronger entries to the series.

Also included in the *Ciaphas Cain: Saviour of the Imperium* omnibus is the long novella/short novel *Old Soldiers Never Die* (\*\*\*\*), which is a fast-paced zombie story as Cain and his trusty Valhallan allies find themselves stuck on a planet beset by a particularly nasty Chaos curse.

1711898028.0,New to genre looking for coming of age series?,"Hey guys!

So I’ve recently stumbled on series The Path of Ranger by Pedro Urvi and devoured the 20 books in a few weeks.

This is my first real binge into this genre and I really loved it. Especially getting to grow with the main character and all the fun magic and fantasy elements. 

I also liked the training, especially in a school (ranger camp) setting and the romance that did not completely overpower the main story line.

Has anyone read this series or have anything similar they would like to recommend?

1711871343.0,Review: The Hexologists by Josiah Bancroft,"Hello all, it's your local Literaturecult here with a new review! This time around I have chosen to look at the first book of Josiah Bancroft's first installment in his new series: The Hexologists (which is the name of both the series and the first book). So with the introduction out of the way, on with the review!  


**The Hexologists (book 1 of The Hexologists) by Josiah Bancroft** 

**Rating: 4.5/5.** Full of wit, a simple, yet intriguing, magic system, political intrigue out the gills, and laugh out loud moments. A worthwhile read for fans of sleuthing fantasy.  


**Full Review:**

This book had me hooked, from the premise, to the oddity of the magic, even reading about War's homely woes was great! The setting itself was reminiscent of an early electric age Britain, almost tail ending an Industrial Revolution, though this one was spurred by magic. Iz and War Wilby are a charming couple with a great chemistry between them, and other members of the books dramatis personae. All the characters (with slim exceptions) feel well rounded and have strong interactions with both the world, but also each other and the Wilbies, showing Bancroft's strength for inter-character relations and witty dialogue. The magic system is very simple to grasp, however it is also pretty deep, with multiple schools of magic seemingly based around art forms such as dancing, singing, and drawing, each of which has it's own magic teachings. As for the inciting incident, (which is mentioned in the synopsis) it all starts when the Wilbies are contacted to investigate the strange case of the king wishing to be baked in an oven. It's an odd premise, but it leads to a very fun romp and an intriguing political scheme, that said, the book dragged in small ways in the middle, and at times I felt disinterested in the POVs of either Wilby as they seemed to either focus too much on a small thing, or the constant worrying for each other, even if they aren't in imminent danger or 5 feet apart. That said, it does show how deeply Isolde and Warren love each other, even in the brunt of the magically odd, such as seemingly occultic entities they have brushes with. Overall, while I have some issues with it, the story as a whole had enough intrigue, whimsy, wit, and great worldbuilding to make it a favourite read of mine, and introduced to me one of my new favourite characters that I hope to see more of in future installments of the series.",Fantasy

1711843664.0,2023 Bingo Mini Reviews - Name and the Noun,"This started as my 3rd annual Midlle Grade Only board, but as I was pulling together ideas, I noticed a trend in the titles of a lot of my choices: *Shad Hadid and the Alchemists of Alexandria, Amari and the Night Brothers, Onyeka and the Rise of the Rebels,* etc. I decided it would be fun to fill the whole board with titles of the form *So-and-So and the Thing-a-ma-bob.* A few of the titles ended up with a different conjunction (of, in, vs.) but they all start with a name and end with a noun. While I didn't restrict myself to an age group, the title structure meant that, by far, the majority of my picks ended up as middle grade. Because of that, I include separate recommendations for kids and adults.

**Rating Scale**

5 - Loved it! Goes into my reread rotation

4 - Enjoyed it and will recommend it

3 - Didn’t love it, but still willing to recommend it

2 - Meh. Don’t really recommend

**A couple of tropes that bugged me this year**

*Incompetent Adults*

I’ve come to realize that if a book starring kids also includes a significant involvement from adults, I need at least one of them to be competent. The kids don’t have to use that competent adult and there can be bad adults, but please give me at least one complex, not totally terrible adult. Especially in a school setting!

*Secret Villains*

I am oversaturated with secret villains in the media. There were quite a few in my selections this year. A few handled them well, but some handled them badly and that turns me off a book completely.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vjsxtzf69krc1.png?width=901&format=png&auto=webp&s=49deae8081d3b532fb26bbcd384bf672097467bf

**1. Title with a Title - Not Royalty**

(3/5) *Amari and the Night Brothers* by B.B. Alston \[AR 4.9, 700L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Eh  \*Adults? Probably not

*Girl discovers she has magic powers and goes to special school to train and to discover what happened to her missing brother.* 

This is, unfortunately, the book that solidified my irritation with the above tropes, since it had both. I volunteered at the library at my kids’ school and this was hugely popular, so I was excited to read it. But the secret villain was obvious super early and all of the adults just made me want to strangle them, so I spent the majority of the book vaguely irritated. And then it ended with what felt like an unearned deus ex machina. Clearly a bunch of kids like it, but personally, if you are looking for a magic school with a black, female protagonist, *Onyeka and the Academy of the Sun* would be my choice. 

**2. Superheroes - Not Marvel or DC**

(2/5) *Chance Fortune and the Outlaws* by Shane Berryhill \[AR 5.5, 800L \]

\*Recommend to Kids? Probably not \*Adults? No

*Kid with no super powers fakes having powers to get into superhero school, where something hinky is going on.* 

Published in 2006, this is one of the earliest YA superhero books I found. And in 2006, I probably would have enjoyed it. But in 2023, post superhero craze, there isn’t anything here that hasn’t been done better since. The pacing is inconsistent and the exposition is a little heavy in places. It isn’t really worth going back to.

**3. Bottom of the TBR**

(4/5) *Paola Santiago and the River of Tears* by Tehlor Kay Mejia \[AR 5.9, 840L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes! Although my daughter cried when I explained the legend of La Llorona, so with some caution? \*Adults? Middle grade lovers

*Skeptic girl is forced to face the reality of mother’s superstitions when she must rescue her missing friend from La Llorona.* 

I’ve read a lot of Rick Riordan Presents books by now and there are a few familiar formulas, so I figured I would enjoy this, especially since I grew up in the southwest, but that I wouldn’t run into any surprises. So I was caught off guard by a midway moment about the importance of forgiving, not only others, but yourself, and giving yourself grace to grow. It was really powerful and I loved it.  

**4. Magical Realism OR Literary Fantasy - Not on the list**

(3.5/5) *Tamarind and the Star of Ishta* by Jasbinder Bilan \[AR 5.1, 810L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes \*Adults? Eh

*Girl visits dead mother’s family in India for the first time, trying to find answers and finding mystery instead.* 

I had a hard time rating this book. I liked it. I thought it was a realistic depiction of how grief and loss can impact a family. I loved the setting - a house in the Himalayas. I guess I just wanted a little more depth. It is a fast, easy read that felt like it was maybe a little too fast and easy for the subject matter? 

**5. Young Adult - Published in the last 5 years**

(3/5) *Artie and the Wolf Moon* by Olivia Stephens \[AR 2.4, HL520L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Eh \*Adults? Eh

*Girl navigates family relationships and history while discovering she’s a werewolf.*

I read this as part of the Great Library Read Along on Libby. The book was ok. I think it might really resonate with some teens, with the issues Artie is facing and her relationships with her mother and her peers.  I know a lot of readers like graphic novels. I just think this book wasn’t for me.

**6. Mundane Jobs**

(4/5) *Elizabeth Webster and the Court of Uncommon Pleas* by William Lashner \[AR 5.1\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes \*Adults? If you are looking for something a little different

*Girl helps a popular boy with his ghost problem by becoming a lawyer.*

Slightly creepy, while also educational! The legal proceedings are on point and the ghosts and demons and creatures can be legitimately scary. I like Elizabeth and her friends. The mystery surrounding her mother wasn’t quite as deft as I would have liked, but the stressors of a blended family were handled well. I’ll probably read more.

**7. Published in the 00s - Not in the top 30 favs**

(3/5) *Peter and the Starcatchers* by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson with Greg Call (Illustrator) \[AR  5.2, 710L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Sure \*Adults? How do you feel about Peter Pan?

*A prequel to Peter Pan; a seafaring adventure that gives backstory and completely changes Peter’s character.*

Since I read this back in 2004 and didn’t remember it well, I reread it in preparation for reading the sequel. And then I got to the end and remembered why I didn’t seek out the sequel originally. The story wraps up so well and sets up all the pieces for *Peter Pan* that I didn’t feel the need and wasn’t quite sure where a sequel would go. And while it was still a fun adventure, I have now read the original story and so any nice, kind Peter, like in this story, feels a bit disingenuous. A plus is that the pictures are fun and the chapter lengths are nice for a kid.

**8. Angels and Demons**

(4/5) *Pahua and the Soul Stealer* by Lori M. Lee \[AR 5.9, 840L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes \*Adults? Middle grade lovers

*Girl has to save her brother from demons with the help of an animal sidekick and new frenemy.*

I am not familiar at all with Hmong mythology, so this was a really informative as well as entertaining read. I liked how Pahua’s personality was built. The conflicts felt genuine and believable. There was a secret villain that worked for me since the anticipation of some sort of betrayal comes early and how it works out is satisfying. While I may not continue the series, it was a solid read. 

**9. Five Short Stories - An entire anthology** 

(4.5) *Girls and Goddesses* by Lari Don with Francesca Greenwood (Illustrator)  \[AR 5.8\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes, it would make a good read aloud. \*Adults? If you like myths.

*A collection of retellings of myths/stories from around the world where the girl or woman in the story was already the hero in the original.*

While the collection title didn’t match, the titles of 9 of the 12 stories did, so I decided it would work. My 5 favorite of those 9: 

* *Chi and the Seven-Headed Dragon* (Chinese legend) Very short but nicely humorous for a rather violent story. 
* *Durga and the Demon* (Indian myth) I wonder if this is the earliest version of ""I am no man!""
* *Tokyo and the Skin Rope* (Japanese legend) I love that even though Tokyo followed a different passion than her father, they respected each other and she takes to heart his philosophy to never leave behind someone who needs your help. 
* *Kopecho and the Two Suns* (Venezuelan myth) Like the author, I enjoyed a story that was not about bringing light to a world that was dark, but saving a world that has too much light. 
* *Aliquipiso and the Cliffs* (American Indian legend) Not quite as good as the others, I did think including a story with sacrifice was a nice touch. Not all stories end happily.

**10. Horror - Not Stephen King or H.P. Lovecraft**

(4/5) *Dr. Fell and the Playground of Doom* by David Neilsen \[AR 6.3, 910L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Those who enjoy the creepy. \*Adults? Eh

*Three kids have to save the neighborhood from the doctor’s evil playground.*

This was the only book where the name in the title is not the name of the protagonist, but the antagonist. Horror is not generally my cup-of-tea but this is still a middle grade book, so it wasn’t too intense. The book was suitably creepy, the over-the-top names added some humor, the kids each had a distinct personality that was deftly sketched with their actions and dialogue without deep explanations slowing down the pace. Well told and well written.

**11. Self Published**

(4/5) *Yumi and the Nightmare Painter* by Brandon Sanderson with Aliya Chen (Illustrator)

\*Recommend to Kids? No \*Adults: Yes, see notes about Cosmere connection

*A young woman and young man keep swapping consciousnesses, having to live each other's lives.* 

It feels a little cheap to use this here, but I did read all the secret projects and two fit my title structure. (My Druid square selection is indie published but I needed it for that square.) I liked this book. I’m a sucker for time loops and body swapping. I liked the back and forth. I, personally, was happy with the ending. It does feel like you probably need to have some understanding of the Cosmere to read it, but it’s a little hard to judge how it would go if you haven’t, since I have. 

**12. Set in the MIddle East - Author of Middle Eastern Descent** (one of 2 coauthors)

(4/5) *Baba Ali and the Clockwork Dijinn: A Steampunk Faerie Tale* by Daniella Ackley-McPahil and Day Ali-Mohamed

\*Recommend to Kids? Not young kids, but teens, yes  \*Adults? Yes!

*A steam-punk retelling of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.*

This was the kind of book I would have adored as a teen. I enjoy a good steampunk setting and I love a good retelling. The authors did an excellent job setting the scene. Ali himself is a lovely good-but-not-perfect hero. It was an enjoyable read and one I will recommend often. It is probably a little too explicit in its violence for younger readers. 

**13. Published in 2023**

(4/5) *Winston Chu vs. the Whimsies* by Stacey Lee \[AR 4.9\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes \*Adults? Maybe?

*With the help of his friends, a boy has to save his younger sister from a weird guy and his magical junk shop.*

This book was a lot of fun. I appreciated it being set completely in the real world, not a portal world like a lot of “save the sibling” stories. There are complex characters, especially the villains, which is not always the case with MG villains. The friend group is sufficiently filled out. The end wraps up nicely but still with room to grow. A solid read. 

**14. Multiverse or Parallel Realities - Not through a physical door**

(4/5) *Arlo Finch in the Valley of Fire* by John August \[AR 4.7, 670L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes  \*Adults? Possibly

*A kid moves to the mountains and joins a scout troop that learns to camp and fights monsters.*

I was surprised at how much I liked this one. As with many of the books here, there is an alternate magical plane of existence. But how mundanely that is treated by the rest of the characters was rather refreshing. There is no mysterious build up, no secret to be inducted into and kept. Arlo moves in and gets invited to join the scouts who are quite frank about what they do. I liked the team aspect. I thought Arlo was written maybe slightly younger than 12, but he is an anxious child, so it worked. There was plenty of setup for the continuing series, but not in a way that was annoying.

**15. POC Author - Futuristic, sci-fi world**

(4/5) *Onyeka and the Rise of the Rebels* by Tọlá Okogwu \[AR 4.9\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes \*Adults? MG fans, yes

*Book 2:  Onyeka, friends and trusted adults try to solve the superpower problem and defeat the bad guy.*

As mentioned, I preferred this series to *Amari.* I liked the first book and this was a satisfying sequel. A lot of story lines wrapped up without dragging on too long. I thought the character work was the strength of the first book and it was still strong here. There is a lot of focus on Onyeka’s internal turmoil, which is well written and well handled for its audience. 

**16. Book Club OR Readalong Book**

(4/5) *Shad Hadid and the Alchemists of Alexandria* by George Jreije 

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes \*Adults? Sure

*Boy mentored in alchemy heads off to alchemy school, where there is no alchemy?*

I held off on reading this last year because I was already done with my Bingo board and my choices for middle grade Book Club books were getting thin. My choice of theme for the board meant there were a lot of kid-discovers-magic-and-goes-to-secret-school books, which can get old. But this one was delightful! I adore Shad. I loved the alchemy and the practicality of the magic system. While bullies are commonplace in MG books, this bully felt different enough to be refreshing and I liked that there were a mix of villains who reform and villains who don’t. I will definitely continue the series.

**17. Novella - Not published by Tor**

(4/5) *Ruby Finley vs. the Intersteller Invasion* by K. Tempest Bradford \[AR 4.8, 710L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes. My 12yo daughter also gave it a 4. \*Adults? Possibly

*12 year old budding entomologist discovers a weird bug.*

I know this isn’t published as a novella, but at 37K words, it fits the technical definition. I read this as one of the Andre Norton Nebula award nominees and was so pleased when it won! It was a fun book and science fiction for middle grade often feels underappreciated when compared to fantasy. I liked Ruby a lot. I thought her neighborhood and the issues she was facing as a smart black girl felt authentic without being preachy or overbearing. I wish her friends had been a little more fleshed out and that we got a little more time with the aliens, but both of those would have required a longer book, and as a book for a younger middle grade reader, the current length feels right. 

**18. Mythical Beasts - Not Dragons**

(3/5) *Osmo Unknown and the Eightpenny Woods* by Catherynne M. Valente \[870L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Sure?  \*Adults? Maybe?

*Boy has to navigate the land of the dead with some ornery creatures to marry a mythological monster because the literal world can’t get along.*

I read this because it was a nominee for the Lodestar Award. It is my third book by Valente and I’ve decided, while I appreciate her skill, she is not my author. I have a hard time getting into her books; it took me almost a third of this book to really buy in. And while I know there are readers who will appreciate the weird and the allegorical, I found the characters hard to relate to and hard to like. A well written book that will click for someone, just not me. 

**19. Elemental Magic**

(4.5/5) *Kelcie Murphy and the Academy for the Unbreakable Arts* by Erika Lewis with Justis Bolding (narrator)

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes! \*Adults: If you like magic schools

*Orphaned girl discovers the world of fairies and magic and enters a school to train her magic skills and figure out the mystery of her past.* (Yes, there were a lot of these types.)

I was a little unsure about how highly rated this ended up, but it is one of the few books that, when I finished, I actively tried to get my daughter to read. It also probably got a bump from a good narrator. (The only audiobook I did this year.) I appreciated the competent and involved adults. The friendships that develop feel authentic, including the first crush vibes. Props for including a character with a disability and handling that disability well throughout the book. The school name is really unwieldy, though.

**20. Myths and Retellings - Not Greek or Roman**

(4/5) *Frances and the Monster* by Refe Tuma

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes \*Adults: Yes, if you enjoy middle grade

*A steampunk retelling of Frankenstein, a girl accidentally resurrects a monster while her parents are out of town and has to deal with the consequences.*

As a retelling, this is a little loose, but it is a fun read. Frances is a good protagonist with a nice arc. The pacing feels good and while I saw one twist coming, it wasn’t too far ahead of where it actually showed up and the revelation was written well enough to be satisfying, not irritating. 

**21. Substitution - Nonbinary Character (2021)**

(3.5/5) *Alex Wise vs. the End of the World* by Terry J. Benton-Walker 

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes, although it might be too scary for some. \*Adults? Maybe?

*Boy has to save his sister from the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse with some questionable help.*

I admit to not loving apocalypse books and this one had a secret villain that I didn’t love the execution of, so it was a hard book to get through. But the character development was great, the story beats were unique and I liked the message. I think there are definitely those who would really enjoy it.  

**22. Coastal or Island Setting - Features Seafaring** 

(4.5/5) *Lalani of the Distant Sea* by Erin Entrada Kelly with Lian Cho (Illustrator) \[AR 4.4, 600L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes! \*Adults? Yes

*Girl tries to save her coastal village after she makes a wish that goes wrong.*

This was a lovely book. With multiple POVs and stories woven throughout and with beautiful illustrations, it really immerses you in the world. “Never trust someone who wields power through fear.” Finding strength in yourself is a message that kids need and it is lovingly told in this book. The nature of the illustrations means that this is better read physically if possible, as opposed to an ebook. 

**23. Druids - Not the Iron Druid Chronicles**

(3/5) *Ennara and the Fallen Druid* by Angela Shelley

\*Recommend to Kids? Eh \*Adults? No

*Magical girl goes on a journey to find a weapon to save her village from a curse.*

The book was ok, but the pacing felt rushed in several places and a little too heavy in the exposition. There was nothing that turned me off, which is why it didn't drift down to a 2, but it didn’t engage me heavily either. It might be a little dark for younger readers.

**24. Featuring Robots**

(4.5/5) *Cleo Porter and the Body Electric* by Jake Burt \[AR 5.2, 740L\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes \*Adults? Those who like reading MG

*Young surgeon-in-training struggles to deliver a misdirected medication in her sealed, robotic building.* 

I don’t know why this book called me so. The dynamic cover pose? The neon color scheme? The fact that “I Sing the Body Electric” would get stuck in my head every time I saw the title? Whatever it was, this jumped up my list fast and I was not disappointed. I loved Cleo. I loved her deep compassion. I loved her fierceness and vulnerability. As a medical student, her view of the world through the lens of anatomy was a wonderful device. And the fact that Burt started writing this book before the pandemic hit and it was published during the worst of the shutdowns made it particularly poignant.

**25. Sequel**

(4/5) *Charlie Bone and the Time Twister* by Jenny Nimmo \[AR 4.7, 650\]

\*Recommend to Kids? Yes \*Adults? Eh

*Book 2: Charlie tries to return time-traveling relative to his own time while avoiding his scheming relatives.*

I hadn’t read this series at all, so I read the first two books to get to one I could use here. And I wasn’t mad at that. These are fun. There is a definite British flavor to the writing. I liked that the school was just an arts school with a few magical kids. I appreciated that the adults were complex. The mystery of Charlie’s dad I thought had an obvious answer in the first book and by the end of book 2 it still hadn’t been “solved” so that was a little annoying but it is still fun to read.

Me and my partner want to try to find a fantasy book to read together, however we have different things we enjoy in the world of fantasy writings. For example, she's much more into romantasy and is currently reading Sarah J Maas' A Court of Thorns and Roses. As for myself I enjoy longer epics and I've been working through Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan and reading Lord of the Rings finally since I finished The Silmarillion. I would say The Silmarillion is also my favorite book. I will say I've also read Elantris and Mistborn book 1. If there is some middle ground between the style or romantasy or that writing style and the writing style of the more epic series that would be best. 

Thank you all for your time!

TLDR: Partner likes romantasy and less of the world building, I like long worldbuilding and lore. What's a middle ground book or series between the two fields?",Fantasy

[https://beforewegoblog.com/review-the-gernsback-continuum-by-william-gibson/](https://beforewegoblog.com/review-the-gernsback-continuum-by-william-gibson/)

""The Gernsback Continuum"" is William Gibson of 1981, looking back forty years to the the Golden Age of Science Fiction from the 1920s to the 1930s. While not quite as long from the Nineteen Eighties to the Twenty-Twenties, it's pretty close and interesting to note that the same wistful nostalgia filter we have regarding cyberpunk as envisioned by Gibson and his contemporaries is the same that he was undoubtedly feeling when he wrote this story.

The premise is pretty simple, a photographer is sent to take photos of art deco architecture of a futuristic kind. Said photographer starts hallucinating an alternate 1980s with flying cars, massive highways, and people dressed like they're from the planet Krypton. Anyone who has played Fallout has an idea of what this looks like as there's the Red Rocket stations and Robbie the Robot-esque machines. His agent is surprisingly sympathetic to his losing his mind and says to basically ""cool down"" by watching a lot of porn and bad TV to shock his system back to normal.

The actual meaning of the story is debatable and has, indeed, been debated for decades. For most people, it's a straight up ode to the classic science fiction world as envisioned by the early Pulp writers that never came to exist. There's no Jetsons, Flash Gordon, or Buck Rogers-esque future. Life became far more mundane and there's a wistful nostalgia for a world where UFOs and crystal spires might have replaced skyscrapers or planes.

I maintain that Gibson was far more critical in his short story of the world as it might have been and recognized the darker undercurrent that was lurking beneath the mind of many Pulp writers. People who were as often as not reactionary as progressive. For modern day fans, we can look back to Deep Space Nine's ""Far Beyond the Stars"" to see how Pulp writers of the time period were really with all of the racism and sexism (arguably pretty toned down). Every HP Lovecraft fan certainly has to deal with the fact their author probably would have found some reason to hate them.

The Gernsback Continuum has a particularly haunting scene where the protagonist comes across a couple of Aryan superman looking folk staring at one of their cities. White, CIS, het, and vaguely fascist in a way the Pulps envisioned because they didn't see anyone outside of those norms having a place in the future. It becomes interesting to contrast cyberpunk, so-called dystopian fiction, as very much having a place for queer or people of color among it. William Gibson's writing alone for example.

Indeed, ""The Gernsback Continuum"" is a story that unwittingly sets itself up as the perfect metaphor for the current ongoing culture war between the Golden Age of Science Fiction and cyberpunk that it is a gateway story. The internet is absolutely filled with so-called speculative fiction fans that are furious at the inclusion of ""woke"" elements that represent the kind of reactionary future that cyberpunk challenged the assumptions of. To believe in a utopia in the 1930s was far easier for people who saw it as an extension of imperialist dreams and the status quo versus a dystopia that, ironically, promised an overthrow of the present order in the 1980s.

I've unironically had conversations with people who state that dystopian and post-apocalypse fiction was anti-progressive. The Disney movie Tomorrowland is based around the idea that refusing to believe things are getting better was somehow antithetical to it happening. That always brings me back to this short story and what I think the real message of cyberpunk is: recognizing the systemic flaws so that they can be corrected. 

Writing my own cyberpunk, I think of it as a wistful nostalgia-filled dream of motorcycles, cybernetics, and katana. It is stuff from my childhood when I watched Ghost in the Shell, Akira, and Bubblegum Crisis. Sadly, the modern day is a place where we've got micro-computers, the internet, megacorps, computer criminals, and the massive wealth disparity but very few of the people rising up to cast down the man. I wonder what the next age looking back on us will be.",Fantasy

1711838561.0,Hard Mode Bingo Wrap Up + Reviews,"I just completed bingo in time and had so much fun! I really tried to have a card that had: queer authors and stories and global ethnic majority authors and stories primarily. Plus, I did hard mode, and I feel like I ended up not doing too badly and finishing just about in time.

Here's a rundown of what I read & whether I read it for bingo:

 **Title with a Title (HM: Not a title of royalty):** **Paladin's Grace -  T Kingfisher**

* Was on my TBR anyway
* I enjoyed this. They are well written with realistic characters. I think this leaned more heavily on romance than fantasy in general despite the magical / mystery element of the plot. This was my first ever T Kingfisher and after reading more of her over the year I've found that they are all about 4\*'s for me, but aren't quite enough to make me love them.

 **Superheroes (HM: Not related to DC or Marvel)**:  **Blood Scion - Deborah Falaye**

* Was on by TBR anyway
* I want to read the rest of the series and I thought the world building was fantastic. The plot was unexpected and the brutality of the world was well explained in the narrative.

 **Bottom of the TBR (no HM)**:  **Moon Over Soho - Ben Aaronavich**

* I ended up not enjoying this as much as I enjoyed the first two of this series. I am probably not going to read the rest of it, and if I do it will be only by audiobook as the narration was amazing.

**Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy (HM: Book other than the 30 listed)**:  **He Who Drowned The World - Shelley Parker Chan**

* Was on my TBR anyway - I got this as an ARC
* I was so excited for this to come out and it did not disappoint. Fantastic end to the duology. Very dark themes and plot, much more so than she who became the sun but it was all carried through beautifully.

 **Young Adult (HM: Published in the last 5 years)**: **PET - Akaweke Emezi**

* Was on my TBR anyway
* I loved this so much, and need to read more of Emezi's work. This is a YA novel that deals with complex topics so so well, and in a way that's appropriate for the pitched age but genuinely a great read no matter when you approach it. The imagery was really strong throughout and I can picture multiple scenes from here, as well as the emotional moments. Really well crafted.

 **Mundane Jobs (HM: Does not take place on Earth)**:  **That Time I Got Drunk and Saved a Deamon - Kimberley Lemming**

* Was on my TBR anyway
* I felt really bad for not liking this book but it wasn't for me. Much too romance than fantasy, so I needed more cohesive worldbuilding to enjoy it.

 **Published in the 00s (HM: Not in top 30 of list)**:  **Rosemary and Rue - Senan McGuire**

* This was a read a discord group was doing and I joined as a result of bingo
* This was not bad, by any means but it also didn't really grip me. There was nothing wrong with it per se, except the MC seems to be running around getting injured a lot and making minimal progress which as a bit annoying. I don't read many books with the Fae in it, and that lore and I wasn't the biggest fan.

 **Angels and Demons (HM: Protag is angel or demon)**:  **Daughter of Smoke and Bone - Laini Taylor**

* This was a bookclub pick
* I ended up enjoying the second half of this book way more than the first, and liking it much much more after I put it down. The second half of the book adds a whole new dimension to everything that happened and is happening and the ability of Taylor to build those mysteries up and also completely surprise you as a reader was fantastic. That said I'm not racing to a sequel but I'd read it.

 **Five SFF Short Stories (HM: entire anthology or collection)**:   **Eyes Guts Throat Bones - Moira Fowley-Doyle**

* Was on my TBR anyway but it moved up due to this prompt!
* ... and I'm so grateful. I bloody loved this collection. This was the perfect mix of creepy and sexy and queer and was an absolute delight to read. I had so much fun with this book. I also didn't think I liked ""horror"" but this has maybe changed my mind.

**Horror (HM: Not King or Lovecraft):** **Vampires of El Norte - Isobel Canas**

* This was a bookclub pick
* The language in this was beautiful and it took the concept of vampires in a totally different direction, with some truly creepy moments. I also think the juxtaposition of the vampires with the US army was fantastic.

**Self-published/Indie Publisher (HM: Less than 100 goodreads rating or done AMA): Ice & Ivy - JD Evans**

* Was on my TBR anyway - I got this as an ARC
* I wish I enjoyed this one more. The FMC was a bit too sickly sweet and the book started proper at around 70%. I wouldn't have missed it because I truly love this series but I hope the next books have an FMC who isn't aggressively lovely. (This is now at 300 but it wasn't when I read it or for a while after!)

**Middle Eastern SFF (HM: Author is Middle Eastern):** **The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree - Shokoofeh Azar**

* I picked this up for the prompt, found in the thread of what to read
* I loved this. It made my cry at least twice. It was beautifully written and imaginative, and heartbreaking. I remember I was reading a romance at the time and marvelling how it was both more spicy than that, and also utterly moving. Really grateful bingo helped me find this.

**Published in 2023 (HM: Debut novel):** **Chain-Gang All-Stars - Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah**

* Was on my TBR anyway but prioritised due to prompt!
* I was truly scared of reading this because I knew I'd love it with my whole heart and suspected it would break me and it did. Sitting in dark room after finishing, screaming into the void, broken. This captured so many feelings so well. I learned so much from the footnotes. I loved the use of language and how it changed between the characters. And ugh, the characters. Best read of bingo.

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities (HM: Characters are not transported by door)**: **If Found Return to Hell - Em X Liu**

* Was on my TBR anyway but prioritised for bingo.
* I enjoyed this. It's a novella so it could always be more full but I loved the descriptions and language used at the start, and really didn't know where the story was going. I would like to read some of Liu's full novels as a result of this.

**POC Author (HM: takes place in futuristic, sci-fi world)**: **Bang Bang Bodhisattva by Aubrey Wood**

* Was on my TBR anyway - I got this as an ARC
* I don't think I had any expectations going into this book and I ended up absolutely loving it. Probably my second fave of this challenge. It's set in this very fun to read cyber-hell future yet manages to be weird and poignant with such lovable characters. The ending could have been stronger but it was so much fun I literally didn't mind.

**Book Club or Readalong Book (HM: must participate in discussion)**: **Duckett & Dyer: Dicks for Hire by G M Nair**

* Read for bingo.
* I wasn't a fan of this. I think my sense of humour in books is less HAHA and more narratively funny? This made too many outright jokes for me and felt tone deaf and poorly constructed in many areas. I wish I liked it. But, alas.

**Novella (HM: Novella is not by Tordotcom): The Last White Man - Mohsin Hamid**

* A library book club read.
* I liked this glimpse of a world where every white person slowly changed to being dark skinned. This was really an exploration of grief and loss in a myriad of ways and what acceptance looks like. I did this on audiobook but apparently the reading experience would have been different due to the playing with form of grammar and sentences. 

**Mythical Beasts (HM: No dragons or dragon-like creatures)**: **Lesser Known Monsters - Rory Michaelson**

* Was on my TBR anyway - I got this as an audio ARC
* I enjoyed this and I would read the second one. I liked the story and the world created. I think maybe too much time was spent in interludes that weren't explained until the end and the pay off wasn't quite enough, but the main storyline I had a lot of fun with. I want to see where the series goes.

**Elemental Magic (HM: Not Shades of Magic or Codex Alera)**: **The Dao of Magic by Andries Louws**

* Was on my TBR anyway
* This was awful. I wish I had never read it.

**Myths and Retellings (HM: Not Greek or Roman Mythology)**: **Soul of the Deep - Natasha Bowen**

* Was on my TBR anyway
* I preferred the first book in the series to this one, so while I enjoyed the rich world building and story elements, I felt like it could have given me a little more. I do flag though that it's YA and I'm not the intended audience. While I think some YA as above can be super enjoyable, this one felt a bit lacking at times in the plot despite the great setting and generally enjoyable writing.

**Queernorm Setting (HM: Not a futuristic setting):** **Saint Death's Daughter -  C S E Cooney**

* Was on my TBR anyway - prioritised for this prompt
* I loved this. People say that it has really dense world building and it does and it was a delight. I loved the cultures built. The intense first person narrative was really skilfully dealt with to show perspectives of other characters, and across time and distance to create this story so fully. I could read another book that fills in all the time jumps in this one. I can't wait for the next one to see these characters again.

**Coastal or Island Setting (HM: Also features seafaring):** **Black Sun - Rebecca Roanhorse**

* Was on my TBR anyway - prioritised for this prompt
* This was on my TBR for years and I regret not reading it sooner, and I'm so glad a finally did. So much fun. Such well crafted moments and pictures. The split narratives and how they came together was expert. Very excited for Fevered Star.

**Druids (HM: Not Iron Druid Chronicles):** **This Poison Heart - Kaylynn Bayron**

* Was on my TBR anyway
* I really enjoyed this one with my YA hat on, and the way I always enjoy series beginnings. The magic in this world was very fun. I loved the family at the centre of this book and really enjoyed the settings.

**Features Robots (HM: Robot MC): All Systems Red - Martha Wells**

* Was on my TBR anyway - prioritised for this prompt
* I am so glad bingo made me read this. This sub always mentions this book and I wasn't sure if it would be my thing. Of course it's my thing. I love Murderbot. How could I not?

**Sequel (HM: Book 3 or more)**: **Symphony for a Deadly Throne - E J Mellow**

* Was on my TBR anyway
* I really enjoyed 1 and 2, but this was a disappointment. It was predictable. The conflict in the romance made no sense to me and as a result it felt like a bad choice on the MMC's part that negatively impacted the FMC but nobody said anything about it. All the world building in the earlier books kind of vanished to focus on this romance that I didn't even root for.

Overall I really loved bingo and will 100% do it again! I really benefitted from this as a guide to move things up on my TBR. Everything already on my TBR that I prioritised as a result of this challenge was a book I loved. It made my stop shying away from books that felt overwhelming and just read them and I had SUCH a good time when I did. 

Also, despite going for a queer and global ethnic majority selection of books, I still ended up with quite a few that don't fit into either category. Definitely going to put the same energy into next year to see if I can improve these stats.

1711812986.0,Writing like Tolkien,"Hello

I am very new to reading fantasy seriously. I started with LotR, and have branched out from there. I haven't been able to perfectly put words to it, but it seems like authors from Tolkien's time wrote with more... weight? elevation? grandeur? I don't know, but all the modern authors I've encountered write in very plain language. And I'm not complaining! Like Rowling or Sanderson, it's good and I enjoy their stories, but they don't have the weight of tolkien's writing.

Again... super new to fantasy. Would love some advice for other books that are written like Tolkien

1711826470.0,Mini-Reviews for my 2023 Bingo Cards,"This has been a strange Bingo year for me. The last few years I always did at least two cards, and that was my original plan for this year as well. After last year’s international card with authors from 25 different countries was probably my favorite bingo card ever, I wanted to repeat that and do an additional hard mode card. However, it proved really difficult to find international authors for some of the squares, so I decided to condense it to just one card. Then I went through a months long reading slump where I struggled to finish anything... 

And a couple of days ago, after finally filling out my hard mode card, I decided to go through everything else I’ve read over the past year, only to realize that I had accidentally completed a whole second card. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/pzNLrWY.jpeg) is my all hard mode card, as international as I could make it. No visual for the second card because lazy. And because I checked hero mode on the turn-in, I guess I’m now morally obligated to write some reviews:

**Title with a Title**: 

* I got slightly lucky with this, because I had just started **Condomnauts** by Yoss when the bingo card dropped. Cuban science fiction about sexual diplomacy in the 24th century. Trippy, frequently gross, but also unique and entertaining. 

* For the second card I read **Soldier of the Mist** by Gene Wolfe. A mercenary loses his long term memory after a head injury and makes his way across a Greece populated by gods and mythical creatures to regain it. My first Wolfe, I have to read more by him because this was excellent.

**Superheroes**: 

* I'm not a huge fan of superheroes, so this could have been a tough square for me. Luckily I already had **The Meister of Decimen City** by Brenna Raney on my TBR and it turned out really enjoyable. A reluctant supervillain, family drama, genetically modified dinosaurs… 

* For my second card I read Stephen Mooney’s **The Rocketeer: The Great Race**, an hommage to golden age superheroes that left me mostly cold.

**Bottom of the TBR**: 

* I really dove deep for this one. Back in the late nineties as a kid I’d devour the mostly French/Belgian comics (Asterix, Tintin,...) in the library. In the back of the comic books were usually ads for other series by the same publisher. One of them - which my library didn’t have - was **The Incal** by Alejandro Jodorowsky and Moebius. Perfect choice for this square, wildly inventive with stunning artwork, wish we’d got to see what Jodorowsky could have done with Dune. 

* Second card: Not quite as much time on my TBR, but **Bauchelain and Korbal Broach** by Steven Erikson had been sitting unread on my shelf for at least ten years, so I figure it counts. Three novellas featuring two side characters from the Malazan series, entertaining although the humor fell a bit flat for me.

**Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy**: 

* Very much up my alley, I ended up with a bunch of options to choose from. **What You Are Looking for is in the Library** by Michiko Aoyama is a collection of linked short stories, all featuring people who are dissatisfied with their lives, visit their neighborhood library and almost magically get recommended the perfect book that helps them turn things around. Loved this, and not just because I’m a librarian. 

* In a similar vein, **The Miracles of the Namiya General Store** by Keigo Higashino is centered around a store whose owner used to answer anonymous requests for advice and somehow continues to do so after his death. Also fantastic, this was my favorite square of the card.

**Young Adult**: 

* One of the tougher squares, I don’t read a lot of YA, mostly because teenage protagonists often put me off. I ended up with **Tatami Time Machine Blues** by Tomihiko Morimi, the sequel to *Tatami Galaxy*. A sort of Comedy of Errors involving a broken remote control, an attempt at shooting a movie and time travel. 

* I also read **Wench** by Maxine Kaplan, which was fun but a bit too predictable for me.

**Mundane Jobs**: 

* **DallerGut Dream Department Store** by Lee Mi-ye was one of my favorite reads of last year. Set in the world of dreams it chronicles the adventures of a new employee at the biggest dream department store. Can’t wait for the sequel. 

* I also went with **City of Last Chances** by Adrian Tchaikovsky for the second card. More traditional fantasy about a revolution brewing in an occupied city, with a big ensemble cast including shopkeepers, students, priests…

**Published in the 00s**: 

* **The Scarlet Fig** by Avram Davidson is the final book in his Vergil Magus series. In the middle ages the Roman poet Vergil became associated with magic and alchemy, and Davidson decide to chronicle the adventures of this fictional version of Vergil as seen through the lens of a medieval version of the Roman empire. High concept, but very good and - because itÄs Avram Davidson - beautifully written. 

* The other book for this square is Martine McDonagh’s **I Have Waited, and You Have Come**, a short novel set in a post-apocalyptic Britain, with an unreliable narrator who is being stalked. Uncomfortable but fascinating.

**Angels and Demons**: 

* **King Bullet** is the final book of Richard Kadrey’s Sandman Slim series and delivers a grandiose conclusion to a series that has already killed most of Earth and shakens up the foundations of heaven and hell. To be honest, the last few books in the series felt like Kadrey was done with the character and going through the motions, so I’m glad it didn’t get dragged out further. 

* **Demon Daughter** by Lois McMaster Bujold is the final book I read for this year’s bingo and, like all the other Penric and Desdemona novellas, excellent.

**Five Short Stories**: 

* I had a couple of choices here, in the end I went with **The Book of Magic** edited by Gardner Dozois. The Scott Lynch story was the standout for me, but with one exception all other stories were good to great as well. 

* **Hit Parade of Tears** is the second collection of translated stories by Izumi Suzuki after *Terminal Boredom*. It was a decent read, but unfortunately it didn’t blow me away in the same way as the first volume did. It felt a bit like the most interesting stories had already been picked, so many of the stories here either fall flat because they don’t feel unique or drift too far into the surreal.

**Horror**: 

* I’m not a huge horror fan, so this was one of the trickier squares for me. I ended up reading **Wish You Weren’t Here** by Gabby Hutchinson Crouch, a horror/comedy/urban fantasy mash-up about a family of ghost hunters. Good, but not as good as her *Darkwood* trilogy which I absolutely loved. 

* I also started **The Silver Coin**, a comic anthology drawn by Michael Walsh and written by a variety of authors, all about a cursed silver coin that causes bad things to happen to whoever finds it. Not terrible, but also not good enough to continue reading after the first volume.

**Self-Published/Indie Publisher**: 

* I love nothing more than a good heist story. Unfortunately, **The Blood of Crows** by Alex Pierce wasn’t it. I’m struggling to remember anything about it, except my memory of struggling to finish it. 

* On the other hand, **The Nameless Restaurant** by Tao Wong was a very pleasant surprise. A cozy novella set in a small restaurant in Toronto, frequented by both mundane and magical guests and with an owner who seems to be hiding a few secrets.

**Set in the Middle East**: 

* **Your Wish Is My Command** by Deena Mohamed (also published as *Shubeik Lubeik*) blew me away. A fantastic graphic novel set in a version of Cairo where wishes can be bought and sold. Three connected stories that weave together into a brilliant narrative. 

* My other choice for this square was **When Gravity Fails** by George Alec Effinger. Cyberpunk set in a 22nd century Middle East, starring a down on his luck private detective who gets drawn into chasing a serial killer. Dark but good.

**Published in 2023**: 

* I enjoy Alice Bell’s writing on video games on RPS, so I was looking forward to her debut novel **Grave Expectations** about a medium who gets roped into investigating a murder at a country house. This was fast-paced, funny, sad and really good. 

* For my non-HM card I went with **The Circumference of the World** by Lavie Tidhar. I’ve read a bunch of his books, and while I’ve liked them all to some degree, this is one of the ones where I enjoyed elements of it but am not quite sure if I completely understood it. It’s centered around the hunt for a mysterious scifi novel and shifts between timelines and realities to a degree that I lost track of what was actually happening.

**Multiverse**: 

* Hilary Leichter’s *Temporary* was one of my favorite books of 2020, so I was eagerly awaiting **Terrace Story**, her second novel. It starts with a couple discovering a secret terrace hidden in their closet and blooms into a mosaic novel reaching into the past, the future and different reality streams. I’m struggling to nail down what the book is about, but I loved it. 

* I stumbled across **Europe in Autumn** by Dave Hutchinson more or less randomly and picked it up because it sounded like an interesting spy thriller, not expecting it to be as good as it actually is. In a near future Europe, where a pandemic has decimated the population (this came out in 2014), countries are fracturing into micronations on a daily basis. In this chaos, the protagonist, a cook in a Polish restaurant, gets recruited by secretive organisation. He quickly rises through the ranks, and through a series of increasingly dangerous missions gets drawn deeper and deeper into a web of conspiracies, double crosses, false identities until towards the end of the first book in the series he stumbles across the reason why this book qualifies for this square.

**POC Author**: 

* **Counterweight** by Djuna is a fast-paced cyberpunk thriller, in which a host of different factions try to get their hands on a secret hidden at the top of a space elevator. Quick and entertaining. 

* Tobias S. Buckell’s **A Stranger in the Citadel** didn’t work so well for me, but that might be due to my dislike of post-apocalyptic-disguised-as-fantasy settings.

**Book Club/Readalong**: 

* Unfortunately, my reaction to Shannon Chakraborty’s **The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi** was similar to that to her *City of Brass*: I like the setting, I like the ideas, but something about the execution leaves me completely cold. It’s as if, whenever there’s a choice, the story manages to take the less interesting route. 

* I also used my reread for this square, unsurprisingly I enjoyed **The Colour of Magic** by Terry Pratchett as much as I always have. Maybe I’ll finally make some headway on the full Discworld reread that I’ve been planning for years but keep pushing back in favor of new books.

**Novella**: 

* I like short books and I cannot lie. Lots of choices for this square (and I’m probably at the limit for novellas on my cards…), I ended up picking **The Labyrinth’s Archivist** by Day Al-Mohamed, an excellent novella set at a nexus connecting countless worlds where the Archivists collect every scrap of information about them they can find. The protagonist is the blind daughter of the Head Archivist who, after a suspicious death, starts uncovering a big conspiracy. Really good, would love to read stories set in this world. 

* My other pick was **Amphibian** by Christina Neuwirth, in which a company decides the best way to motivate their employees to perform better is to slowly fill the office with water. Surreal, funny, biting satire.

**Mythical Beasts**: 

* I expect **Untethered Sky** by Fonda Lee to show up on a lot of cards this year. I love the setting, where rocs and their human partners are tasked with protecting people from manticores. This novella is beautiful, it’s sad and Fonda Lee is an exceptional writer. 

* As you can probably guess, **The Dragon Machine** by Ben S. Dobson doesn’t qualify for hard mode. Still, the third book in the Magebreakers series is a fun read, featuring a duo of magical investigators in a (mostly) traditional fantasy setting. Perfect when I’m looking for something quick, entertaining if not terribly deep.

**Elemental Magic**: 

* Tough square for me, turns out elemental magic doesn’t feature that much in books that grab my attention. If I had a nickel for every disappointing urban fantasy book with a main character called Gin I read last November I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice. Jennifer Estep’s **Spider’s Bite** was the worse one, but at least I got to use it for bingo. Shoddy worldbuilding, painfully repetitive and the world’s most obvious twist at the end. This read like a first draft in need of a lot of polishing. 

* **The Long Chain** is book three of Dan Willis’ *Arcane Casebook* series, set in 1930s New York and featuring a detective who uses magical runes for his work. It falls in the same category as the Magebreakers (see square above) - not great literature, but always a decent choice when I need something quick and entertaining.

**Myths and Retellings**: 

* **Spear** by Nicola Griffith is an Arthurian novella, specifically a queer/genderbent retelling of Percival and the Grail which I liked a lot.

* **You Dreamed of Empires** by Álvaro Enrique is a reimagining of Hernán Cortés’ arrival at Tenochtitlan, which eventually led to the downfall of the Aztec empire. Here however, the meeting between Moctezuma and Cortés turns out differently… A fantastic novel, wildly original and trippy, not just because of the copious amounts of psychedelics involved.

**Queernorm Setting**: 

* I liked Alexandra Rowland’s *A Conspiracy of Truths* a lot, but it took me four years and several attempts to finish the sequel **A Choir of Lies**. Maybe it’s the different main character or the footnotes that put me off, but I just never got fully drawn into this story about the power of stories.

* During my long reading slump last year, I came across a list of 100 Great Short Books and decided to just pick one at random and power through, just to finally finish something. This worked great and so far I’ve finished ~25 of the books and I even got to use a few for bingo. One of them: **On a Red Station, Drifting** by Aliette de Bodard. I’ve read a few of her other books, but so far nothing else from the Xuya Universe. Far future sci-fi, where humanity has spread throughout the galaxy, with strong Vietnamese/Chinese influences. The artificial intelligence running the eponymous space station is failing, which in combination with the arrival of a disgraced former government official throws the complex web of relationships between the characters out of balance.

**Coastal/Island Setting**:

* In **The Mermaid of Black Conch** by Monique Roffey, a fisherman on a small Caribbean island discovers a mermaid, who is soon captured by wealthy tourists. He decides to save her and hides her in his house. As various people try to track her down, he spends time with her, learns her story and a romance begins to blossom. I went into it with somewhat low expectations, expecting it to be more of a romance novel, but ended up enjoying it a lot.

* A.Y. Chao's **Shanghai Immortal** features a half vampire, half fox-spirit main character who, despite ostensibly being a century old, comes across as the most annoying young adult to ever young adult. The setting was interesting, but the insufferable protagonist absolutely killed this book for me.

**Druids**: 

* The square that made me abandon my international card, because I couldn’t find anything druid-related from non-anglosphere authors except for Asterix. Of course, shortly after that someone reviewed **The Moonday Letters** by Emmi Itäranta and made it sound great, so I ended up with an international author anyways. An epistolary sci-fi novel following a sufficiently druid-like healer through the solar system, as she tries to track down her vanished spouse. I really enjoyed it, thanks to whoever recommended it on here!

* John Myers Myers’ **The Harp and the Blade** follows an Irish musician as he travels through the Loire valley and meets the locals. Set in post-Charlemagne France, where warlords, vikings and others are trying to fill the power vacuum, Finnian the Bard disturbs a druidic ritual on his flight from one of the aforementioned warlords and ends up cursed to help everyone he meets. This involves a lot of fighting, intrigue and of course poetry. I read Myers’ *Silverlock* some years back, this was a lot more straightforward and accessible.

**Features Robots**: 

* **The Alchemy of Stone** by Ekaterina Sedia stars Mattie, an automaton who lives in a steampunk-ish city where two factions (the Alchemists and the Mechanics) vie for power. As the conflict turns violent, she's struggling to find her place and gain independence of the chaos. Sad, but good.

* **Your Utopia** is the second collection of Bora Chung's stories to be translated. Not quite as good as *Cursed Bunny*, but it has a few standout pieces, among them the title story about autonomous machines trying to survive in a postapocalyptic, posthuman world.

**Sequel**: 

* For the HM card I read **Love Will Tear Us Apart** by C.K. McDonnell, the third book in the Stranger Times series about the staff of Manchester’s premier supernatural newspaper. A creepy wellness cult, ghosts, conspiracies and the usual great characters. Currently one of my favorite series, I have the fourth one queued up for the new bingo card. 

* The other book, Joel Rosenberg’s **Hour of the Octopus**, was fairly disappointing. I liked *D’Shai* when I read it last year, but the sequel didn’t work for me at all.

All in all, another 50 books read and reviewed(ish) for bingo. Many of them excellent, some absolute slogs and a bunch that sit somewhere in between. That makes it a total 450 books, spread out over 18 filled cards, read over the last 9 years, all in the name of bingo. Thanks to everyone involved in organizing it every year, I’m looking forward to the tenth card coming out!",Fantasy
1711822836.0,One Thing That Bugged Me About Sanderson's Writing in Mistborn,"I just finished the Mistborn trilogy and have mixed feelings about it. One thing that I noticed that really started to bother me near the end is how modern the characters acted. They don't feel like they exist in a fantasy world with ancient customs, they felt like they acted like people living in the 2000's. I guess this mostly came from they way characters spoke and the language they used. Elend didn't feel like an aristocrat living in a dark gothic setting he felt like a rich boy living in modern day, Vin didn't feel like a street urchin living under an oppresive regime. She felt like a poor youth growing up in a bad neighbourhood.   


Did anyone else feel this or am I crazy? I feel like other authors I've read in the past like George Martin, Robert Jordan and Joe Abercrombie have done a better job at making their characters feel like a product of their worlds. Do you think Sanderson gets better at this in the Stormlight Archive or is it about the same? ",Fantasy
1711821907.0,Realised my perception is very biased!,"I’ve just now realised that the idea in my head of what fantasy is, is very biased. I’ve only really read low fantasy, so can’t speak for high fantasy. Though the “image” in my head is very western centric. Specifically British/Irish/Nordic. I live in Ireland, and love stories including Irish paganism and myth and fantasy. Though I’ve never read much outside of this


So, the point of this post- Please give me suggestions on what to read/watch. I’d love to explore other areas. Preferably historical fantasy, but open to non. I honestly can’t even think where to start besides Greek mythology vibes?!?! Thanks in advance 🫶🏻 ",Fantasy
1711820223.0,How do you approach female depiction in fantasy? ,"This was a little too much to squeeze into the title properly, but for (probably especially) female fans of fantasy who struggle with misogyny or female representation/depictions within the genre, how long do you give a book before you make a decision on whether you want to keep reading or not? 

Do you decide one way or another on it based on the first chapter? The first five chapters? Do you read reviews to see how this is handled before you even pick up the book? 
Or maybe it's immeasurable, that you can't easily put your finger on. Maybe instead, you just read and then if something really turns you off to it, you just stop? 

Genuinely interested in hearing different opinions on how different readers approach this while reading fantasy. ",Fantasy

1711813387.0,Lightbringer (Brent Weeks) - DNF book 3,"Hello!

Picked up the book on a whim, then 2nd and half way through 3rd I stopped because...I did not really care about any of the characters?

1711812133.0,The Curious Case of *The Witness for the Dead*,"Spoilers ahead, I will censor anything major.

Years ago I read Katherine Addison's *The Goblin Emperor* and was charmed by its odd steampunk-adjacent world, its complicated naming conventions, and the way it focused on the main character coming in to themselves rather than some world-ending plot. The stakes weren't *low*, they were *personal*. A while back I became aware there were two more books set in the same world, the first follow-up being *The Witness for the Dead*. 

I wanted to discuss it with other people who have read the book because it seems really... odd? It's a good, well-written book, don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the experience of reading it. 

The book seems to signal that it's a murder mystery. Othala Celehar, the eponymous Witness for the Dead, is a cleric who can see the last moments of a dead person's life, so long as the corpse is relatively fresh. When a woman turns up murdered in a canal, he must find her killer.

Despite all the trappings of the mystery genre, >!this is not a mystery book. There is no way for the audience to guess who the perpetrator is, even if you use the meta of genre conventions to try to figure it out rather than clues in the book. There are very few clues to pick up on. Celehar only puts it together by happenstance, since he is legally required to be at the reading of a will that names the killer as an inheritor.!<

Otherwise, the book meanders through subplots that seem like they might have been intended to distract from the mystery, which would be fine if the reader needed the distraction to be prevented from figuring it all out too quickly, but I don't think that's the case.

Did I somehow misunderstand this book? I liked it and I like the world, but it seemed half-baked. It feels like it's really signalling that it's a mystery story, but doesn't deliver on the promise. Am I just not getting it?",Fantasy
1711811121.0,CJBlandford's 2023 Bingo Mini-Reviews,"I finished my 2023 Bingo card a couple of days ago and wanted to share my thoughts about the books I read. This was my second year participating and I'm a sucker for lists. I also have a huge amount of books that I've picked up over the years that I like to try to work into the bingo cards. So here are my reviews:

1. **Title with a Title** – *The Last Astronaut* by David Wellington. A good mix of science fiction and cosmic horror. Very cinematic writing that convincingly conveyed the immensity of outer space, and how tiny humans are in comparison. 4 stars, could have been 5 if the characters had more depth beyond 1 or 2 traits. 

2. **Superheroes** – *Hench* by Natalie Zina Walschots. A smart and compelling take on superheroes and their collateral damage. The lead is very sympathetic which made her story and growth believable and enjoyable. Unexpected body horror was quite disturbing. 5 stars.

3. **Bottom of the TBR** – *The Telling* by Ursula K. Le Guin. If you have read any of the Hainish cycle, you know what to expect. I originally bought this from a discount sale at a bookstore and when I started it I had no idea what was going on. Then I learned it was part of the Hainish Cycle, which had been going since the 1960s, and that maybe if I read the books before it, I would have a better idea of what was going on. I haven’t read all of the Hainish Cycle, but the first 5 sufficed to give me a clue as to what was going on here. It was good, formulaic, but with different circumstances to make it interesting. Le Guin was a master at portraying accurate anthropological ramifications of different types of societies. Good stuff. 3.5 stars

4. **Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy** – *The People in the Trees* by Hanya Yanagihara. Difficult, disturbing read. Technically, it was well composed and crafted. Extremely impressive structure for a debut novel. The content however is incredibly disturbing. I interpreted this as being about rape in two forms. The rape of a civilization and culture, and also the literal rape of children by a scientist who discovers a group of people who have figured out immortality. Very bleak book, still not quite sure how I made it through. No rating because while it was technically a marvel, the content was heartbreaking.

5. **Young Adult** – *Peeps* by Scott Westerfeld. This had such potential but ended up being less scary than I had hoped. The worldbuilding was cool, but the story didn’t go anywhere. 2 stars

6. **Mundane Jobs** – *A Shadow in Summer* by Daniel Abraham. I really enjoyed this one. There was not one character whose point of view I didn’t enjoy. Beautiful prose coupled with a believable and interesting world made this a fast read for me, even though looking back, not a lot happened. But even the small events felt momentous due to the author’s talents. 4 stars

7. **Published in the 2000s** – *Fallen Dragon* by Peter F. Hamilton. I did not relate to the main character at all. The story was structured weirdly with about 80% of the novel spent on a conflict between a pirate corporation and a revolutionary group and the last 20% reveals what is truly at stake and the tone changes completely. Worth reading once, but I would not re-read. 3 stars

8. **Angels and Demons** – *The Dirty Streets of Heaven* by Tad Williams.  Not my favorite Tad Williams novel, although I was interested enough in the story that I will likely read the rest of it. Our MC, Bobby Dollar, whose name gives him little choice to be anything other than a noir gumshoe, is a low-level angel who has to argue for souls to go to Heaven when their mortal bodies expire. He isn’t the most compelling character but I was intrigued enough by the story to stay interested. If the protagonist was more interesting and if the twist at the end wasn’t so obvious, this would have been better. 3 stars

9. **Five Short Stories** – *A Thousand Beginnings and Endings* – compiled by Ellen Oh and Elsie Chapman. As with most YA anthologies, some stories were better than others, but I just enjoyed seeing portrayals of different mythologies from around the world. My favorite story was The Land of Morning Calm by E.C. Myers, but I’m biased. I’ve read many of his books and they’re all great. Overall 3.5 stars

10. **Horror** – *The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires* by Grady Hendrix. I really liked this even though it was different from what I expected. I mean, the title evokes certain images and expectations because it is so perfect. But just because it was different from what I expected doesn’t mean it was bad. In fact, it was really moving. Ultimately an exploration of gaslighting, both from an individual perspective, but also on a communal level. The only downgrade I have for it was the weird pacing. After the first major climax it lost steam by having a huge time jump that slowed the momentum down. 4 stars

11. **Self-published OR Indie Publisher** – *Child of the Daystar* by Bryce O’Connor. This one lacked a hook. Despite it being only 260ish pages, it should have been a quick read, but I struggled to get through it. The introduction of the main character Raz was interesting. It did a good job to establish his outsider status in this world, but the story mainly just follows him around and stuff happens and he reacts to it. I need more of a plot hook to keep me interested, so that’s why this one wasn’t for me. 2 stars

12. **Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF** – *A Master of Djinn* by P. Djeli Clark. Loved the setting, loved the premise, loved the story. An alternate history Cairo where magic has been reintroduced to the world and people have to learn to navigate this new territory? Sign me up. 5 stars

13. **Published in 2023** – *Witch King* by Martha Wells. This one was kind of a tough read. I mostly liked it, but it was hard to tell what exactly was at stake because of the style of storytelling and lack of explanation from the narrators. The world is interesting, and the magic systems are interesting, but it took me awhile to figure out the different systems. There wasn’t a proper hook for me, and despite this being action-packed, without establishing importance for what is at stake, some of the action fell flat. 3 stars. 

14. **Multiverse or Alternate Realities** – *The Master of Revels* by Nicole Galland. I liked it but didn’t love it. Most of the main characters from book 1 are absent or done dirty. Kinda felt like the author just really wanted to show off her Shakespeare knowledge. The big world-altering setup from the first book was reduced to what felt like a much smaller story, with smaller stakes. Still good, and I will still continue the series if more of it is published. 3 stars

15. **POC Author** – *House of Gold* by C.T. Rwizi. I enjoyed this and it was a fairly snappy read. I wanted more worldbuilding though. I liked the concept and the environment but a lot of time was spent on the characters relationship and not on the world as much as I would have liked.

16. **Book Club or Readalong Book** – *The Final Strife* by Saara El-Arifi. I wanted to read something outside of my normal wheelhouse and chose a book from the Fantasy Romance book club here, but apparently I chose the wrong month because the romance was more in the background, with the darker story taking the main stage. As a romance, I felt like the foundation for a relationship was a bit shaky, since the romance starts after the main character breaks into a young woman’s home, gets mistaken for an assassin, gets captured, goes through a forced withdrawal from a drug addiction while in captivity and enters into an agreement with her captor to teach her combat and other necessary skills in order to survive an upcoming ordeal to determine new leaders in this land. I mean, who hasn’t started a relationship under these circumstances, amirite? But still a good book, 4 stars

17. **Novella** – *Elevation* by Stephen King. Lacking the usual Stephen King gruesomeness and conflict and instead focuses on the characters personal growth. In fact, it was kind of nice, despite what is happening to the main character. It was a fast read and felt almost like an exercise in writing a bare bones story with all extraneous information edited out. Still glad I didn’t pay full price for it though. 3 stars

18. **Mythical Beasts** – *Devolution* by Max Brooks. Less epic in scope than World War Z, but that means Brooks could write a tighter, more focused story. Once the story finished the setup, it flies by. I had a lot of fun with this tale of a group of sasquatch attack an isolated, sustainability-obsessed group near Mt. Rainier after a volcanic eruption. 4 stars

19. **SUBSTITUTION: Climate Fiction from 2020’s card** – *Green Earth* by Kim Stanley Robinson. I love Kim Stanley Robinson’s writing. Even when its kind of all over the place, like this trilogy is, its still interesting and thoughtful. This book did make me sad though, because even though the book ended on a hopeful note about climate change in the US of the series, it felt like an alternate reality because that time has already passed us by, without anyone in our world taking bold risks to combat climate change. I look at this book as what could have been, instead of the sad reality of what is. 4 stars

20. **Myths and Retellings** – *The Kingmaking* by Helen Hollick. I mostly hated this? It might have had something to do with reading Bernard Cornwell’s King Arthur series before this, but in this Arthur retelling, Arthur is a major jerk and womanizer. He does grow over the course of this first book, but I did not care enough to continue the series, but I still did not think that Arthur was a worthy leader or even that skilled of a leader. 2 stars

21. **Queernorm Setting** – *An Absolutely Remarkable Thing* by Hank Green. Many good works of science fiction use the future to actually talk about the present. This book uses the present to talk about the present, and is a good reflection of the deeply weird times we live in and what being internet famous actually means and how the internet has changed society in good and bad ways. I enjoyed the way Hank writes, it was addictive, in much the same way as social media is addictive. I liked the story and the adventure and want to see where the story goes from here. 4 stars

22. **Coastal or Island Setting** – *The Great Shard War* by Andrea Stewart. A good conclusion to the trilogy. I enjoyed the characters’ growth throughout this book, even if their missions were a bit frustrating at times. I still wish a little more time was spent on the magic system because it was very fascinating, and I wanted to learn even more about it. 4 stars.

23. **Druids** – *The Winter King* by Bernard Cornwell. I liked this more realistic take on King Arthur. Here is not a king, but a Warlord trying to unite the various factions against the invading Saxons. It is dark, bloody, and very violent in combat and in daily life and features the OG Druid himself, Merlin. And in good wizard and druid tradition, Merlin is a complete jerk. He is a crazed, single-minded asshole who is trying to bring back the Old Gods. Overall, despite the plot being a little slow to start, I grew to really love this series. 3.5 stars for this first book.

24. **Featuring Robots** – *A Closed and Common Orbit* by Becky Chambers. I liked this one a bit more than The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet. It was a smaller, more focused story that switched between two timelines to tell the story. It is largely about the power of found family and ends on a hopeful note. Despite some pretty heavy content, it tends to not wallow in despair but instead focused on hope and love. 4 stars.

25. **Sequel** – Lasher by Anne Rice. What is wrong with me? Why did I come back for more of this questionable content? The ending of the first book left me with such a bad taste in my mouth that I wasn’t sure if I wanted to continue the series. Anne Rice had one really messed up imagination, but it is a rich, deep imagination that does keep your eyes glued to the page, even when there is so much weird incest and rape going on. To answer my question, I wanted to see if there was a reason why the characters behaved the way they do in this series, and yes, there is a reason everyone is so depraved and stuck in this incestuous family. I was much happier with the ending of this book but I am still only going to rate it 2 stars because of all the gross content to get through.

**Title with a Title (HM: No royalty)**

*Saint Death’s Daughter by C.S.E Cooney - 5.5/5*

* about: Lanie (her full name is Miscellaneous Immiscible Stones) comes from a family of Assassins, Necromancers and so on. Lance is a necromancer herself, she also has a literal allergy against violence. After the death of Lanie’s parents, she has to deal with her psychotic sister Nita, with debtors that want to take their ancestral estates, and some other problems.
* how I liked it: I loved this so much. As I read in a review, “every time you think you know what kind of story this is, the author chooses a different path” (or something like that). I loved Lanie and Mak, I loved parts of the society she lived in, I loved the footnotes and weird names and so on. The story is fairly dark at some points, but so very happy at others, and there is a consistent sweetness of it all. I really liked how Lanie got to change her opinions about some of the antagonists. The ending was unexpected, while it could stand on its own I’m very glad there will be some sequels. u/aristifer also did a lovely review of this book a while ago.
* recommendations: There’s a short story collection by Cooney (“Bone swans”) that also has her very recognisable style. Also very dark and full of beauty and death.

**Superheroes (HM: no Marvel or DC)**

*Dreadnought by April Daniels - 3.5/5*

* about: The protagonists is gifted the superhero powers of Dreadnought, which as a by-product change her body to the female version of it that she always wished for. Danielle tries to get used to being a super-hero, searches for the killer of the previous Dreadnought, and has troubles with her transphobic family among others.
* how I liked it: Sweet, I’m just not really into superhero books. The whole story was simpler than I expected, I was always waiting for twists and revelations that didn’t really come.

**Bottom of the TBR**

*The Kingdom of Back by Marie Lu - 3.5/5*

* about: This is the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s older sister, Nannerl. She is also a child prodigy but has to compose in secret because it is not suitable for women. Nannerl is trying to make her father proud while putting up with standing in her little brother’s shadow, when her most important wish is to be remembered by posterity. The fantasy part is the Kingdom of Back which Wolferl and Nannerl make up for their entertainment, but which then starts to intrude into their lives.
* how I liked it: I bounced of it once, then tried again after ""Little, Big"" and found myself much better able to appreciate this story’s beautiful language and imagery. I’m not sure how content I am with the end, though I guess there is only so much the author could do about it given that it’s about a historical personality.

**Magical Realism or Lit Fantasy**

*Little, Big by John Crowley - 5/5*

* about: Smoky Barnable travels to Edgewood to marry Daily Alice, and is thus caught up in the Story that has determined Alice’s family’s fate for some generations. There is a large wood, a weird house and a city. There might be fairies.
* how I liked it: I counted this one as “my favourite book read for Bingo”. In absolute terms I still loved “Saint Death’s Daughter” more, but this here is one book I definitively wouldn’t have read without bingo. I had so far only read magical realism by Gabriel Garcia Marquez (“One hundred years of solitude” and some short stories) and that just wasn’t for me. In contrast, I loved “Little, Big” so much that I read it in small portions like pralines until at some point the bingo deadline was somewhat too close for my comfort. It’s the language, the way that every sentence in a pretty long book seems full of meaning and beauty. Many things are somewhat obfuscated or seemingly senseless for a long while, but that was alright with me. The ending is a spiralling in of the Story, and left me tearing up.

**Young Adult (HM: Published in the last five years)**

*Terciel and Elinor by Garth Nix - 3/5*

* about: This is the story of Sabriel’s parents (protagonist from the Old Kingdom trilogy). It follows Terciel during his apprenticeship as a necromancer, and how he meets and gets to know his love Elinor.
* how I liked it: This story is nice but not very special. I liked reading it for the nostalgia of coming back to the world of the Old Kingdom.

**Mundane Jobs (HM: Does not take place on Earth)**

*Dreamstorm by M.C.A. Hogarth - 4.5/5*

* about: A pair of telepathic alien psychotherapists have a practice on a space station and think about their life choices.
* how I liked it: This is the fourth part of the Dreamhealer series (of which the 1st and 2nd part are really one book and should NOT be read separately). It’s very sweet, though there is some tragedy and its repercussions.
* recommendations: I would recommend this series to anyone who thinks that my 1-phrase review sounds interesting. The books in it are all of a similar quality in my opinion.

**Published in the 2000s (HM: Not on the Best of 2023 list)**

*The Curse of Chalion by Lois McMaster - 4.5/5*

* about: The former soldier Cazaril is named tutor of the spirited princess Iselle and tries to protect her in face of a curse on her family.
* how I liked it: I really loved this book, the 0.5 star minus is because of one relation with an absolutely unnecessary age gap. Otherwise it is great, classic fantasy with a very interesting take on gods and sainthood.

**Angels and Demons**

*The Angel of the Crows by Katherine Addison - 5/5*

* about: This is a Sherlock Holmes retelling with angels (among them Crow who is the Sherlock equivalent), plus Jack the Ripper.
* how I liked it: This is a comfort read of mine (though not particularly cozy). I love Katherine Eddison, and quite like detective fiction including. There is an overarching story arc here, but the form is more like a collection of short detective stories. If you have read or watched Sherlock you will recognise many parts, but the author changes them in many aspects. I really liked the result.

**Five Short Stories (HM: Short story collection)**

*Fragile Things by Neil Gaiman - 3.5/5*

* about: I’m not sure there is an about, an overarching theme. I didn’t really notice one.
* how I liked it: I love Good Omens and quite liked American Gods, but this collection didn’t really stay in my memory. Some of the stories where too much from the horror genre for my taste. I halfway remember that some stories were really good, delicate weirdness, so I intend to reread it at some point.

**Horror (HM: Not King or Lovecraft)**

*Trail of Lightning by Rebecca Roanhorse - 3/5*

* about: Maggie is a Dinétah monster hunter with a troubled past and the interest of several gods. With the help of an unconventional medicine man, she has to find out the truth behind recent killings.
* how I liked it: I’m really not into horror. I’m not totally sure this is horror, I read this book for a different category but finally put it here because I found it’s monsters really scary and disgusting. Maybe it’s the graphic descriptions of them feeding on a child at the beginning of the book. I quite liked the world and the indigenous culture and gods, and I guess the story is really good too, but I definitively won’t continue this series.

**Self published (HM: Less than 100 goodreads votes)**

*The Wandering Inn 8 by pirateaba - 4.5/5*

* about: The Innworld is a fantasy world with lots different of fantasy peoples, some of them classical and others original. People living there can level up in classes and gain skills, very like in a computer game. Most of the protagonists are people from Earth and were somehow transported into this world.
* how I liked it: I absolutely love the series, it has several of my all time favourite persons and the author manages to surprise me very regularly. This part of the series I liked very well. Erin’s part a bit less than the rest, but it was still great. If you read until the end of part 7, you should definitively continue.

**Set in the Middle East (HM: Author of Middle Eastern heritage)**

*The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by Shannon Chakraborty - 4/5*

* about: The retired pirate Amina al-Sirafi accepts one final adventure to protect her family. She now has to get her crew together, find the treasure, overcome the competitors and deal with an annoying demon she has a personal history with.
* how I liked it: Very well. I do not read about pirates enough, and a protagonist who is a mother, and religious. I wasn’t quite a fan of one of Amina’s relationships which plays a prominent role.

**Published in 2023**

*Mortal Follies by Alexis Hall - 4/5*

* about: At the time of the Napoleanic wars, a debutante is cursed and in the process of searching for a solution discovers her lesbianism by falling in love for the first time.
* how I liked it: I quite liked having a protagonist who didn’t really know what to do but went about it with courage and common sense. Plus she has a lovable best friend with somewhat less common sense. I also enjoyed the narration by Puck and the way Maelys realisations about love and desire are portrayed.

**Multiverses**

*The Traveler’s Gate by Will Wight - 4.5/5*

* about: Traveler’s can summon energy from certain other planes. Simon is caught up in the war between the ruthless Overlords and their enemies when his friend is revealed as a prophesied hero. To protect himself and his friends, Simon starts learning from the especially dangerous territory of Valinhall.
* how I liked it: This is quite an action-heavy story, the focus is on the magic and fantastical different worlds and the fighting. That fit my mood well at the time, and I had no real problems with the characterisation either. I read the trilogy in one go and don’t quite remember which parts of it belonged to the first book, but I really enjoyed all of it.

**POC Author (HM: futuristic, sci-fi world)**

*Binti trilogy by Nnedi Okorafor - 4.5/5*

* about: In the first novella of the trilogy, Binti is traveling to a university on a different planet when the ship is attacked by Meduse who kill all the other students. Now she is has to negotiate with them to prevent a catastrophe. In the later novellas Binti deals with the consequences and how the events have changed her.
* how I liked it: This is the first time I have read something by Nnedi Okorafor, but definitely not the last. Her world-building is lush and sits on lots of African culture and philosophy I had not heard of before, which is one of the very unique things here. Another is how the author deals with math: doing math in your head is portrayed like a kind of magic that can create electrical currents on your person, which are then used for communication, for the creation of technology and for other purposes. Large themes in this story are identity, belonging, change, mental problems and prejudices between groups. I think my heaviest complaint is that the plot was sometimes a little abrupt.

**Book Club or Readalong Book**

*A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin - 5/5*

* about: Ger learns magic and has to mature to deal with the consequences of his youthful arrogance.
* how I liked it: This had a fairy-tale feeling at times, or something like the Odyssey I guess. It did not feel like a children’s book to me, more something that is rather simple because it is pure and does not need more embellishment.

**Novella (HM: Not published by Tordotcom Publishing)**

*The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson - 3.5/5*

* about: A lawyer finds out what’s going on with his friend Dr. Jekyll and the strange and brutal Mr. Hyde.
* how I liked it: Surprisingly well (I do not often read that old fantasy/science fiction). It has the structure of a detective novel, only the conclusion (a soul separated into good and evil) belongs to the SFF genre.
* Originally I read “To be taught, if fortunate” for this square and loved it, I just couldn’t use it due to having “A Psalm for the Wild-Built” for the robot square.

**Mythical Beasts (HM: No Dragon-like creatures)**

*The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle - 5/5*

* about: The last unicorn is searching for her people. On the way she meets a magician, a rebel and some other folk.
* how I liked it: I found this story absolutely enchanting. Much to sad for a children’s tale, but not in the depressing way. Very beautiful language, I’m very glad I finally came around to reading it.

**Elemental Magic**

*The Return of Fitzroy Angursell by Victoria Goddard - 5/5*

* about: The poet and mage Fitzroy Angursell enjoys his newly found freedom, meets old friends and has some marvellous and serendipitous adventures.
* how I liked it: This was my second book by Victoria Goddard after “The Hands of the Emperor” (and you absolutely have to read that one first), and I cherish it very much. The beginning is so full of joy, later there is some well-deserved grief but also very good friends to share it with. “The redoubtable Pali Avramapul” which comes afterwards actually retreads one part of this story from her perspective before continuing, which I also found worthwhile.
* Warning: If you read the amazon reviews of this before starting with “The Hands of the Emperor”, you will likely have a different reading experience.

**Myth and Retellings (HM: No Roman or Greek mythology)**

*The Stars Undying by Emery Robin - 3.5/5*

* about: a sci-fi retelling of Caesar and Cleopatra
* how I liked it: This story is mostly focused on the relationship between Altagracia and Matheus, which I am not normally a fan of. Here it was alright, because Altagracia is such an interesting figure. Altagracia tells you at the beginning that she is a liar, and she is: to herself and others and the reader. That made for a rather fascinating journey.

**Queernorm Setting (HM: Not a futuristic setting)**

*The Drowned Woods by Emily Lloyd-Jones - 4/5*

* about: A water mage that deserted from serving their prince, who drafted them as a child, is asked by a spymaster to join a mission with the aim of destroy the prince’s power source.
* how I liked it: It was really nice, maybe not super special but a satisfying heist story. Convincing people, surprising twists and a nice though not that fascinating world around it.

**Coastal Setting (HM: features sea-faring)**

*The Monster Baru Cormorant by Seth Dickinson - 4/5*

* about: Baru has now come to some power in the Empire she hates, and wants to start a war with a neighbouring federation to destroy both. She also has mental problems coming from injury and trauma.
* how I liked it: I liked this significantly less than the first book. Partly because Baru has changed so much that I sometimes had difficulties rooting for her or understanding her reasons for certain decisions. I quite love Tau though, so I’m quite looking forward to seeing more of him and his culture in the third book.

**Druid (HM: Not the Iron Druid Chronicles)**

*Dreamer’s Pool by Juliet Marilier - 4.5/5*

* about: The embittered healer Blackthorn makes a deal to escape prison and death. Together with a former fellow inmate she travels to Dalriada, where she works as a healer. Eventually Blackthorn is asked to help the crown prince of Dalriada solve a mystery concerning his fiancée.
* how I liked it: This is another book with great characterisation and a compelling mystery to be solved. The descriptions of their surroundings are also quite soothing. Glad to have found this one.

**Features Robots**

*A Psalm for the Wild-Built & A Prayer for the Crown-Shy by Becky Chambers - 5/5 & 4/5*

* about: Sibling Dex decides to change their life and become a Tea Monk. Later they meet the robot Mosscap, who wants to answer the question of “What do people need?”
* how I liked it: I have loved everything I read by Becky Chambers so far, and this was no exception. Such a small book to have so much in it. Pangea is a very optimistic vision of a future where everybody basically has all they need, and the wilderness is also respected. The first book’s dedication is “For everybody who could use a break”, and I quite agree with that. The second book felt less large than the first one to me and more like some additional chapters, but it is still delightful.

**Sequel (HM: book 3 or later)**

*Making Money by Terry Pratchett - 4.5/5*

* about: Former con artist Moist von Lipwig gets a new job as Master of the Royal Mint of Ankh-Morpork, and makes some new enemies.
* how I liked it: Moist von Lipwig was one of my entry points into Discworld with “Going Postal”. This sequel is very nearly as good. If you want more Ankh-Morpork in your life, this is a very enjoyable read.

1711806781.0,Assassins Quest chapter 6,"Spoiler below, I’m unable to grey out the text using the app for some reason. 
I just finished Hobb’s Assassin’s Quest, and enjoyed it, but not nearly as much as the first 2. Something that bothers me that I was hoping a more careful reader might help me with is how in Chapter 6, Fitz meets up with 2 of the old blood, rejects them, and is even given this promise of future help: “If you are in need, cry out, as you do to Nighteyes…those who hear may come to help you.” Why is this chapter and obvious plot thread in this book at all if nothing ever comes of it?",Fantasy
1711806721.0,I've completed the Wheel of Time series!,"I just finished A Memory of Light, almost exactly four years since I started reading The Eye of the World on April 1st, 2020. It’s been four years of ups and downs: things like frustrating (wool-headed) characters, overly long and detailed descriptions and uneven pacing have battled with excitement over cool moments, character growth and amazing worldbuilding.

Was it a perfect ending? No, but I don’t think there is such a thing to a series of this length and scope. It comes close though, so my gut-reaction rating is 5/5 stars, but it might change when I’ve processed it more.

Aside from the “classic” epic moments like Rhuidean, Rand claiming *Callandor* at Tear, Dumai’s Wells, the cleansing of *saidin* and the Last Battle, one of my all-time favorites was Verin’s big moment – my jaw dropped when she casually revealed herself to Egwene. I knew she was up to something, but I hadn’t expected *that*.

Mat Cauthon’s name often comes up in threads over most popular/favorite fantasy characters. It took me a while to understand why that annoying guy had earned a place in people’s hearts, but I completely agree now. Aside from being a great “reluctant hero”, I love his fashion sense (the hat, the scarf, the lace-trimmed jackets) and that he always created elaborate backstories for his disguise characters (it’s good to be prepared!).

As you can see, Rand and his friends won me over, and it feels empty not having another book to start. Although, as I’ve read 14 times now, there are no ends and beginnings to the Wheel of Time…",Fantasy

1711801686.0,Age of madness trilogy by Joe Abercrombie was not as satisfying as the first law trilogy or the standalone trilogy,I am fan of Joe Abercrombie and consider the first law and the standalone trilogies as two of the best fantasy trilogies ever written. I heard that Age of madness is the epitome of his craft as a writer.. so I expected great things from the series.. unfortunately it did not work as well as the other first law stories for me. He has certainly improved as a writer but my issue is with the plot and some characters. Personally I am not a huge fan of Industrial Revolution plots so I didn’t care for any of that . Also Broad was a very bland character and we spent a lot of time with him. The other characters were done well but do not hold a candle to the legacy characters. The best part for me was the tease at the end. I don’t know when Joe will write a sequel series but I’m dying to see what happens next. Overall a strong trilogy that just failed to match or surpass the previous trilogies . I would give this 8/10 overall. ,Fantasy
1711801028.0,"Choose two characters from different franchises that you would love to see interact with each other, as well the place that they would meet","I would love to see an interaction between Prince Jalan Kendeth and Nicomo Cosca. They would either get along and entertain each other or hate each other's guts, with a high possibility of both of them getting drunk.I could definitely imagine them in some sort of rundown inn with a cup of cheap ale in hand. 

Snorri and Friendly would also be there, basically as bodyguards for the two of them. Snorri might try to strike a conversation but Friendly will just continue to roll his dice and barely talk to him.

Another interesting one would be Bedeckt from Manifest Delusions and most of the Named Northmen from The First Law. Especially Logen or Craw. Most of the Named Men are war veterans similar to Bedeckt, so they would probably have to share a lot of stories of war and slaughter with each other. I could also imagine them in an inn as well, although there is a lower chance of them causing trouble compared to Jalan and Cosca",Fantasy

1711799770.0,Play of Shadows by Sebastien De Castell,"I'm about a quarter of the way through the new greatcoats book and I'm really enjoying it.

The first series was exactly what I was looking for in a fantasy series when I discovered it fairly recently. The new book is something of a departure and I'm really liking the direction. It's reminding me of Lies of Locke Lamora in terms of the setting, the high society intrigue and conspiracy but within the realm of Tristia and the Greatcoats. 

Anyone else reading this? I'm curious to hear people's thoughts as they make their way through. I keep trying to see where the connection is between this and Crucible of Chaos but maybe it's a slower burn than that. 

I hope others are enjoying it too.",Fantasy

1711787478.0,Bingo Review (after finding out about bingo in February,"I found out about r/Fantasy 2023 Book Bingo mid February, where I did the mature thing and figured out how close I was instead of working on an assignment that was due the week after. I had gone into 2023 telling myself that I was going to try to expand my horizons and read some classics ( I finished my reread of the original Dune series in January 2023 and finished my plans for reading through Asomiv (with *The Gods Themselves*) in March 2024.

**Title with a Title**

*Firefly - Big Damn Hero* by James Lovegrove (HM)

My wife found a trove of Firefly tie-in books at the library so I have worked through what was there (in addition to making my teenage son watch through the series). It was fine, I rated the 4 that I read (all by Lovegrove - which means wolf den, little trivia fact for you) as 4s this year, I don't really remember any individually standing out.

**Superheroes**

*The Boys* by Garth Ennis (HM)

Again, I found these at the library and was interested because of the show. The first three omnibus volumes I rates 3/5, good enough to get the next volume, not enough to search very hard.

**Bottom of the TBR**

*The Handmaid's Tale* by Margaret Atwood (HM)

I only started keeping a list TBR in 2021 and I've done reasonably well with (aside from the Brian Herbert Dune books reread which I haven't been able to start). I had purchased the Handmaid's Tale in 2017 in an airport when the series started. It was fine, kind of an abrupt ending but interesting (and prescient) world building. 3 Stars.

**Magical Realism**

*Metamorphosis and Other Stories* by Franz Kafka

I had trouble with this square but I received this book as a birthday present in 2023 and have read it since. 4/5 stars.

**Young Adult**

*A Whole New World* by Liz Braswell - read after discovering Bingo

I started reading this after I found out about Bingo for the Middle East square but ultimately used a different book. For what it was, and considering that I loved Aladdin growing up, amazing! 4/5 stars.

**Mundane Jobs**

*Hyperion* by Dan Simmons  (HM)

A preacher, ~~soldier~~, poet, an academic (with an archeologist), a private detective, a ships captain, and a government official set out on a pilgrimage where, hopefully, >!only one of them won't die!<. It's a classic for a reason, 5/5 stars.

**Published in the 00s**

*The Final Empire* by Brandon Sanderson

I read through the trilogy this year. Loved the 1st, thought the 2nd was ok until the last 100 pages where I couldn't put it down, which continued into the 3rd one! 5 stars.

**Angels and Demons**

*This Present Darkness* by Frank Peretti  (HM)

I read this as a teenager and it had been on my TBR to see if I still felt about it like I did then. I actually read this after I found out about Bingo as it was a good excuse to actually read it. Characters felt 2 dimensional, everything (including addiction) is solved through prayer, but the ending is as fast paced as I remember. 2 stars.

**Five SFF Short Stories**

*Johnny Mnemonic* by William Gibson

*I have no Mouth and I Must Scream* by Ellison Harlan

*Compulsory* & *Home, Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory* by Martha Wells

*The 11th Metal* by Brandon Sanderson

I actually didn't read a collection of short stories this year, which is weird because I read *We Can Remember It for You Wholesale* by Philip K. Dick and *Father of Lies* by KJ Parker is on my TBR.

**Horror**

*Night of the Living Trekkies* by Kevin David Anderson  (HM)

My wife picked this up in a novelty shop. One of the best weird things she's ever picked up! Thoroughly enjoyed, 4/5 stars.

**Self-Published OR Indie Publisher**

*Dragonfired* by J. Zachary Pike

Found this series mid 2022 and the final book came out at the end of 2023. Great mix of finance, D&D, humour, and fantasy! 5 Stars.

**Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF**

*A Master of Djinn* by P. Djèlí Clark - read after discovering Bingo

I found this book in the library (as well as *Ringshout*) after finding out about Bingo. It was fine (4 stars) but I don't think I'm interested enough to read the prequel novellas.

**Published in 2023**

*System Collapse* by Martha Wells

I found the Murderbot series in a hard way in August 2023 and have currently read through them all (including the short stories above). Also made the entire family read these through. 5 stars.

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities**

*Piranesi* by Susanna Clarke  (HM) - read after discovering Bingo

I originally had *The Man Who Folded Himself* by David Gerrold (5 stars) until I realised that while there was meeting others from multiverses there was no ""travelling"" through multiverses so it might not count. I read a Bingo review saying that you should read *Piranesi* blind so I stopped reading the review then and read the book in 2 nights. Stop reading this review and go read the book blind! First half is ""wtf is going on"" second half is full of emotions. 5 stars.

**POC Author**

*Na Viro* by Gina Cole  (HM) - read after discovering Bingo (but it was on the list)

Enjoyable first novel by a Kiwi (of Fijian, Scottish and Welsh descent). I read this after finding out about Bingo but it was on my TBR. First half felt like I should be reading it for the seafaring square and the second half isn't for physicists as the spaceships act more like canoes than rocket ships but an enjoyable story. 5 stars.

**Book Club OR Readalong Book**

*Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley

Another book I got for my birthday (because I asked for it directly). Another classic for a reason. 5 stars.

**Novella**

*The Time Machine* by H. G. Wells (HM)

3rd book received because I asked for it. It probably wasn't considered a novella when it was first published but at 144 pages I'm sure it counts. Enjoyable, but it's been remade or referenced so much it's hard to be as enthused for it as it probably deserves. 4 stars.

**Mythical Beasts**

*Beowulf* by Unknown, Translated by JRR Tolkien, Edited by Christopher Tolkien

I found this in the bookstore and bought it immediately. I think there's a reason that JRR didn't publish it in his time, I might see if I can find a Heaney translation, however the Salic Spell portion was very interesting. 4 stars.

**Elemental Magic**

*The Sword of Kaigen* by M. L. Wang   (HM) - read after discovering Bingo (but it was on the list)

Amazing self published book which, as a father and a husband, I'm very happy I read. I read it specifically for this square after finding out about Bingo but it was already on my list! 5 stars.

**Myths and Retellings**

*Bea Wolf* by Zach Weinersmith (HM)

The original reason why I immediately bought Beowulf. Zach (from *Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal* fame) tells the first 3rd of Beowulf, reimagined with children, in alliterative verse. It needs to be read out loud. I made my 2 younger children to listen to me read it and the oldest teenager joined of his own volition after 2 nights. 5 stars.

**Queernorm Setting**

*Life is Strange Vol 2 - Vol 6* by Emma Vieceli (HM)

I enjoyed playing the game and found the graphic novels at the library. I quite enjoyed and ended up reading them all in one night. Average 4 stars.

**Coastal or Island Setting**

*A Wizard of Earthsea* by Ursula K. Le Guin (HM) - read before finding out about Bingo

I read a different YA novel so this one could move here. The entire time reading this book I felt like I should be enjoying it but it felt like a slog. It hasn't put me off trying the next book in the sequel. 3 stars.

**Druids**

*Hounded* by Kevin Hearne

I read this book, after finding out about Bingo, specifically because not reading this series was the hard mode of this square and I couldn't seem to find anything else that piqued my interest for it. It was a fine, quick read, but I didn't like the MC and kept getting annoyed how they had to keep cleaning up before the authorities arrived (maybe urban fantasy isn't my thing). 3 stars.

**Featuring Robots**

*Robogenesis* by Daniel H. Wilson (HM)

Found this book in the library after reading the first book in 2020, after reading it because the author was on (or mentioned on the) the *Science Sort of...* podcast. Interesting thoughts about the BBEG doing what they do because there is a worse BBEG coming, the nature of humans, cyborgs, and robots working together. 4 stars.

**Sequel**

*Mona Lisa Overdrive* by William Gibson (HM)

I read Neuromancer late last year and see why it is the pioneer cyberpunk novel, and was in the middle of reading Count Zero when I found out about Bingo. I had time to also finish reading this one a couple days ago. Not as good as Count Zero but definitely worth it. 4 stars.",Fantasy
1711784322.0,The faithful and the fallen by John Gwynne - my overall thoughts,"I read the much hyped faithful and the fallen series some time ago. I was quite excited to read it because I heard so many good things about the books on booktube. Though I did like the series overall, it wasn’t quite the home run I was expecting. 
The characters and the plot are very tropey but Gwynne writes in a way that did not bother me.
What bothered me most was the repetitive plot structure, mainly in the latter books. 
Our protagonists are fleeing the antagonists and take shelter in a new place. The villains lay siege to the place but our heroes are about to prevail with the new found help. Suddenly due to a betrayal, our heroes loose and have to flee again. Similarly, a character wants to avenge the deaths of some loved ones. He almost kills the perpetrator but at the last moment the killer escapes. This happens at least 7-8 times as far as I remember. Also, due to too many action scenes in each book, it looses its novelty quickly. but I must say Gwynne writes action quite well. His character work is also impressive as he made me care for many of the main leads. And I absolutely hated the bad guys. That’s a job well done by Gwynne.
Overall this series was a solid 7.5/10 for me. I have heard good things about his following works and will read them sometime later this year.

1711782338.0,What’s your Favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Opening?,"Liking the rest of the story isn’t required here. What are some Sci-if/Fantasy media openings that just grabbed you? Regardless of if the story dropped off or kept you interested.
Could be a line, a prologue, a scene, an episode; (hell, a sick riff if it’s Sci-fi/Fantasy music you’re into) whatever you’d consider a “beginning” to a story. 

My vote goes to the prologue of Adrian Tchaikovsky’s “Shards of Earth”. Introduced a lot of concepts and characters that got me interested and immediately got me emotionally invested by describing the desperate and sacrificial cooperation of every ship in system. Also was a cool intro for the Architects themselves. 

Honorable mention to the song, “Awakening” by Unleash the Archers. Great fantasy metal concept album imo. ",Fantasy
1711781863.0,Looking for recommendations around an old trope,"Hello, I am a long time avid reader of fantasy, but first-time poster to this sub. I wanted to ask if anyone had any recommendations around an old trope that seems to have fallen more out of favor with recent works. I really like stories that start in quite small villages or places that are out of the way with inexperienced characters that then are taken by circumstances out into a wider world that feels huge and ever-expanding as they explore along with the reader the vastness of the author's setting. Two classic examples of this trope I've read would be the Wheel of Time series and The Dragonbone Chair (Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn), with two recent examples that I read and enjoyed being The Pale Blade (Empire of Flame & Fang) and The Ember Blade (The Darkwater Legacy) - unrelated, but it is kind of funny they both have similar titles. 

&#x200B;

So, if anyone has any recommendations of older or newer fantasy books that are well done and focus on that feeling of widening scope and going from nativity and obscurity to importance and world-shaking events, I'm looking for suggestions. I have read a lot so bonus points for things a bit off the beaten path as I'm more likely to have not read them. Also, while the chosen narrative and prophecy that often accompany this trope are not my favorite tropes themselves, I can stomach them if I like the story or they are doing something interesting with them, like with the Wheel of Time.

1711780726.0,Villains as main characters,"I'm looking for recommendations pertaining to the title.

This is probably a bit outlandish, but I like when events are shown from the perspective of someone that is okay with committing evil in order to achieve their goals. Not cartoonish evil characters just for the sake of evil, but selfish ones that are willing to be evil.

Obviously you have books with lots of main characters, like Game of Thrones, where some of them fit the description, but the atmosphere is broken by other character perspectives. The best I've found so far (and I admit I'm not well-versed in the fiction genre) has been Prince of Thorns and its sequels, by Mark Lawrence.

1711779553.0,"A long shot, is there a book that resembles Assassin's Creed game? (Particularly Mirage)","I'm recently playing the latest Assassin's Creed game Mirage. It's probably one of my favourite games. I love the protagonist, the ancient middle east setting, the vibe of being an assassin running across the city of ancient Baghdad. 

I can't get enough of it and I really want to find a book that can sort of replicate the experience. 

What I wish to find:

1.Desert setting that resembles Persia, ancient Middle East, Arabic culture, etc.

2. Protagonist is some sort of assassin, thief or outlaw mercenary who works in the shadow. 

3. Preferably a male protagonist because the MC in the game is a guy, and that would be my mental image reading the book. 

4. Action packed

**I have already read The Killing Moon (Dreamblood series), which fits the first 3 criteria. But unfortunately I'm not a fan of that story.

1711771485.0,Realm Of The Elderlings - my experience,"I made my way through the series as follows :-
Started with Farseer trilogy and loved it. It’s one of my all time favourites 
Then read the live ship traders but DNFed it as I did not care about the characters or the serpents or the live ships. Maybe I was missing the Buckkeep characters.
Then I read tawny man trilogy and while I did not enjoy it as much as Farseer, it was still at least an 8/10 read. Loved the ending but the first two books had some pacing issues for me.
Skipped the rain wild series as it seemed similar to the live ship series and went straight to the Fitz and the fool trilogy. Again, it was an 8/10 read but not as good as Farseer for me. 
Overall I think this series has some of the most compelling characters of all time. Fitz, Fool, Nighteyes, Burrich, Kettricken are my favourites from the series.

1711768426.0,FIF Bookclub: Her Body and Other Parties Final Discussion,"I’m so sorry for the delay! 

Welcome to the final discussion of Her Body and Other Parties by Carmen Maria Machado. We will discuss the entire book. 

[Her Body and Other Parties by Carmen Maria Machado](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33375622)

> In Her Body and Other Parties, Carmen Maria Machado blithely demolishes the arbitrary borders between psychological realism and science fiction, comedy and horror, fantasy and fabulism. While her work has earned her comparisons to Karen Russell and Kelly Link, she has a voice that is all her own. In this electric and provocative debut, Machado bends genre to shape startling narratives that map the realities of women’s lives and the violence visited upon their bodies.

> A wife refuses her husband’s entreaties to remove the green ribbon from around her neck. A woman recounts her sexual encounters as a plague slowly consumes humanity. A salesclerk in a mall makes a horrifying discovery within the seams of the store’s prom dresses. One woman’s surgery-induced weight loss results in an unwanted houseguest. And in the bravura novella “Especially Heinous,” Machado reimagines every episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, a show we naively assumed had shown it all, generating a phantasmagoric police procedural full of doppelgängers, ghosts, and girls-with-bells-for-eyes.

> Earthy and otherworldly, antic and sexy, queer and caustic, comic and deadly serious, Her Body and Other Parties swings from horrific violence to the most exquisite sentiment. In their explosive originality, these stories enlarge the possibilities of contemporary fiction.

**The Chatelaine by Kate Heartfield (Title With a Title HM, trans male character)**  \-  4\*

A fun retelling of a Flemish folktale that I had never heard of. Having a curmudgeonly older woman as a main character is a nice change of pace. Well, I'm pretty sure she's only in her 30s, but 30s was “older” for a commoner in medieval Bruges.

This is a revised edition of the book previously published as *Armed in Her Fashion* in 2018, and according to the [content note](https://kateheartfield.com/content-note-the-chatelaine/), has ""much less misgendering"" of the trans character than the first edition. I picked up the original from the library to compare, and it's pretty yikes. Claude is a trans man, and in both versions, he's introduced as male and his third person limited sections gender him correctly, but in the original, he's referred to as a ""girl"" in all other characters' sections, both in their thoughts and *by the third person narration*. There's no way I would have finished the book with that version (gendering the trans character correctly *in the narration* is the bare minimum), let alone rated it positively. In *The Chatelaine*, the only times he's misgendered are in dialogue, some of the dialogue mentions are made neutral, and most of the main characters gender Claude correctly in general. With those simple changes, the representation is surprisingly good. It really goes to show how literally just gendering the character correctly goes so far, but hey, it's cool to see the author learning from her mistakes and I'm glad it got fixed.

**Sovereign by April Daniels (Superheroes HM, trans female and nonbinary characters)**  \-  4\*

A solid sequel to *Dreadnought*. Danny is impulsive, angry, and resilient and I love her (>!and I'm very glad she's gonna go get some therapy after this!<).

Trans author. In addition to the trans lesbian main character Danny aka Dreadnought, we also get a nonbinary/genderqueer side character Kinetiq. It may be partly due to the types of books I've been reading this year, but I've been noticing more books with multiple trans characters and I really like that. For one, it helps represent a diversity of trans experiences, but also, most trans people nowadays do interact with other trans people at some point, and there are a lot of interesting interpersonal dynamics involved in that. Kinetiq is a bit of a punk/anti-capitalist trans stereotype, but I don't mind because I personally know people are the same, and I don’t think it’s well known outside the trans community anyways. Danny deals with some on-page transphobia and misgendering >!(plus literal torture)!< from the TERF villain Greywytch, but I think it's handled well and doesn't come off as ""trans trauma porn."" This is partly because we experience it from Danny's POV, and she treats Greywytch with exactly the contempt she deserves, plus the >!torture!< happens early in the book for not-entirely-trans-related reasons and helps set up some arcs (rather than at the end of the book for ""impact"" as it would be with trauma porn). I also thought it was funny how Danny's idea at the end to >!use the wealth confiscated from the billionaire supervillain to provide free transition services!< is basically the same idea as in *Future Feeling* by Joss Lake (>!where a billionaire's kid makes free trans healthcare widely available!<).

**The Will to Battle by Ada Palmer (Bottom of the TBR HM, nonbinary character, genderless culture)**  \-  5\*

*The Will to Battle* is the third book in the Terra Ignota series, and had been on my TBR since 2017. It wasn't the absolute bottom of my SFF TBR (that honor goes to *Words of Radiance* by Brandon Sanderson, added in 2015), but it was the third oldest, and the oldest that fit my theme. I originally wanted to wait for the series to be completed before reading, but by the time the fourth and final book rolled out in 2021, it just wasn't a priority anymore, especially since these books are dense and complex and philosophical, making them hard to just pick up on a whim. But I'm thankful for the nudge to finally read them, because once I started back up, I was hooked all over again.

This series is set in a society where everybody uses they/them pronouns and gender is a taboo subject, so the concept of being transgender doesn't exist. If I had to identify some explicit rep, I would point to Sniper, who would almost certainly fall under our modern definition of nonbinary (which usually falls under the trans umbrella because in our current society, nonbinary people inherently have a gender different from the one assigned to them at birth, but that definition breaks down a bit in a society which does not assign genders at all, let alone at birth). Sniper likes using the ""it"" pronoun instead of the standard ""them"", though they're not sure if they want it for everyday use by strangers/acquaintances (hence why I will use they/them). At the end of the series, >!they get put in charge of a committee to study gender for the first time in centuries and decide whether to re-integrate it into society. Their initial thinking is to start with research, particularly with the divisions in sporting competitions that replaced gender-segregated sports (they are an Olympic athlete so it makes sense they would think to start there, but ugh I'm so tired of the whole trans-people-in-sports debate). They also propose a program for people to take a year to explore gender and talk to others about what gender means, which I think would be pretty cool.!<

**Dead Collections by Isaac Fellman (Magical Realism HM, trans male and nonbinary characters)**  \-  4\*

It's a bit rambly in parts, but it's refreshing and actually hits the cozy/heartwarming vibe better than a lot of books I've tried that specifically target that ""cozy fantasy"" niche. I like the take on vampirism-- Sol's vampirism is more like a chronic illness than anything, and used as a treatment/life extension for terminal conditions; instead of getting super-speed, bodily changes happen in slow motion. This is a perfect fit for Mundane Jobs, especially because the author is an archivist IRL, but unfortunately it's not HM for that so I shoved it in the only other slot I could justify it in.

Trans author. The main character Sol is a trans man. He became a vampire at a year on T, and his changes have slowed to a crawl, leaving him stuck long term in that weird middle ground of not-quite-passing (which happens to plenty of people without vampirism involved). He meets and befriends a fellow Jewish trans man at the blood bank. He falls in love with a person >!who turns out to be questioning their own gender (and ends up settling on nonbinary). I liked getting to see Sol's doubts and dysphoria as Else explores their masculinity while he still supports their exploration and affirms their new understanding of their gender. I'm always wary of books that focus on the cis partner/relative/friend of a trans person, because they so often end up either misgendering or tokenizing the trans person, or trivializing their suffering in favor of the cis person who has it oh-so-hard dealing with a trans partner/relative/friend. But it really can be tough to adjust to someone you know transitioning, so it was nice to see it from Sol's perspective, even if it could have been explored in more depth.!< Fellman also tries to tie being trans to fanfiction writing but doesn't dig too deep into it other than some surface-level stuff about exploring repressed gender feelings through slash fic. I did see some reviews that accuse the book of being lesbophobic for having a transphobic butch lesbian and a lot of lesbian characters that end up being trans (like >!Else!<) or possibly-trans (like >!Else’s dead wife!<), but I think this is just a side effect of having a limited cast and a strong focus on the experiences of transmascs who used to be lesbians. It's not trying to erase lesbians, it's just not really about them, and that's ok. Anyways, some of the themes/connections could have been explored more, but I think the rep is great overall. Plus it's got one of the best trans one-liners I've seen in print (""God misheard my very simple request, so he made me a pianist"") and a possible nod to the Terry Pratchett book ""Feet of Clay"" (which introduced trans-coded female dwarfs).

**Their Heart A Hive by Fox N Locke (YA HM, nonbinary character)**  \-  3\*

I liked the slice of life bits, but wasn't invested in the overarching mystery/plot. I was hoping it would be cozier, but I've been struggling to find books that hit that *Legends and Lattes* niche quite right.

Trans author. There's a genderqueer Lord and Lady of Honeymoore Manor. For most of the book, they seem to be a fairly standard form of genderfluid, swapping between male and female on a regular basis (though not always completely gender-conforming). At the end, it's revealed that they're >!an immortal who has faked their death many times to pose as different people throughout the years, with various names and genders, though none of them fit perfectly. After revealing this, they choose a new name meaning ""daughter of the stone, son of the sea"" and announce themself to be both lord and lady at once (with our modern terminology, they would be considered bigender).!< The rep is fine overall, though it is some of the most binary nonbinary rep I've ever seen, and that's not a compliment.

**The Healers' Home by S E Robertson (Mundane Jobs HM, trans female character)**  \-  3\*

This book didn't hit the cozy slice of life vibe as nicely as the first book in the series, which was disappointing. I found Kei's point of view extremely frustrating to read, with his self-hatred and completely illogical negativity. I'm not planning to read the next book in the series. Fun fact— I was the 100th person to rate this book on Goodreads, so I'm sorry if anybody wanted to use it for Self-published HM.

Trans author. Agna's Aunt Naire is a trans woman (note she has a very small role and I don't think she even gets any direct page time, so this wouldn't necessarily count if you're trying to sub the 2021 bingo square in somewhere). Unfortunately, it's mentioned exclusively in the context of her medical transition making her ""more susceptible"" to certain kinds of cancer. There's a common myth that hormone therapy is ""dangerous"" and increases the risk of cancer, though this is NOT supported by medical research ([source 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214623715000496), [source 2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cen.13835), [source 3](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/827713)). I've seen a lot of parents (some well-meaning but misinformed, some blatantly transphobic) try to stop their kids from getting life-saving medical treatment because of it. Given the harm this myth causes to real-life trans people, I think it's irresponsible to legitimize it even in a fantasy setting.

**The Bone Doll's Twin by Lynn Flewelling (Published in the 00s HM, gender swap shenanigans but no explicit trans rep)**  \-  5\*

I liked this enough that I binged the whole series. No particular book in the trilogy stands out as a 5\* on its own, but I'll give the series a 5 for being consistently well-executed throughout. I liked the characters, and I liked the relationship dynamics, particularly between Tobin and the other noble kids in the Companions.

While I found books exploring nonbinary genders through aliens and far-future worlds in every decade from the 60s to 90s, the options for the 00s were pretty limited. Tobin/Tamir was born female, had their body magically transformed into their murdered twin brother's body, and was raised as a boy before ultimately learning that they are ""really"" a girl and physically transforming back to their original body (I don't think this much is a spoiler as the general story arc is obvious very early on). They're not really trans as we would understand it, but they do go through some similar experiences to trans people. The books generally use he/him pronouns before the transformation, and she/her pronouns after (which makes sense within the story but isn't good practice for most real-life trans people), so I'll just use they/them for simplicity. Tobin/Tamir doesn't show any ""signs"" other than liking dolls and *like-liking* boys. They seem to like their male body, are resistant to the idea of being/becoming a girl, and >!actively miss their penis after it's gone (though it's not clear if that's due to their residual connection to Brother, which causes ""phantom penis"" sensations and is removed/resolved at the very end of the trilogy)!<, but also >!seem to accept being a woman at the end!<. It's not really clear how they would ""identify"" if given the choice, as neither the author nor any of the characters show any awareness of the possibility of being trans. I would've liked to see Tobin/Tamir connect more to other female characters-- there's a hint of it in the way they >!relate to the ghost of the first Queen Tamir, but their friend Una was criminally under-utilized!<. The most relatable part was actually the other characters' reactions to Tobin/Tamir's transformation, in particular Ki (the best friend/love interest) with his struggle to adjust. So overall, the identity aspects were super under-developed by modern standards, but whatever, it was the early 00s. 

**When the Angels Left the Old Country by Sacha Lamb (Angels and Demons HM, nonbinary nonhuman character)**  \-  4\*

This was a fun, easy read with wonderfully endearing characters. I loved the idea of an angel and a demon as chavrusa (Talmud study partners). It was nice to learn some new Yiddish vocab and Jewish mythology.

Trans author. The angel is genderless and uses it/it/its pronouns. It chooses to look like a man for convenience (since women weren't often able to study freely at the time), and it doesn't particularly mind being misgendered. While this was pretty unique, it doesn't really feel like representation because for much of the book, the angel is very non-human and does not think in human ways. However, I did like that even as it takes on a permanent name and becomes more human-like in its thoughts, it remains genderless. The angel and the demon are very close and implied to be more than ""just"" friends, but their relationship isn't necessarily romantic and certainly isn't sexual-- they could equally be interpreted as close friends, as a romantic couple, or as a queerplatonic partnership, which is cool because you don't often see that kind of ambiguous close relationship represented.

**Transmogrify!: 14 Fantastical Tales of Trans Magic edited by g haron davis (Five Short Stories HM, nonbinary, trans male, and trans female characters)**  \-  3\*

This is feel-good trans wish fulfillment, and felt like a spiritual successor to my trans bingo anthology from 2021, *No Man of Woman Born*. Quality-wise, it was a bit of a mixed bag, as anthologies often are, and a lot of the morals/endings were a bit too simple/convenient for my taste, but I enjoyed it overall. My favorites were ""Dragons Name Themselves"" by A R Capetta and Cory McCarthy and ""Espejismos"" by Dove Salvatierra. My least favorites were ""Bite the Hand"" (1\*/DNF since the writing style just didn't work for me) and ""The Door to the Other Side"" (2\* since I finished it, but I really disliked the handling of suicide, especially with its placement as the last story of the book). There were a lot of Harry Potter/JK Rowling references, and a few stories seemed like direct attempts to reclaim certain tropes (e.g. magic schools, broomstick sports).

Trans authors. Story by story, the written representation itself was great, all the way down to the details. It's at the macro level where this anthology suffers. Out of 14 stories, 11 had nonbinary main characters, 1 had a trans girl, 1 had a trans boy, and 1 had dual nonbinary and transmasc protagonists. All of the authors seem to be nonbinary (at least based on their pronouns listed in the bios). Nowhere in the synopsis or marketing is this nonbinary focus acknowledged. I feel like the editors/publishers should have looked at this and gone ""whoops, we accidentally made a nonbinary anthology, let's pivot."" For a general trans anthology that specifically sets out to represent ""many different genders and expressions and experiences"" to include so little binary representation feels like it's saying that binary trans people either don't have a variety of experiences/expressions or don't need/deserve representation. A lot of the characters' struggles were also very straightforward ""nonbinary person finds/makes a place for themself in a binary world,"" which got a bit repetitive.

**The Spirit Bares Its Teeth by Andrew Joseph White (Horror HM, trans male and female characters)**  \-  5\*

I ended up having more YA on this board that I would have liked, just because there's comparatively a lot of trans rep in YA and my choices were limited on some of the squares. I had a bad YA run right before reading this and almost replaced it, but I'm glad I didn't because this was actually really fucking good. I loved the Victorian London setting with a spirit-based magic system.

Trans author. The main character, Silas, is a trans boy. I loved how [Dr. James Barry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Barry_(surgeon)) (a real-life trans man from the early 1800s) is featured as an inspiration for Silas. Silas is autistic, which was also exciting to see because people who are trans are more likely to be autistic than the general population, but I hadn't seen that intersection represented until this year. He meets both a fellow trans person (Daphne, a trans girl and his betrothed) and a fellow autistic person for the first time in this book, and I think the way he sees himself reflected in them really hammers in the importance of representation. I think White also does a good job of highlighting the hazy border between dysphoria about a feature and dysphoria about how society views that feature. For example, before Silas meets Daphne, he's absolutely disgusted by the idea of pregnancy, to the point of researching and fantasizing doing a hysterectomy on himself. After he meets her, he realizes that he ""doesn't actually know how much of \[his\] fear and revulsion is linked to the world's inherent gendering of everything reproductive.""

**Body After Body by Briar Ripley Page (Self-Published HM, trans male and female characters)**  \-  4\*

I quite enjoyed this fever dream of a novel. I don't think it'll ever enjoy mainstream success, and I honestly wouldn't recommend it to most people, but it's a quick read, so if you're in that niche where queer (both in the ""weird"" sense and in the ""trans/LGBT"" sense) anti-capitalist body horror appeals to you and you're fine with some weird sex and vulgar language, maybe give it a shot.

Trans author. This book is set in a future where poor people can access advanced medical care by selling themselves into 7 years of indentured servitude (only a slight exaggeration of the current American healthcare system) with their memories wiped. This deal includes medical transition, but only one-size-fits-all binary transitions, and only people who can fully ""pass"" afterwards are accepted. Even with those stipulations, it's stated that about 89% of the indentured servants are trans. All four of the main characters (3 men, 1 woman) transitioned in this way, though one of them didn't get a fully binary transition despite wanting one (because plot reasons), and another one would have preferred a less binary transition if he were given the option. It's mentioned that rich people have other transition options including nonbinary body mods available, though the general public seems to be transphobic overall. There's some on-page transphobia, mostly in flashbacks as the memory-wiped laborers regain their memories, but it wasn't gratuitous. The book uses terminology that many trans people may find uncomfortable-- for example transsexual/cissexual and references to a trans man's >!cunt!<\-- but at the same time, some trans people do use these terms to describe themselves. Personally, knowing the author's identity is important to me in this situation; I would not feel comfortable with a cis author using those terms, but I'm okay with it from a trans author. On a separate note, I've been seeing a lot of trans authors writing monsters and body horror, and it makes a lot of sense-- you know, something about the experience of being vilified by society and/or feeling disconnected from (or even disgusted by) one's own body leads a person towards certain themes.

**The Bruising of Qilwa by Naseem Jamnia (Middle-East HM, nonbinary and trans male characters)**  \-  4\*

A quick read, it brings up some interesting questions for the reader to chew on but doesn't quite have the page length to explore the answers. I really liked the dynamic of Firuz (the main character) and Afsoneh (their blood magic student)-- I've read plenty of stories from the perspective of the young, naturally gifted protege impatient with their older, more knowledgeable but less powerful mentor, but I've rarely seen it from the POV of the mentor.

Trans author. The main character Firuz is nonbinary, their younger brother Parviz is a trans boy, and there are mentions of minor characters using a few different kinds of neopronouns. Firuz and Parviz come from Dilmun, a queernormative culture where people are introduced with their pronouns (as in, they-Firuz or he-Parviz) and medical transition is readily available, but they are currently refugees in Qilwa, where gender-affirming medical treatment is not readily available. Firuz medically transitioned in Dilmun, and is trying to learn the spells to help Parviz to medically transition as well-- in particular, they are trying to learn to perform a version of top surgery, as Parviz has severe chest dysphoria. This dynamic hits pretty hard at a time (May 2023) when some states in the US are passing laws to limit access to medical transition, which tend to affect younger trans people and people trying to start transition more than older, post-transition folks, and I think Jamnia did a great job of showing Parviz's frustration and desperation and anger.

**The Chromatic Fantasy by HA (Published in 2023 HM, trans male characters)**  \-  5\*

I'm not usually a big fan of graphic novels, but I really liked this. It's whimsical and earnest, the gay romance was cute, and the fantasy trappings (cloaks and castles and all that jazz) in riotous color are exactly my aesthetic.

Trans author. The main characters, Jules and Casper, are two trans men in a relationship with each other, and there's a minor character labeled with she/they pronouns. There are several explicit sex scenes, and I think the author is good at making them look masculine even when drawing them naked without having had any gender-affirming surgeries. I liked the personification of Jules's self-doubts-- in particular, there's a rant about Jules's relationship with his genitals that feels way too specific to be completely made up, which makes the representation feel very personal and real.

**The Last Echo of the Lord of Bells by John Bierce (Multiverse HM, nonbinary and trans female characters)**  \-  4\*

A solid ending to a great series. The number of side character POV chapters was a little indulgent, but it had plenty of the imaginative uses of magic and cute found family vibes that I love the series for. Note: There are *some* doors that lead to other worlds in this multiverse, but I consider this HM because doors aren't the main way to travel between worlds, and I feel like traveling to a different plane via labyrinth is a sufficiently unique method that this deserves HM. And technically, I don't think anybody ever walks through a door to another world in this book (though one character *flies* through one).

I read this book without having planned to use it for bingo and was pleasantly surprised to find some trans rep. There's a prominent nonbinary side character, Shimmering Cardovan, and a minor trans woman (well, minor in prominence, but major in power), Threadqueen Iblint. Shimmering Cardovan is tall, muscular, and bearded, and I appreciate the representation that people can use they/them pronouns without being physically androgynous. Though they're also very flamboyant, and control rainbow gemstones with their magic, so they'd still be considered very queer-presenting by our world's standards. Threadqueen Iblint is the second character in the series noted to have trained in magic to a high level in order to physically transition (the first was Zophor, a mangrove lich briefly mentioned in this book), which implies that medical transition isn't easily available in this world.

**Dawn by Octavia Butler (POC Author HM, nonbinary aliens)**  \-  5\*

This is science fiction at its best. It's got strong themes (consent/control/freedom) and one of the most truly alien depictions of an alien species that I've ever read. I read the whole series back-to-back-to-back.

The Oankali have three sexes, male, female, and ooloi. Ooloi and ungendered children are properly referred to using it/its pronouns, though a lot of the human characters struggle with this and end up using he or she pronouns instead. Oankali children are not sexed or gendered until they reach puberty, and their adult sex depends on their childhood experiences-- children tend to become the same sex as their favorite parent, and the opposite sex of their closest sibling. So in a way, all Oankali children get some amount of choice in their adult sex. In later books, there's a mention of some Oankali-human construct children developing into a different sex than would be expected based on their childhood appearance, but there's no acknowledgement of human LGBT+ diversity.

**The Final Strife by Saara El-Arifi (Book Club HM, nonbinary and trans female characters, trinary-gender culture)**  \-  3\*

The only major character I really liked was Hassa. Sylah was okay, but Anoor was actively annoying. They didn't have much chemistry and I skimmed through a lot of the romantic bits, but to be fair I find myself doing that a lot when reading YA-- and despite the fact that Sylah and Anoor are 20, and my local library shelves this as ""adult,"" it very much reads like a YA novel. The one part of the romance I did like was how >!Anoor cut off the relationship after learning just how much Sylah lied to her about— but I'm sure they'll end up just getting back together in book 2!<. I won't be continuing with this series.

The Wardens' Empire is queernormative, with a trinary gender system of men, women, and musawa. Their god Anyme is musawa, there are several musawa minor characters, and the tritagonist Hassa is a trans girl. The trans inclusion in the world-building felt very surface-level and tacked-on. For example, it's explicitly mentioned out that musawa can use any pronouns, and that anybody can identify as any gender without physically transitioning, which is great, but there's no mention of any way that people might signal their correct gender/pronouns to others, and we never see anybody ask for another person's pronouns. There aren't any musawa-specific terms mentioned for things you might expect like family relations (e.g. mother/father, etc), lady/gentleman, boy/girl, etc. It is mentioned that hormone herbs and gender-affirming surgeries are widely available, but it doesn't make much sense that the oppressed Ghosting servant caste would have easy access to affirming surgeries when they're not allowed to have *hands* or *tongues* (the Embers literally cut them off at birth) and are forced to work as soon as they can walk. That said, I'd rather have a lazy attempt at queernormativity than an even lazier imposition of real-world transphobia.

**Werecockroach by Polenth Blake (Novella HM, nonbinary and trans female characters)**  \-  4\*

This is exactly the kind of story that works well as a novella; there's a fun premise with the werecockroaches and the alien invasion, some solid themes about misfits and found families, and it doesn't overstay its welcome and make you question the logistics too much. I liked Rin's dry humor a lot.

Trans author. The main character Rin is agender, asexual, and aromantic, a combination sometimes referred to as AAA (triple-A, as in the batteries). I don't remember ever reading another book with a AAA character, so it was cool seeing that represented for the first time, especially with Rin being poor and a person of color, attributes which also tend to be underrepresented among trans characters. I liked how all of Rin's identity labels are mentioned explicitly in the book, but in a way that made sense and felt natural. >!Their friend Addie is a Jamaican-British trans woman, but we the audience don't learn she's trans until the epilogue/extra short story from her perspective, which is cool to see. A lot of trans people are not openly trans, either because they are closeted (they live as the gender they were assigned at birth) or stealth (they live fully as their true/target gender), but it can obviously be tough to represent this when all other characters believe they are cis. The best way I know of to represent closeted/stealth trans characters is to give insight into the trans character’s POV as done with Addie. Another option is to go the “Dumbledore is gay” route and reveal the character’s trans status outside of the text. I’ve seen this in The Fated Sky by Mary Robinette Kowel, and while I prefer that over shoehorning in an outing scene, it can make the rep feel “tacked-on” or unsubstantiated.!<

**Dear Mothman by Robin Gow (Mythical Beasts HM, trans male characters)**  \-  4\*

A very sweet book about grief, loneliness, acceptance, and growing up. I'm not generally a big fan of poetry-- I probably would've liked the story better in prose-- but I loved Noah's development, and getting attached to the characters is usually one of the most important factors in my enjoyment of any given book. 

Trans author. The main character, Noah, is an autistic trans boy whose best friend Lewis (also a trans boy) recently died in a car crash. Noah and Lewis were out only to each other, so he has to navigate the loss of affirmation of his identity in addition to his grief. I didn't relate to everything about Noah's experience, but some of the details hit hard, like the way he feels like nobody but Lewis really knows who he is. I liked the connections/themes drawn around trans people as ""monsters"" (""It seems to me that 'monsters' are almost always misunderstood-- that 'monster' is what people become when other people are afraid of them for being different. People like me are called monsters sometimes.""). I also liked how Noah and Lewis were friends before either of them realized they were trans-- I know it seems unlikely on the face of it, but it's a real phenomenon where unrealized queer/trans people are drawn to each other without even knowing what they have in common.

**The Sunbearer Trials by Aiden Thomas (Elemental Magic HM, trans male and nonbinary characters)**  \-  4\*

This is a solid YA book with some fun characters and fun superpowers. The plot is a bit predictable at times, but I'm interested to see how things progress with the next book.

Trans author. This book has a trans boy main character, several trans side characters including a nonbinary god, and a queernormative setting with mentions of readily available hormone therapy and top surgery. I liked how Teo was a role model for Xio— finding trans mentors/role models is really important to a lot of young and/or early-transition trans people, and I don't think we see that represented often enough. I liked how Teo's wing color was relevant to his transition, but I think the way it was resolved was a bit too convenient. I liked how Ocelo is allowed to be nonbinary and a jerk without those things being related. I know those of us who grew up with the queer-coded villain trope may be nervous or skeptical at the prospect, but variety is important for representation, and to me, that includes representing the fact that trans people can be assholes-- not because they're trans, but because they're human. It's also interesting that this is the third book I've read this year that includes a nonbinary deity (Bruising of Qilwa, Final Strife, Sunbearer Trials)-- perhaps it's the other side of the coin to the theme of nonbinary priests/monks from my last trans bingo.

**The Wicked Bargain by Gabe Cole Novoa (Myths and Retellings HM, transmasc and nonbinary characters)**  \-  4\*

This is another solid YA book, and honestly very comparable to *The Sunbearer Trials*\-- I read them back to back, and they would have benefited from more separation. I found Mar's hesitancy to use his powers frustrating (I'm glad Teo's hangups were resolved much earlier in his book). It made sense given his backstory, but it's just not a plotline I personally care for. I did like the Caribbean setting a lot though.

Trans author. The main character Mar prefers gender-neutral forms of address, but while feminine terms feel completely wrong for them, ""man"" is ""not quite right, but \[...\] not entirely wrong"" and boy ""feels better-- good, even-- though it's not completely right, either."" They're fine with he/him pronouns, and prefer to pass as a boy-- if the book were solely from another character's perspective, they would probably seem like a binary trans boy. Nonbinary transmasc guys like Mar are very common and very underrepresented. I've met a ton of trans people who use terms like ""nonbinary man"" or ""demiboy,"" or who identify with terms like ""guy""/""boy""/”boi” but not ""man,"" yet nonbinary representation is still very much dominated by androgynous agender/genderqueer types or genderfluid/bigender types. In fact, the major secondary character Dami is a genderfluid demonio of the latter group (in this world, demons are >!humans who have sold their souls, so they're still human!<) with shapeshifting powers. They're characterized as being very attractive, but well, it's YA, so everybody of a certain age is attractive.

**River of Teeth by Sarah Gailey (Queernorm HM, nonbinary character)**  \-  4\*

The story itself is solid, but it's the basic premise of hippo wranglers in the 1890s Louisiana bayou that really sells this.

Trans author. One of the main characters, Hero, is nonbinary. They're pretty cool, they get a nice romance. I forgot to write this review for several months so my goldfish brain is blanking on the details, but I remember liking the rep overall.

**The Thirty Names of Night by Zeyn Joukhadar (Coastal or Island Setting HM, trans male and nonbinary characters)**  \-  5\*

It was a little hard to get into at first (I often struggle with books with multiple narratives), but the prose was lovely and I ultimately liked it a lot. I saw a review describing it as ""intimate"" and I thought that was a very fitting description.

Trans author. The main character is a transmasc person just beginning to socially transition, and he chooses his name (Nadir) partway through the book. His transition is a major plotline in this story, but it's far from the only thing going on in his life. There's also a secondary nonbinary character, Qamar, and a trans boy mentioned in the past (Laila's notebook) storyline, >!Ilyas!<. As mentioned, I always love seeing trans people connecting with each other. It was especially cool to see the connection between Nadir and >!Ilyas!<, because trans people in history are so often erased. I loved the descriptions of dissociation; it's often overlooked in favor of the more dramatic and overly painful forms for dysphoria. I like the way Nadir's birth name is always scribbled out, making it clear that it's purposefully hidden from the reader. I loved seeing him navigate his nonbinary identity (""I want to tell Reem that maybe I am something there is no word for \[instead of a boy\], but I am afraid that I am already invisible enough to her as it is"")-- he's similar to Mar from *The Wicked Bargain* in that he publicly comes out as a boy but privately feels nonbinary. I love the themes of names and naming, both in a trans context and in a cultural/immigrant context.

**Flowerheart by Catherine Bakewell (Druid HM, trans female and nonbinary characters)**  \-  3\*

Well, it's another YA novel with a magical protagonist afraid of their own powers. I'm really not a fan of this ""super powerful but hindered by anxiety/trauma"" trope, and in general I find it frustrating to read anxious/illogical thought patterns. It also just didn't hit the cozy vibe as much as I wanted.

Clara's favorite former teacher, Madam Ben Ammar, and her apprentice Robin are both trans. Neither of them gets a ton of screen time, but Robin mentions to Clara that they're glad that they have a trans mentor to relate with. On one hand, I like that even with the trans representation being so peripheral, we still get two characters with a hint at how their shared experiences affect their mentor/apprentice dynamic. On the other hand, the whole interaction just feel weird and stilted and poorly executed overall. It also feels iffy to be learning that Madam Ben Ammar is trans secondhand from Robin when it's not entirely clear if Clara knew about her trans status beforehand, but that's partly projection on my part. I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt and assume that this isn't an issue for the characters in question within the queernormative setting of the book, but in the real world, outing people like that is a big faux pas unless you have explicit permission from the trans person in question.

**System Collapse by Martha Wells (Robots HM, genderless non-human characters)**  \-  4\*

I struggled with getting back into this because it picks up right from the end of *Network Effect*, and it had been a while since I read that. Other than that, this was a great addition to the Murderbot series, and I loved getting to see some of that slow burn character development coming through.

Murderbot is a genderless robot-human construct. I think it's in a similar boat to the angel in *When the Angels Left the Old Country* in that it's not really great representation for human gender diversity, because it's not clear how much of its gender (or lack thereof) comes from its non-human side.

**Come Tumbling Down by Seanan McGuire (Sequel HM, trans male character)**  \-  3\*

I've enjoyed most of the other Wayward Children books but had been putting this one off because I wasn't a big fan of Jack and Jill or The Moors in general. It was about what I expected. It was fun enough and quick enough that it was worth reading just for the completionist in me, but it felt gratuitous.

One of the side characters, Kade, is a trans boy who has been featured in several Wayward Children books so far. He doesn't do a ton in this book, but I like him as a character. McGuire has stated (link in comments) that she plans to write his origin story, but Kade is a boy/man ""who will honestly and unflinchingly say that once, he was a little girl,"" so the beginning of his story will have a lot of misgendering and deadnaming, and given ""as little good trans rep as we have,"" she doesn't want to fuck it up. Some trans people (like Kade) do refer to their past selves as their assigned gender, most trans people prefer either gender-affirming or gender-neutral language even when talking about the past. So I understand McGuire's reservations, especially as a cis author who may not get the automatic benefit of the doubt that a trans author might. That said, I've read enough of her work and enough different trans stories in general that I personally would trust her to tell Kade's story well.",Fantasy

1711755853.0,First Time Bingo Reviews 5/5,"21. Queer norms-Swordspoint by Ellen Kushner 3.5 B+


This book follows both an accomplished duelist, famed for his success in mortal duels, from the rougher part of town and a vain nobleman training earnestly in secret to be a duelist as ambitious political machinations unfold among the gentry. I found this book to be an odd blend of rising tension and coziness. It seems pretty clear the two main characters will eventually clash and creates a sort of dread that the more sympathetic MC may die though as vain and shitty as the nobleman was, I kind of enjoyed him, because he was so earnestly vain and shitty. And yet, it was also still oddly cozy to me though I can’t say why. The prose was serviceable and the plot was nothing grand, but I thought they kept the flow well. The strength was more in the characters and dialogue, which were again enjoyable, I could almost always and immediately form distinct images of the characters and feel like I somewhat understood them, but I don’t think any will join the ranks of my favorite. Nonetheless, this was a very enjoyable read and I appreciated both the queernorm setting and that the relationships served a purpose to plot and character development instead of merely being to establish a queernorm setting



2. Coastal or island setting with seafaring- Liveship Traders by Robin Hobb 4/5 A


The pioneer families of a dangerous land had bet it all on a new life. They earned nobility, monopolistic trades, and lost so many lives. Now the noble families are on the decline, slavers are buying their holdings, influencing their politics, and trying to turn their land into a glorified slave colony ruled from afar. A noble family begins to fracture after their patriarch dies and a pirate has ambitions to become a king. This book made me feel things——primarily deep loathing for Kyle. So intense is my hatred for Kyle that I’m afraid I might start being rude to perfectly innocent Kyles in my everyday life. Surprisingly, I don’t hate Malta though. Like Sansa, I’m actually pretty forgiving towards bratty adolescents as they really are just kids and I don’t think readers would root for 14 year-old me as a character even if these two clearly would have been a bitch in high school. I don’t agree with the sentiment that Robin Hobb just likes torturing her characters as their suffering leads to pretty solid character development, but I get where the sentiment comes from. You do spend an inordinate time wallowing in misery with the characters and I literally never expect good fortune to last. I am only one book in, but so far I like this more than the Farseer series, despite this book feeling largely like a set-up for further books. I find the world building much more intriguing, particularly the Rain Wild which I imagine as a cursed, magical Amazon with ruins being excavated. Read if: you like a slow burn with interesting world building, moral greyness, excellent character development, you like a hateable villain, and characters not getting everything they want. Don’t read if: the MC failing or getting screwed over is nails on a chalkboard to you, you want something action-packed, your name is Kyle…you bastard.



3. Druids- The Druid by Jeff Wheeler. 3/5, subjective 2/5. B-/C-



Clearly, I did not have to look hard to find a book for this square. In short, this is a decent, but forgettable book from an experienced author. I didn’t love the magic system. Essentially, if you and your wishes are righteous, God will grant you magical power via “the Medium.” The sinful and self-serving cannot access it, though, if you go that extra mile and are completely evil, you can commune with and allow yourself to be possessed by demons to wield magic. This is all fine I guess, but it not very deep and I hated repeated telegraphing through “The Medium” as in the Medium telling the character to trust or distrust people, which decision is the right one, etc. it completely cuts away any tension or suspense. I also personally lump “all according to God’s plan” in with fulfilling a prophecy as tropes I just find uninteresting and this wasn’t one executed well enough to redeem that (I have some beef with the book of Job as well). Otherwise, there are no egregious literary sins, but also nothing that feels all that original. The characters are also fine, but nothing remarkable. I have read other books by this author and found his Fireblood and Queen’s Poisoner series to be quite good YA. This book feels almost like it was just constructed of recycled bits from his earlier books. After this, my hope is that he will move on past this world. In a word, this book is fine. 



4. Robot protagonist- A Psalm for the Wild-Built by Becky Chambers. 3.5/5 B+


This book was tender and sweet. It centers around a non-binary monk filled with a confusing discontentedness who leaves their life in pursuit of crickets, coming to befriend and travel with one of the thousands of hermit robots who left their programmed life for the wild in a post-factory futuristic world. This is probably my bias coming from the world of medicine, but I would have been happy if the MC remained a tea monk—essentially a traveling priest who listens to people’s troubles and brews teas tailored to soothe them. I do wish we got to see more growth than the sudden leap from fumbling and in over their head to “best tea monk in Panga” which literally were back to back chapters. Holing up for months experimenting with tea blends might help, but it’s the human part, the learning to see and understand people, hone empathy, and ease stress and suffering that I think should have been included. This book brought up a personal distinction for me that I feel like I haven’t quite nailed down yet. This book feels explicitly philosophical more than just heavy-handed. I’m not 100% sure where that distinction lies however. This book does include characters explicitly having a discussion about things like gender identity or identity more broadly. I liked it. I wasn’t blown away by the philosophy, but I thought it was a decent attempt. I could tell Chambers at least put some thought into it and I appreciated the message of simple appreciation for life. This leaves me wondering if my irritation at a book being heavy-handed is more because it is shallow or because I expect them to be more subtle when they choose not to be explicit in their book i.e. anytime a book makes me think “I get it already.” I don’t know. I think I need to think on what the distinction is for me a bit more. I could also seeing this be a big issue for other readers as more explicitly philosophical writing can often fairly feel extremely artificial. This book didn’t quite make it into the A range as far as quality of writing, but I did think it was good. Some nitpicks; I don’t love some of the modern slang in anything set in periods other than present day even if, realistically, some would probably survive in the future. I think this only happens a few times, but it’s nails on a chalkboard to me. I also don’t think it’s objectively an issue, for the most part, just one for me. The non-binary MC was a minor issue to me. It’s not that they were non-binary, I honestly don’t care much one way or the other, but there were a decent number of times, because it was a book, not real life, that I had to puzzle out if the they was referring to Dex or multiple people. I think this is entirely avoidable just by adding more explicit language. If Dex goes to meet someone and then they go somewhere new, make clear if that they is just non-binary Dex, or both Dex and the person they are with. I thought the person that brought their bike was traveling with them for a while. Still, just a nitpick and I enjoyed Dex as a character. I felt Mosscap was mildly endearing, but not really memorable and I think it was a bit more of a philosophical foil than a full-fledged character. I think this book could have been amazing with more work, but it still was good, and gentle, and sweet and worth reading.



5. Sequel- The Obelisk Gate by N. K. Jemisin. 3/5 B



This book is still decent but a bit of a let down after book 1. The story alternates between a middle-aged mother with yet-untapped magical potential as she lives in a community which tolerates magic users and expands her powers and knowledge of the world, with her daughter, a girl with great magic potential following her father after witnessing him murder her brother as a demon as he searches for a place to “cure” her of her abilities. The MC story line I found mostly uninteresting other than some blatant exposition dumps, which stylistically I don’t love, but it was more interesting than anything else going on there. I didn’t feel like the MC herself had much growth and the underlying plot of managing society felt a bit like sitting through actual city council meetings. I loved the daughter’s storyline. It displays the difficult, conflicting nature of reflexive love from a child for parents/parental figures despite witnessing all their flaws and the deep need to have that parental figure. This also confirmed, for me at least, my suspicion from book 1 that Jemisin is making a critical allusion to American evangelicals exporting anti-LGTBQ views to Africa. I couldn’t help but compare her father to some of the brutal things parents have done and still do to “cure” homosexuality. Yet she doesn’t fall into the trap I see so many younger progressive writers fall into by infantilizing them or painting it as a pseudo Garden of Eden myth (society was perfect until they came along.) Nonetheless, as a whole, I’d say this book was decent, not great.",Fantasy

1711752735.0,My final reviews and bingo card,"  

This is my second year of bingo, and it has been great fun. It forced me to finally face the bottom of my TBR pile and read Dune, which unsurprisingly was excellent. The best new series that I’ve discovered through bingo has probably been Grace of Kings by Ken Liu, with shoutouts to Martha Wells and Sarah Gailey, both new authors to me, who I will happily read more of. 

And onto my last line of Bingo Reviews: 

&#x200B;

**Magic for Liars – Sarah Gailey**

**Bingo Squares: Queer norm (HM),** 

Ivy Gamble was born without magic and never wanted it. Ivy Gamble is perfectly happy with her life – or at least, she’s perfectly fine. She doesn't in any way wish she was like Tabitha, her estranged, gifted twin sister. Ivy Gamble is a liar. When a gruesome murder is discovered at The Osthorne Academy of Young Mages, where her estranged twin sister teaches Theoretical Magic, reluctant detective Ivy Gamble is pulled into the world of untold power and dangerous secrets. She will have to find a murderer and reclaim her sister—without losing herself.

**My Review: 4/5 stars**

I enjoyed magic for liars, it’s quite a unique take on the magic school trope; rather than an ancient castle, Osthorne is set as a magic high schools, only full of young mages. Part of what makes this approach so interesting is that we see it through the eyes of an outsider: Ivy Gamble, the non-magical detective, whose magical twin works at the school. In Ivy you feel the longing to be a part of this magical world, even as she denies it. As someone who grew up reading Harry Potter, she was a character I could empathise with, which helped me to understand her decisions as the story progresses. 

Throughout the story, Gailey enjoys subverting various common tropes used in magic school mysteries.  And the mystery is enjoyable, with various hints dotted throughout the story, although it does get frustrating at times that Ivy seems to miss what the writer can already see clearly. In general, I felt the book was well written, and was compelling enough for me to read through quickly. The only area I felt less invested in were some of Ivy’s relationships, whilst the relationship between her and her sister was a core theme of the story, her relationship with other members of the faculty just felt like it detracted from the main story at times, and I was less interested in it. 

&#x200B;

**Tress of the Emerald Sea – Brandon Sanderon**

**Bingo Squares: Coastal Setting (HM),** multi-verse, published in 2023, mythical beasts

The only life Tress has known on her island home in an emerald-green ocean has been a simple one, with the simple pleasures of collecting cups brought by sailors from faraway lands and listening to stories told by her friend Charlie. But when his father takes him on a voyage to find a bride and disaster strikes, Tress must stow away on a ship and seek the Sorceress of the deadly Midnight Sea. Amid the spore oceans where pirates abound, can Tress leave her simple life behind and make her own place sailing a sea where a single drop of water can mean instant death?

**My Rating: 5/5 stars**

This was one of the highlights of my bingo card and was a book I thought was so original in both the story and the telling of it. I’ve read a lot of Sanderson’s work in the past, but the writing style in Tress of the emerald sea felt more whimsical and almost akin to the great Terry Pratchett at times. It still had the unique world building that Sanderson is so renowned for, for example the titular emerald seas are indeed emerald; being full of deadly spores rather than water. This is a world that feels magical, which helps to frame a story that is really enjoyable to read. 

As a story set on the high seas, Tress’s character is quite a contract from the usual morally grey individuals seen in a lot of pirate stories. Tress starts the story as quite naïve and positive, and although she evolves as the story progresses, she remains unconventional in her positivity and heroics. It also makes her interactions with some of the more typical pirates really entertaining. These sort of heroes are often not my favourite, but with Tress it worked. I think part of this was having the story told from a third person perspective. The wit and humour of the narrator can help balance some of Tress’s innocence. As someone who has read books from the wider cosmere universe, I was able to identify the narrator quite easily. However, I think as a standalone book, Tress would still work well as an introduction into Sanderson’s work.

**Bingo Squares: Druids (HM),** mythical beasts, title with a title, mundane jobs

Every druid knows dealing with the Fae is a death sentence. So why would I risk my life to help an evil Faery Queen? A year ago, I swore off druidry, and for good reason. Currently, I spend my days behind six acres of scrap iron, steel, and magic wards, where the fae can't bother me. But when a Faery Queen with God-like magical powers calls, you don't send her to voicemail. Now I have no choice but to find out why evil incarnate has requested my presence. One thing's for sure, if I get dragged back into the supernatural world, there's gonna be hell to pay for it.

**My rating: 3/5 stars**

This is one of those books that I would class as distinctly “okay,” it was an easy enough read, but it never really hooked me. I was happy enough to finish the book, but I doubt I’ll be picking up the sequels. For starters, there are so many elements in this book that feel like they’ve been drawn from other urban fantasy works but done more successfully by other authors (also can we please stop calling every fairy queen in fantasy, Maeve, it’s getting beyond repetitive). The female characters also leave a lot to be desired in both their descriptions and believability. 

I still enjoyed the druid hunting down magical creatures element of the story, and actually I think if this had been fleshed out more the book would really have benefitted from it. The problem (for me) was that too much of the main character’s perspective seemed to be taken up with mourning his girlfriend. Loss can be a powerful tool to build sympathy with a character, but I think it may be more effective later in a series, where for example both the writer and main character are mourning. Instead, I just found these moments whiny and was hoping for the main story to get going again.

**Ancillary Justice – Ann Leckie**

**Bingo Squares: Features Robots (HM),** queer norm

They made me kill thousands, but I only have one target now. The Radch are conquerors to be feared - resist and they'll turn you into a 'corpse soldier' - one of an army of dead prisoners animated by a warship's AI mind. Whole planets are conquered by their own people. The colossal warship called The Justice of Toren has been destroyed - but one ship-possessed soldier has escaped the devastation. Used to controlling thousands of hands, thousands of mouths, The Justice now has only two hands, and one mouth with which to tell her tale. But one fragile, human body might just be enough to take revenge against those who destroyed her.

**My rating: 4/5 stars**

This is one of these books that I can describe as well written, with powerful themes and a really rich setting but for some reason it just didn’t emotionally connect with me. I don’t know if that is because of the non-human main character, Justice of Toren (aka Breq) who’s perspective is extremely well written in that it humanises Breq, whilst still making them seem distinctly alien. Ancillary Justice splits the narrative between Breq’s present, and their past as Justice of Toren. This works effectively, allowing the reader to slowly unpick Breq’s motives, and really feel compassion for their plight. 

In particular, what I found fascinating was the world in which Ancillary Justice is set. This concept of ships that are also expansive Ais, ruling not only their own spaceship, but the thousands of ancillaries aboard is so unusual. And what I really liked is that these aren’t the normal, robotic Ais that we see so often in fiction, instead they have emotions and form attachments; at times going mad when their captain dies. Through the two different timelines, we also see the evolution of this world and how ships begin to change as time goes on. There are various events mentioned, but aren’t really expanded upon until later in the story, which really helps to create this sense of an expansive universe outside of Breq’s own story.

**The Good, the bad and the history – Jodi Taylor**

**Bingo Squares: Sequel (HM),** published in 2023

Max needs to get away - fast - and a Brilliant Idea soon leads her to a full-scale uprising in twentieth-century China. If she can come by a historical treasure or two in the process, even better. That is, if she makes it out alive. Then there's the small matter of Insight - the sinister organisation from the future hell bent on changing History for their own dark ends. Having successfully infiltrated their ranks, Max is perfectly placed to stop them. But she knows her cover will soon be blown - because it's already happened. Can Max take down Insight before they come after her? The circle is closing, and only one can survive.

**My Rating: 5/5 stars**

Do I get an extra hard rating for the fourteenth book in the series? I have loved the chronicles of St Mary’s, and The good, the bad and the history is no exception. It follows on quite directly from the previous books, the overarching story of the past three books coming to a climax. And this book does an excellent job of concluding many of the outstanding storylines, doing so in such an emotionally satisfying way that I was surprised to find that this wasn’t the end of the whole series. 

The Chronicles of St Mary’s is just a great series in general, it is told in such a way that it leaps from action to action, propelling the story onwards and making it so much fun to read. By book fourteen, I have also become so attached to the characters. Whilst Max (the main character) can be a bit much at times, she is balanced wonderfully by the rest of the cast all of whom have created this wonderful found family dynamic that really helps to create the emotional base of an action-packed series. All I would say is, if this review has sparked your interest, please start with book 1 – Just One Damned Thing After Another, otherwise you will be totally lost. ",Fantasy

Jasper Fforde can best be described as a bizarre literary genius. Like Terry Pratchett, he creates fantasy worlds that are bizarre yet coherent, and consistent despite their oddness. Like Douglas Adams, he uses wordplay to great effect, bringing comedy out of illogically sound logic. Take this passage, for example, describing one of the problems currently facing this alternate England:

The problem was this: Prime Minister Redmond Van de Poste and the ruling Commonsense Party had been discharging their duties in such a dangerously competent fashion over the past decade that the nation’s stupidity–usually discharged on a harmless drip feed of minor bungling–had now risen far beyond the capacity for the nation to dispose of it in a safe and sensible fashion. The stupidity surplus was so high, in fact, that three years ago Van de Poste had sanctioned the hideously expensive Anti-Smite Shields, in order to guard against the damaging–yet unlikely–wrath of an angry God, eager to cleanse mankind of sin. It was hoped that building a chain of Anti-Smite Shields at massive expense would lower the stupidity surplus and bring the country back towards the safer realms of woolly-headed complacency.

Unfortunately for Van de Poste, and to many people’s surprise, the Almighty had decided to reveal Himself and, in a spate of Old Testamentism not seen for over two millennia, began to punish mankind for its many transgressions. Damage to people and property aside, this had the unintended consequence of making the Anti-Smite Shield de facto sensible, a state of affairs that required a new and increasingly expensive outlet for the nation’s increasing stupidity surplus.

Tell me that doesn’t ring of Douglas Adams-esque logic. But Fforde stands in a class all on his own, and here’s why: he is able to write about things that can’t possibly be described outside of the realm of written fiction.  There is no real way for most of Fforde’s books to be made into a movie, for example.  His use of wordplay goes beyond simply being used for comedic effect and integrates itself into the world itself.

Some examples: in the Book World, there’s an emergency communication device known as a footnoterphone, which allows people in the bookworld to communicate via footnotes.  There are people who might communicate in Courier New or Sans Serif. There are grammercites, pests that infest books, devouring punctuation (even as you’re reading it). The Book World is simply full of things that can only be conveyed in text, and maybe (MAYBE) a graphic novel.

In another book, Shades of Grey, the entire far future world is based on the inability for people to see color other than a single part of the spectrum (for example, if you can see red, then everything else is black and white except for things with red in it), which not only becomes an element of societal structure (almost Victorian in nature), but medical and scientific technology as well (using colours to treat illness, for example).

How do you convey that on screen?  Simply showing it from one character’s POV with red showing up like something out of Schindler’s List simply cannot do the premise justice.

It’s almost as if he defies the very notion of transferring his stories to any other medium, and so sets up safeguards to make it difficult if not impossible.

The Woman Who Died A Lot is the latest in his Thursday Next series, which had started with The Eyre Affair with the heroine in 1985, and has now come to 2004, with her ageing from 35 to 55, and in really bad physical shape (due to injuries sustained in an earlier book).  This is one of the things I admire about the series. Not only does it have a strong female protagonist, but it’s one who starts off in her mid thirties instead of twenties, and isn’t afraid to let her get older.

The main problem with trying to describe a Thursday Next book is… you can’t. You really can’t. Not without sounding like you should be sent on a paid trip to a pleasant vacation facility with nice soft walls while wearing a snug comfortable robe whose extra long sleeves strap neatly around the back. So let me try it like this. In no particular order of events…

God is recently discovered to be real and is smiting cities around the world. Humans, recently unified under the Global Standard Deity religion (GSD) which manages to accommodate all faiths, are demanding negotiations. An asteroid is en route to earth and might hit us in 2041, but didn’t in an alternate future timeline. Time travel was recently discovered to be impossible and so all the time travel officers have been pre-retired before they were hired. Thursday Next is about to become Chief Librarian of Swindon, which has its own heavily armed Special Forces. There have been several attempts to get secret information from people who know Thursday by using synthetic replicas of Thursday. And, um… someone is destroying random pages from old books written by a drunk lecherous saint for no apparent reason.

Make any sense? No? See, can’t be done. But you have to believe me, when you read the books they make sense. It’s kind of like a far more logical Alice in Wonderland, in the sense that Alice is a Nonsense Story (very popular at one time). The Thursday Next series could also be called a Nonsense Story, except it isn’t… it’s complicated. Rather than just making things up that your brain then struggles to bring logic to (like a third of the words in Jaberwocky), the bizarreness in these books stem from things that you can actually picture, not have to invent.

Despite my jibbering, I highly recommend the entire Thursday Next series, but it is definitely NOT one to jump into in the middle. You need to start at the beginning, The Eyre Affair, and work your way forward. Let the sane insanity worm its way into your brain. It’s amazing how sucked into his various worlds you can get.",Fantasy
1711734017.0,"""Studio Ghibli meets Royal Road"": 'To Fly the Soaring Tides' is a magical adventure in the skies","Here's a recommendation for those looking for a new lighthearted fantasy-adventure series. I've really enjoyed the web serial ""To Fly the Soaring Tides"" by The Chalice.

[Left: \\""To Fly the Soaring Tides\\"" cover. Right: Art of Cira from \\""Chapter 0\\""](https://preview.redd.it/l2amtqhb5brc1.jpg?width=1506&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a80525802e86d742667b27bf0fd0b547c5d3cbb)

It follows sorcerer (not witch or saint) Cira as she travels on the flying ship (re: flying island) her father left her. It's a mostly lighthearted story that focuses on characters but weaves in magic, adventure, and action as Cira travels to new places and meets new people.

While the author describes it as a slice-of-life adventure, I would describe ""To Fly the Soaring Tides"" as more episodic with slice-of-life elements. The story has definite story arcs with no overarching villain or evil scheme, but there is plenty of action, adventure, and even some mystery in its storylines.

There are some minor spelling or grammar errors, but nothing too egregious.

Overall, it's a fun ride with a few deeper themes, and as one reviewer described, it's like ""Studio Ghibli meets Royal Road"" in style. 

""To Fly the Soaring Tides"" is ongoing, with over 1,000 pages on [Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/77056/to-fly-the-soaring-tides).",Fantasy
1711733968.0,What fantasy books have the most interesting cultural clashes?,"I'm looking for fantasy books which have an interesting cultural clash between characters with points of view colored by their respective backgrounds. For example:

* A member of a spartan culture arriving in a european-like market and spending and hour debating the point of earrings.
* Or a zealous character having trouble comprehending that there are other religions.

**A song of ice and fire** does this pretty well, particularly in Daenareys story arc.

Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere books play a lot with this theme and he has a lot of interesting cultures. My personal favorite on this topic is **Warbreaker** which features characters from polar opposite countries trying to understand each other.",Fantasy
1711732816.0,Will of the Many Review,"Just finished The Will of the Many, 3.5 stars. Pretty heavily overhyped in my opinion, but only because a lot of people I’ve seen post have said it was one of the best books they’ve ever read, which is all opinion but still. Also see a lot of comparing to Name of the Wind, which I don’t get at all. 

I’m a sucker for a school/training setting, but compared to other ones I’ve read in the last few years (Red Rising, Grey Sister, Empire of the Vampire, Blood Song) this one felt really shallow. He goes to classes, and that’s pretty much it; not a lot of depth to it. There are the outcast friends and powerful bullies. A teacher or two that doesn’t like him on first sight, it just all felt very rehashed. 

The second half picked up but again, it felt like very familiar territory but not done as well which is exactly the problem I had with the first Licanius book. Like it was 2-3 other stories molded together, nothing really distinguishable as it’s own. I haven’t read either of the next 2 of that series, and I know it’s apparently an incredible conclusion but after this, I think his books just may not be an immediate follow up for me. 

The ending was pretty cool, even if some of the things that happened were pretty obvious earlier in the book, but overall it was still solid.

This was definitely a step or two above that first Licanius one though.",Fantasy
1711731394.0,Bingo (All HM minus 1) +Reviews,"It’s the end of another year of bingo! I felt like I did much less reading this time around since things opened back up to pre-pandemic levels and I wasn’t at home as much. Well without further ado, here’s my bingo card, all hard mode except for one (see the robot square for an explanation haha). As always, please let me know if something doesn’t actually fit.

**Title with a Title (HM: Not a title of royalty):** Starter Villain by John Scalzi

* A fun, modern-day twist on the idea of supervillains, starring a burnt out ex-journalist and his typing (yes, typing) cats. I generally enjoyed it, but I felt that the humour was overdone, with almost every line of dialogue being joke or witty one-liner (a pet peeve of mine).

**Superheroes (HM: Not related to DC or Marvel)**: A Normil Day by Isabel Pelech

* This square was the most challenging as not only do I not like superheroes, but I wasn’t sure my first pick (Starter Villain) actually qualified after reading it. That being said, I liked this novella way more than expected. Despite superheroes being normal in this timeline, the main protagonist isn’t one himself, and has to work to defeat the villain using his own wits.

**Bottom of the TBR (no HM)**: Sword and Citadel by Gene Wolfe

* The second half of BOTNS continues on from Severian’s arrival in Thrax. The scope of the story broadens, and Severian has markedly grown from the first book. The best way to describe this book is confusing and engrossing at the same time, and I’m sad to have finished the series (I know theres a fifth book but from what I’ve heard it doesn’t include a lot of the previous cast?) The first book is still my favourite and I definitely want to go back and reread it sometime.

**Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy (HM: Book other than the 30 listed)**: The Water Dancer by Ta-Nehisi Coates

* A beautiful and thought-provoking book from start to finish. Hiram, an African-American slave, is forced to cone to term with his own memories in order to gain the ability to save others. An exploration of the individual relations torn by slavery, this is easily my favourite book on the card.

**Young Adult (HM: Published in the last 5 years)**: City of Nightmares by Rebecca Schaeffer

* This book is a bit different from conventional YA, with minimal romance and a greater focus on overcoming internal conflict. The world is populated by creatures called Nightmares who are people that have turned into their subconscious fear(s); Ness must figure out how to survive in the world when she herself has a severe phobia of nightmares due to her childhood. I really liked both this book and the sequel, and hope the author returns to the world in the future.

**Mundane Jobs (HM: Does not take place on Earth)**: Cursed Cocktails by SL Rowland

* A cozy fantasy story about a former blood mage’s journey to become a bar owner. Personally, I’ve always wanted a cozy fantasy story with stakes that are just a bit higher, and this book scratched that itch. The next book seems to be focusing on different characters, but hopefully we get to see more of Rhoren and co in the future.

**Published in the 00s (HM: Not in top 30 of list)**: The Magician’s Guild by Trudy Canavan

* Sonea, a girl from the slums, finds herself on the run after discovering she has the ability to use magic, a skill the upper classes keep a tight monopoly on. While I enjoyed the book, it would have been much stronger if the characters had properly fleshed out backstories; at the moment, they come across as flat, and I don’t have much interest in continuing the series.

**Angels and Demons (HM: Protag is angel or demon)**: Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman

* There’s no way I couldn’t use this one for this square, as not only did I see it mentioned all the time online, but my friend irl even recommended it to me after learning that I like fantasy novels. I think I just don’t get British humour since there were quite a few parts that I didn’t understand/find funny, but Shadwell’s parts more than made up for it and made the book worth reading for me.

**Five SFF Short Stories (HM: entire anthology or collection)**: Wyngraf Vol 3

* A collection of short cozy fantasy stories. A lot of good stories, but I think I prefer cozy fantasy in novel format. I’d recommend picking it up on a rainy day, or as a break in between longer or darker novels.

**Horror (HM: Not King or Lovecraft):** Frankenstein by Mary Shelly

* Despite being a fan of SFF I had never actually gotten around to reading this classic. It was interesting to note how the creature is usually portrayed as a mindless monster in the mainstream, while it is actually very eloquent in the novel. Ironically, this seems to be a case of stereotyping based on appearances, despite the dangers of doing so being one of the main lessons in the story. That being said, I don’t have that much sympathy for the creature, since although he was undoubtedly initially a victim of circumstances, he himself chose to become a monster in the end.

**Self-published/Indie Publisher (HM: Less than 100 goodreads rating or done AMA):** The Soul’s Instruments by Mark Holloway

* The second book of *The Aspect* series takes a different direction from the first; romance becomes central to the story and due to Kehlem’s internal conflict, we see much less of the magic system. As someone who doesn’t like most romance and loved the first book because of the magic system, this obviously wasn’t for me, but I can definitely see the appeal in reading about Kehlem and Eva’s relationship deepening while travelling together.

**Middle Eastern SFF (HM: Author is Middle Eastern):** The Queue by Basma Abdel Aziz

* The premise of a dystopian state paralleling the Arab Spring made this a must-read for me. The SFF elements in the novel are minimal, with the focus being on people’s natural susceptibility to manipulation. This was one of those books where I didn’t really feel really strongly about it one way or the other, but its a short read so I’d definitely suggest picking it up if it interests you.

**Published in 2023 (HM: Debut novel):** Seven Faceless Saints by MK Lobb

* After an important member of the magical elite is found dead, two estranged childhood sweethearts wind up working together to solve the murder. I thought this book was a good example of the typical YA tropes used well. Miscommunications in the story are satisfactorily dealt with, and past grievances are slowly forgiven rather than immediately being forgotten for the sake of plot convenience.

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities (HM: Characters are not transported by door)**: City of Bones by Martha Wells

* This had been on my radar for a while, but for some reason, I couldn’t find a copy at all until the revised version released. The story follows two people from vastly different positions in society who wind up working together to solve an archaeological mystery. Its a bit slow to start, but picks up in the second half. I overall enjoyed it, but I did feel that the characterization was a bit weak, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind certain actions.

**POC Author (HM: takes place in futuristic, sci-fi world)**: Immortal Longings by Chloe Gong

* One gripe I have about YA is that too many books try and shoehorn a battle royale in even if it doesn’t fit with the plot. I think this book would have worked better as a break-in/infiltration story, since the initial premise of becoming the victor for the opportunity to assassinate the king doesn’t make much sense. Wouldn’t the king have security at any public event? That aside, I liked the blend of fantasy and sci-fi.

**Book Club or Readalong Book (HM: must participate in discussion)**: Lonely Castle in the Mirror by Mizuki Tsujimura

* This is exactly the kind of book I needed in high school and one that chronically absent kids will definitely be able to relate to. Seven students who refuse to attend school, all for different reasons, are brought together to find a key in a magical castle. The main twist felt fairly easy to guess, but I wasn’t expecting the lives of the characters to eventually intersect in the way they did. An immediate favourite.

**Novella (HM: Novella is not by Tordotcom):** Gardens by Benedict Jacka

* So even though I think this book was much weaker than the mainline series, I’d still highly recommend it for fans of the *Alex Verus* series since it gives much more satisfactory answers for what happens to Anne

**Mythical Beasts (HM: No dragons or dragon-like creatures)**: The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by Shannon Chakraborty

* I really liked the idea of this story, one of a retired-pirate-turned-mother called back for one last adventure, but for some reason I just couldn’t get into it. One criticism I had was that I felt like the author tried to balance wish fulfilment with commentary on female empowerment in a sexist society; no characters face any sexism on-page and despite Amina claiming that she struggles to gain respect because of her gender, every man she meets immediately accepts her as at least an equal if not a superior. That being said, it was a fun adventure story and you can definitely tell how much care the author put into it.

**Elemental Magic (HM: Not Shades of Magic or Codex Alera)**: The Thief’s Gamble by Juliet E. McKenna

* An extremely underrated book that I never would’ve discovered if not for bingo. A group of mages attempt to solve a mystery relating to old magical artifacts, but wind up unearthing more than they were expecting in the process. It is technically a multi-POV (one in the 1st person, the rest in 3rd) epic fantasy, with some parts in the beginning being difficult to follow, but it still contains a classic adventure story that appeals to those who prefer sword-and-sorcery-like novels.

**Myths and Retellings (HM: Not Greek or Roman Mythology)**: Daughter of the Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan

* A retelling of the Chinese legend of Chang’e. I initially wasn’t sure if this book would be for me— the synopsis had me believing the story would be on a more epic scale— but it had me hooked right away and I really enjoyed reading about Xingyin learning to adapt to her new surroundings. I do feel as though it lost some of its charm when we were introduced to the main antagonist in the latter half and the stakes got higher; I’m currently in the middle of the second book and not enjoying it as much as the first unfortunately.

**Queernorm Setting (HM: Not a futuristic setting):** Foxglove King by Hannah Whitten

* The story begins with a gang member of sorts with an affinity for death magic being hired by the King to infiltrate his court as a spy, although this premise honestly makes very little sense since the girl in question is completely unqualified for the job. Despite being marketed as adult, this book felt like the stereotype of badly written YA, with the writing being repetitive and the plot only consisting of a love triangle. The author’s treatment of deformities was also absolutely terrible, bordering on offensive, to the point where I honestly just wish I could just throw the book out.

**Coastal or Island Setting (HM: Also features seafaring):** The Battle Drum by Saara El-Arifi

* Book 2 in the Ending Fire Trilogy sends Anoor and Sylah on two separate journeys. Although I loved the first book, *The Battle Drum* suffered from second book syndrome with the plot feeling drawn out. The ending really redeems it however and I can’t wait for the final book to release!

**Druids (HM: Not Iron Druid Chronicles):** Sun of Blood and Ruin by Mariely Lares

* I’m sorry but this book really needed better editing. While it is supposed to involve a noblewoman leading a double life as a rebel, we never really get any background info on either of her identities; they seem to only exist as an excuse to move the plot forward. Many parts of the story didn’t make sense, the characters were very two dimensional, and the worldbuilding was lacking. It definitely had a lot of potential but there’s just too much missing from it unfortunately.

**Features Robots (Not HM):** In The Lives of Puppets by TJ Klune

* If you are wondering why this is the only square not hard mode, it is because I didn’t realize this square existed until I was putting together my card. Considering there were 6 days until the end of bingo and I had a surgery the next day at the time of writing this, I realized I’m probably not going to be able to read another book for HM. Anyways, I really enjoyed the Lives of Puppets since the whole “group of friends travelling on a journey together” trope appeals to me. While the story is meant to be a retelling of Pinocchio, I felt “influenced” might have been a better word to describe it; while the characters seem to have been based off the original, the storyline has its own unique twist.

**Sequel (HM: Book 3 or more)**: The Farthest Shore by Ursula K LeGuin

* The third book of *Earthsea,* I know people say it is the weakest in the series but I personally enjoyed it more than the first. The second is still my favourite though and I am looking forward to reading *Tehanu* and learning what became of Tenar.",Fantasy

1711730455.0,Para's Proper Reviews: Of Sorrow and Such by Angela Slatter,"Since this is a novella, and not a very long one at that, I honest to god thought this would be a normal, quick mini review. But then it got away from me. I kept typing. And typing. A paragraph, then two, then more, and here we are.

It’s funny that coincidentally, both novellas I read recently, this and *The Woods All Black* by Lee Mandelo, are revenge stories. Both about people who have been wronged and oppressed getting back at a bunch of religious bigots. *Of Sorrow and Such* perhaps a little more typical, and not quite as well done (if I 100% liked it, there’d be less to write), but still very angry and very enjoyable.

*Of Sorrow and Such* in particular is about the violence women face under patriarchy, from their lovers, their husbands, random men, not everyone of course but far too many. Patience Gideon is a witch serving as a herbalist and medicine woman in the little town of Edda’s Meadow. Due to the general attitude towards witches, she, her (completely non-magical) adopted daughter, and her dog must keep a low profile to avoid being burned on a pyre, but when she decides to help a selfish, thoughtless shapeshifter girl against her better judgement, things escalate fast.

> *“My girl, my darling girl, don’t wish for what I’ve got—a witch’s life is made of sorrow and such. Be happy you’ve a chance at something else”*

I always appreciate books with older protagonists (50+ in this case). I also liked that Patience is *not* nice and has done some fucked up stuff in her past which she feels no remorse for, but she does her best to protect the women of Edda’s Meadow and the people they’re up against are so much worse, it doesn’t really matter.

The only thing I didn’t like is the undercurrent of “medicine and doctors bad, herbalism good.” Of course Patience is a competent witch and the doctor is a misogynistic asshole, but reading this in a time where the anti-vax sentiment is on the rise, and having encountered enough alternative medicine crackpots myself…it puts a bad taste in my mouth. Where’s that Ursula Le Guin quote about not making a cult of women’s knowledge again?

Either way, the afterword says there are a sort of prequel and epilogue among the Sourdoughverse short stories, so I suppose I need to get around to those!

1711726823.0,Bingo round up,"I did the standard card, within a decent mix of hard mode. Finishing was kind of hard because I ran out of steam and didn't realize some other books I had read qualified. I've posted reviews of a few of these on r/Fantasy already.

Row 1:

Title w/a title: Priest of Bones

One of the first books I read for this years bingo. I love the world and characters in the core cast. My only real disappointment was the incredibly strange attempt at romance towards the end. 4/5

Superheroes: Vicious by V.E Schwab

I fun turn on superhero stories. I like how it fiddles with the fact that so many superhero stories involve trauma. A good read, but I felt the sequel left a bit to be desired. 4/5

Bottom of the TBR: Black Wolves of Boston

A big thank you to my sibling who is also a member of r/fantasy. I hate buying books, but the library didn't have this one. And it was literally the oldest book on my Goodreads list. I enjoyed the book as expected, but the sexual tension with the vampire just felt icky. It kept going back and forth between mentor/ guardian and vague horniness. I would have preferred if it was handled a little bit differently or if the teenage boy was a little bit older. 3.5/5

Magical Realism/ Literary fantasy- by Mona Awad

I don't what I was expecting, but it definitely was not that. I dislike unreliable narrators and this book had several screws loose. Maybe if I was an English major back in the day? 2/5

Young Adult- Legendborn by Tracey Deon

For \[redacted reasons\] the college the author chose was a particular haha for me. I usually don't like >!King Arthur!< imagery. The main thing that made it feel YA was the love sub-plot. A YA isn't complete without possible competing love interests. Thankfully other elements of the book, the MC's relationship with her family made up for it. 4/5

Row 2:

Mundane Jobs: No gods for drowning

I think I will let my rant review when I had read it more recently stand. You can find it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/13zdrmd/review\_round\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/13zdrmd/review_round_up/) 2 stars. Reluctantly.

Published in the 00's- City of Saints and Madmen

I read this book because it was on my TBR for reasons I no longer recall, but I think those reasons involve reddit somehow. Going into this book blind was an \*experience\*. This book was made up of several smaller stories. I liked some of them more than others. One of the stories is meta and mentions the real world, rather than Ambergris. Which amused me. 3/5- Do not read if you looking for something fast and zippy.

Angels and Demons- Chip Zdarsky

I read a comic book and no one can stop me. Mwahahaha. I really liked the take on religion and I loved that the main character who was kidnapped into importance was basically an uber driver. 4/5

Short stories- Fifty beasts to break your heart by GennaRose Nethercott

I'm not going to review each story individually. I was a fun collection, but I thought the title story was not the best story. Sundown at the Eternal Staircase was my favorite. 4/5

Horror: Dead Eleven by Jimmy Juliano

I probably changed this square around the most. Apparently I read too much horror this year. This book was insane from start to finish. I loved all the 90's references and epistolary elements of the book. I thought the way the author handled beliefs in relation to the horrors that were happening was really cool. I genuinely felt dread when the characters went in the ""bad building"".

Row 3:

Self Published: Magic Claims by Ilona Andrews

Like many Andrews fans, I will read their cake recipe if they give it to me. I have a problem. This wasn't my favorite recent Andrews book, but it was definitely good. I'm enjoying the change in locale. 4/5- Not recommended unless you are already a Kate Daniels fan.

Middle East- The Adventures of Amina al- Sirafi

More. I need more. Immediately. The narrator. The friendships. The boat. >!The ominous baby daddy!<. The setup for sequels.  5/5

Published in 2023- Book of Night by Holly Black

The magic was well done and didn't feel info-dumpy. The author did a half decent job of making the character suffer without it becoming misery porn. 4/5

Multiverse: Library of the Unwritten- A.J Hackwith

I fell in love with the multi-dimensional library and it's residents. It's one of the few books I've read recently where I can actually remember the characters names. They cared about each other and showed it, in rather dramatic fashions. I literally rationed the sequels because I was not ready to say goodbye. 5/5

POC author- Ebony Gate- Vee & Bebelle

An awesome story with a cool sidekick. Unlike some stories, the MC felt established in her world, rather in page 1 being day 1. My main complaint at the of reading was that the very beginning felt a bit info dumpy. I'm still not sure if all the terms in the info dump were made up or if any of it has a basis in asian mythology. 4/5

Row 3:

Book Club- The very secret society of irregular witches- Sangu Mandanna

I didn't even realize this was a book club book until after I read it. I got a kindle copy as part of a giveaway. The story was cute and I would definitely call it ""cozy.""  I enjoyed the reading experience but it felt sort of shallow. The twists didn't fully surprise me and I didn't feel the need to advertise to my loved ones. If you like children this book is good for a rainy day while you drink hot tea and think about attractive grumpy dudes. 3/5

Novella- Starter Villian- John Scalzi

I really enjoyed this book in a light hearted way. I reminded of british humor with the unionizing dolphins. I did feel like the ending was a bit too pat and convenient. I needed the MC to experience more stress/ grow as a person. 4/5 stars, but 0.5 of that is probably because I like cats and am obsessed with the cover.

Mythical Beasts- All the Murmuring Bones- A.G Slatter

I think fell a little bit in love with this book. The author did an amazing job creating and filling a world without feeling an info dump. The story itself felt like a brand new fairytale with the falling down house and the family that loses success. It felt a bit like the fall of the house of usher, but not so much that I made that connection while reading.  I definitely plan to read more by this author. 5/5

Elemental magic- The reluctant queen by Sarah Beth Durst

Once again in this series, I love the setting. The completely murderous elemental spirits that essentially need a Disney princess to tame them. And the whole living in trees thing. Amazing.  But the characters this series never feel like they reach full depth for me. There was literally a mind control subplot and I just did not care enough. 3/5

Myths/ retellings- Bryony and Roses- T. Kingfisher

I may or may not have a T. Kingfisher problem. I kept rotating which book by this author I was going to use for a square. I enjoy how clever her books make me feel and the characters actually have some depth. I could feel T. Kingfisher's personal passion for gardening in this book. And liked that Beast was actually allowed to have a hobby in this version, beyond just reading. 4/5

Row 5:

Queernorm: Cassiel's Servant- Carey

I was so excited for this book! And it mostly held up to my expectations. I was really happy that the author made a point to start the story at the same as phedre's (aka childhood) rather than starting it when they meet. Joscelin felt more 3-dimensional and I walked away feeling like I got his side of the story and a better understanding of his belief's and reasons for his actions. 4/5

Coastal/ Island- Ferryman by Justin Cronin

A fun science fiction by an author I've enjoyed in the past. I enjoyed the setting and I felt like the narrator had a distinctive narrative voice. I enjoyed the slow menace as the MC learns more about retirement. I will admit the whole coming back as teenagers thing was a unique twist. Unfortuntaly, most of the other twists felt like they had been done before/ weren't truly unique and surprising. 3.5/5

Druids- Dark Mirror by Juliet Marillier

My hardest square to fill just about. My library didn't have any of the right books, so I had to raid a family member's office while explaining why I was looking for druids. Then, for extra confusion I discovered Marillier and Carey enjoy researching the same history. Some of the same titles were used like ""Drust"" so it felt like I was reading an incredibly weird fanfic. I liked the characters, but plot was a bit chosen oney. I would have preferred if there was a better competition for who was going to be crowned. Maybe a closer runner up. Also moving your castle will not prevent the need for >!human sacrifice.!< 3.5/ 5

Robots- System collapse by Martha Wells

I was so relieved to realize there was another murderbot book coming out. I don't read robot books very much. Unfortunately, I just didn't enjoy this one as much. Murderbot kept redacting themselves for privacy reasons which was annoying, and it kind of felt like a bridge book. Cleaning up after one book and setting up for the next. I prefer my murderbot more self contained. 3/5

Sequel- Labyrinth's Heaty- M.A. Carrick

The first one of these I read in physical format. I didn't realize how big they were when reading on my Kindle! I loved this book so much. I desperately want to learn how to dance the canina and I think the Rook would be amazing as an animated character. I appreciated how much energy the authors put into making the characters feel real and not forcing annoying love triangles. 5/5

The End!

Next year, I want to set myself a challenge. I'm planning on trying to read several books I already own but I'm also considering giving myself the dopamine challenge. Basically, if it's less than 3 stars and I'm part way in, I would put it down instead of finishing it for bingo. We'll see.

Review originally on [JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/bluebird-by-ciel-pierlot)

 

*Bluebird* is a delicious space opera novel written by Ciel Pierlot, and published by Angry Robot Books. Just from the own blurb, you can get it's going to be rompy and chaotic (let's be honest, who doesn't want lesbian gunslingers in the space?), and it is, but it also encloses a powerful and emotional story about accepting your own identity and breaking against the established conventionalism.

Rig, a talented weapons developer and gunslinger, abandoned her faction and lives as a thieving rebel and gunslinger; her girlfriend, June, is a sexy librarian, and life is going well. However, her former faction needs what Rig stole from them, and as a way to coerce her into collaborating, they have kidnapped her twin sister Daar; they will torture and kill her if Rig doesn't collaborate.  
However, instead of forfeiting to her faction, Rig decides to start a journey across the galaxy, ready to fight and hopefully, finish the tyranny of the factions that are competing over the universe. And she won't be alone, as, apart from being armed with panache and pizzazz (her bio-coded guns), she will be accompanied by Ginka, a mysterious agent of the Ossuary faction whose past is the key of her identity, and the rebels she was working with.

Despite the big scope of the plot, Pierlot manages to make this novel more about the characters and their identities; Rig and Ginka are fighting to make their self-identities to be accepted, and to destroy the system that is trying to encapsulate them into others since they were born. The banter between Rig and Ginka is delicious, a sort of reflection of the unlikely friendship that gets established between them; and between Julia and Rig we can appreciate the passion and the steam, a show of love.

The writing is clear and fast, with exceptionally well-written action scenes; pacing is quick, adequate to the urgency Rig is moving to. Many bird references are included, and the humour is top tier, found myself laughing many times.

*Bluebird* is a great space opera; fulfills perfectly the ""chaotic lesbian gunslingers in space"" pitch, a fun and entertaining read with an excellent and clear prose. Won't be my last read from Ciel Pierlot.",Fantasy

1711723721.0,R. J. Barker is an amazing writer (Gods of the Wyrdwood),"I hadn't picked up a fantasy book in quite some time but this story is reminding me why I love it so much in the first place. Only read about 30% of the book so far but I'm truly impressed by the writing. Just so elegant, detailed and engaging. Should definitely have more hype.",Fantasy
1711721663.0,Stormlight archive - my enjoyment is steadily declining,"Not a diehard fan of Brandon Sanderson but I absolutely love Warbreaker, Elantris,the final empire, Way of kings and Words of radiance.
Stormlight archive was one of my favourite ongoing fantasy stories until I read Oathbringer and Rhythm of war. I didn’t enjoy these two books as much as the first two. I found serious pacing issues , repetitive plot points and character arcs really bogged down these two books. Kaladin still moping about.. Shallan struggling with multiple personalities in almost every book.. one of our heroes speaks an ideal to power up and save the day when all hope seems lost.. these are some plot beats that are starting to grate. Also the shadesmar of way of kings and words of radiance felt eerie and alien.. turns out it’s mundane. Many seemingly filler chapters really hampered the pacing in the latter 2 books. Worldbuilding is now explored at the expense of fresh and engrossing character arcs. I still don’t care about the Parshendi. This is making me worried about book 5. Hope Sanderson turns things around.",Fantasy
1711721567.0,I don’t know how I feel about Chorus of Dragons by Jenn Lyons,"Im busy reading the series now, and I really enjoyed the first 3 books. However the fourth is becoming a slog to get through.

*Spoiler Warning for those who haven’t gotten far into the series*

I liked where the plot was going with Khirin going to confront Vol Karoth, like he was facing this terrible thing that had become almost a crippling fear (but rightfully so). But the gight has just been dragging on with the memory flashbacks and nothing is getting resolved. I understand the showdown wasn’t supposed to be easy, but the back and forth of ‘the worlds bad’ and ‘no but friends’ is terribly boring.
This is a big part, but also the stupid leniency to the shit that people pull is annoying me. Qown betrayed everyone, but Galen doesn’t seem to care. Xivan is a terrible person, that has proven multiple times she’s willing to sell out everyone and everything but never seems to face the consequences cus people just forgive her or don’t address it. Plus the sudden complication of Khirin also being in love with Teraeth is just making it all so convoluted.

I’m unsure of wether it not I want to continue, because like I mentioned, it’s becoming a chore to read but I feel like it’s a waste cus I’ve already  read up to the fourth book.

1711721426.0,A question regarding gender and writing fiction,"Okay.. I intend this to be a legit discussion, and I might be wrong but I’m genuinely curious to her other people’s thoughts on this topic.

I’ve noticed, when looking at my favorite characters or character driven books of all time it’s often written by women; Hobb or Bujold.

And often my favorite plots plot driven books are written by males; Sanderson, Gwynne.

Now this might be a total coincidence on my part. But I’m curious if other people have had the same experience. Do you think women (on average) are better at writing characters and men (on average) a plot?

This isn’t intended as a dig towards anyone in any way, and is more just a curious thing I’ve thought about recently",Fantasy
1711718870.0,Looking for fantasy and space opera-ish sci-fi/fantasy recommendations,"Hi all. Firstly, thanks for giving this post a look. So let me narrow down my genre preferences and what I've read recently, so you can tailor your potential recommendations.

Genre preferences:

* I love most things Epic/high fantasy and space opera.
* Dark fantasy - (grim dark to a lesser extent)
* I'm willing to give it a go for almost any fantasy, or sci-fi sub-genre if the book/series seems super interesting. (except for romantasy though. I'm too old for that stuff now)

Some examples of what I've read recently:

* Malazan Book of the Fallen
* The First Law trilogy
* Wheel of Time
* All the Brandon Sanderson stuff
* Hyperion Cantos
* Dune
* Remembrance of Earth's Past

I'm kind of in a pickle at the moment as I straight-up read/listened to around 20 books set in the Malazan world. There are a few more left, but I cannot read any more of it for a while. Same with Joe Abercombie and Brando I think. I have read from most authors in this epic fantasy space except for GRRM (I kinda know most of the plot points by now. That's my only reason for not picking up ASoIaF), Robin Hobb, and Terry Pratchett. I've heard good things about the latter 2, so if you can give me a good starting point on them, it'd be awesome too.  In the Sci-fi genre, I'll be really interested in something like Dune or Foundation that makes you want to contemplate it years after reading. Or even something like almost cosmic horror in Remembrance of Earth's Past.

I mainly listen to audiobooks these days.

If there are particularly weird ones, I think I'll interested regardless of the sub-genre. I just want to see complex and well-thought-out representations of cultures, magical systems, world-building etc.

As you've probably surmised, I already have a crazy backlog. I'm willing to explore other genre-adjacent stuff as well. I guess what I want is to get other's perspectives and order/update my reading list for the rest of the year. Many thanks in advance.

1711715458.0,[SPFBO 9 Review] The Last Fang of God by Ryan Kirk,"&#x200B;

“When gods refuse to die, it's humans that suffer.

Safely hidden deep within the endless fields of his late wife's people, Kalen's only dream is to live the rest of his days in peace. He paid for his dream in blood, but neither his sword nor service are demanded any longer.Chaos erupts when his daughter, Sascha, is called by Kalen's old master. Father and daughter have no choice but to leave the home they've created for the land of Kalen's birth.But the sins of the past cast long shadows. After years of a tenuous peace, gods and humans alike resume their quest for dominance. Kalen and Sascha find themselves in the midst of a struggle that will reshape the boundaries of their world.The warrior who wants nothing but peace will be forced to draw his sword once again.Will it be enough to protect his daughter from the whims of the gods?”

This book ends far too soon, I wish I could live more in this world and continue to learn. This book has a very strong start with very interesting world building elements but there are some limitations that it is a standalone which affected my enjoyment of the book. I do love the Norse inspiration with strong character motivations. The love that is between the father and daughter is really shown within these pages.

**So what worked for me?**

World-Building: The world is interesting with different concepts that are highly enjoyable. However, the length of the book did work against the full development of these ideas. I would have loved to either have a longer book to flesh out the hidden lore that is discovered or a planned sequel to learn more about the world. I would particularly love to see more of the magic of rune casting.

**What did not work for me?**

While I would normally narrow down to a particular element that did not work for me there was nothing that particularly stuck out on what did not work for me. It was a more generalized feeling that there wasn’t enough for me to fully love the novel. There is a lot to love with rune casting and hidden world of the gods and the reason behind motivations. However there was too much to do within a few hundred pages.

**Recommendation?**

This would be a good book for a quick read. If you a world building reader this would 100% be up your alley. I am interested to read more by this author and to see what is in the future.

**Score: 6.2/10**

Character: 7

Plot: 7

World-Building: 7

Writing: 5

[A character made to feel ashamed of his birth.](https://preview.redd.it/t4odgyaf89rc1.jpg?width=318&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=41de9f98caee27e88ebe45ba2780a70cbc181a4f)

https://beforewegoblog.com/tanis-half-elven-was-a-deeper-character-than-i-thought-warning-sa-ca-discussion/

[The ""Perfect Victim"" thread had a discussion of DRAGONLANCE in it](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1bq1706/the_perfect_victim_how_we_talk_about_sexual/) and how one of the main characters rather notably drops a huge bomb on the reader with no preparation as like the second thing you learn about him. Specifically, Tanis is the product of sexual assault. It's very off putting and seems out of place in a PG-13 series (at best) series that so often tends to be treated as goofy, especially compared to its sequel in DRAGONLANCE LEGENDS. However, I keep returning to the character because as an adult I've realized he's a character dealing with a lot more than generic angst. So I brought some of my thoughts to their own thread.

Tanis Half-Elven is an interesting case where the actual subject being discussed, child abuse, is something that gets almost completely ignored because the subject of his existence dominates discourse about him. Ironically, for the same reason that he's a victim of child abuse and the tool used to injure him emotionally.

Tanis is constantly thinking about the fact he's a product of sexual assault (the retcon about his origins being consensual is one that was made by executives against the will of the main series' authors and ignored subsequently) because he was reminded of this fact every day by his adoptive family. It was a way of them exerting power over him and destroying his self-esteem while also engaging in some microaggressive racism that made his family feel more righteous for ""ignoring"" it. This is VERY familiar behavior to me because I happen to know someone very intimately who grew up as the product of an adoptive household that treated them with this exact behavior for this exact reason and it was constantly on their mind. She was hardly alone too as the family loved using their bad births to cudgel them daily.

Margaret Weis has been pretty clear the influence that fundamentalist behavior was the origin for a lot of Dragonlance's choices like the fact it was the height of the Satanic Panic that she created things like the Istar civilization to critique. But almost no one even seems to realize Tanis is a subject of child abuse because they're dismissive of his experiences, unaware that he's one of the most realistic portrayals of someone subject to fundamentalist foster family trauma.

The biggest issue is a lot of readers are unable to focus on Tanis' own trauma because, well, they feel like the books are dismissing the trauma of Tanis' mother who never shows up as a character. The SA's effects have echoed out and we see only how it's affected Tanis because his mother's family has never let him forget it.

Tanis is a character that is a rare one in that he became one I appreciated a lot more as I got older that I originally dismissed as a lot less nuanced than, say, Raistlin. However, he's a character that can be read as having escaped a fundamentalist society and attempted to build his own found family away from the expectations of his racist domineering childhood. So much of the man's character development consists of, ""I want to avoid dealing with the people that raised me as much as humanly possible. Because calling them out is pointless and they will never understand how they hurt me and I have so many mixed feelings regarding them."" It's something that's incredibly subtle and authentic that reflects the reality of extended family members I know in a series that is, well, not usually very subtle at all.

It even affects the much-maligned love triangle element as he just wants to start fresh and his childhood sweetheart wanting to resume their past together just brings up painful memories. Tanis can't imagine that Laurana, for example, has her own issues stemming from growing up in elven society.",Fantasy

Here's my 2023 bingo wrap-up with some impressions of each book. Second try tonight, this time with no duplicate authors! The star ratings given are gold for Hard Mode and silver for regular bingo. I rated based on my expectations for each book - manga is rated against my expectations for manga, romantasy is rated against my expectations for romantasy, YA is rated against my expectations for YA, etc.

**Title with a Title (hard mode)**

*The Sunbearer Trials* by Aiden Thomas

* Intriguing worldbuilding with gods integrated to life on Earth, really beautifully explored
* Touching exploration of gender identity and transition
* Wholesome characters and relationships written in quintessential YA style
* The Sunbearer Trials themselves were well written, leading to a subsequent higher stakes world conflict (yes, think Hunger Games) that will be explored in the sequel. I have added the sequel to my TBR.

**Superheroes (hard mode)**

*Sailor Moon vol 1* by Naoko Takeuchi

* We all know her, we all love her, pure nostalgia, I am not taking criticism at this time

**Bottom of the TBR (hard mode not applicable)**

*The Three-Body Problem* by Cixin Liu

* I'd procrastinated this one *hard*. My partner loves it (so I felt the pressure to like it too) but it's dense science-y hard sci-fi when I'm usually more of a character-focused reader...
* But I loved it! All through the series the science is bonkers in the best way. This novel perfectly set up Dark Forest, #2 in the trilogy, which was my favourite overall.
* Some classic sci-fi misogyny through this series though, heads up.
* Really interesting to see the author's Chinese cultural influences come through in his writing, which to me was quite distinct from the way  a Western/Eurocentric perspective might have approached some of these ideas.

**Magical Realism (hard mode)**

*Weyward* by Emilia Hart

* Pretty good. Three women of one family tree, navigating witchcraft in three different centuries (17th century, 20th century, 21st century). Natural magic connection was cool, I enjoy the trend of getting into the mucky bits of nature with mud and bugs, and I appreciated the overall themes of the novel (especially identity and inner strength)
* Usually I like multi-gen / multi POV writing, but for a book so centred on the characters I wish I felt like I knew them more by the end  of the book. Instead I felt as though each woman had a couple of Defining Characteristic post-it notes in my mind. I wanted more emotional connection that just didn't happen for me.

**Young Adult (hard mode)**

*Threads That Bind* by Kika Hatzopoulou

* Really cool concept, a retelling of Greek myth in a world where the children of gods inherit their powers. The worldbuilding is great, hinted at a post-climate-catastrophe world, implications of different powers (stigmas, refugee status, registration). A little clunky at points though.
* The story of the sisters' relationship really wrenched at my heart strings (pun intended, iykyk)
* For whatever reason this didn't have super staying power with me though (hence the lower rating). I'll be reading the sequel though

**Mundane Jobs**

*Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries* by Heather Fawcett

* This was such a sweet, whimsical read balanced against the fae being old-school dark, fickle tricksters. I really appreciated how much this felt drawn from true folklore, rather than kids books understanding of fairies (or the fae from some new adult books too!)
* I love Emily, a reclusive academic, (I relate *hard* to Emily) and Wendell is the most 'man written by a woman' I've ever seen. He fluffs a pillow and it magically brightens the room, my heart!

**Published in the 00s (hard mode)**

*The Discworld Graphic Novels: The Colour of Magic and the Light Fantastic* by Terry Pratchett, Steven Ross, and Scott Rockwell

* The Pratchett humour is there, the art fits perfectly, the stories are wonderfully absurd
* This is only really readable if you've read the books already, otherwise too much context has been stripped away and it gets really hard to follow

**Angels and Demons**

*House of Earth and Blood* by Sarah J Maas

* Everything I expect from a SJM book: every character blindingly beautiful and stunningly accomplished, a will-they-won't-they (they will) romance, and lots of combat (tense despite the plot armour)
* I loved the mystery element to the plot, all of the detective work and unravelling the clues... So fun!
* A couple of moments that just hit me in the heart and got me ugly-crying.
* Also had descriptions of what everyone was wearing, all the time, which got real old, real quick.
* This felt like a really strong opening to the trilogy and I felt really excited for where she was taking the series (spoiler: in my opinion, downhill from here)

**Five SFF Short Stories (from Uncanny Magazine, issue 20)**

*She Still Loves the Dragon* by Elizabeth Bear

* An allegorical tale about a knight and a dragon, in love and being burned.
* Compelling writing, from both POVs. Many parallels for being hurt in love threaded through that are really touching.

*Contingency Plans for the Apocalypse* by SB Divya

* A short sci-fi narrative about trying to escape what's presumed to be a US state where things have become *real* dystopian. A doctor condemned for providing abortions, and the ripple effects on her loved ones. Very tense, very sad.

*The Hydraulic Emperor* by Arkady Martine

* A story of desire and sacrifice playing out at an alien auction. I enjoyed this, I connected with the history and the characters in a very time.

*Lines of Growth, Lines of Passage* by Marissa Lingen

* A relatively simple premise (a sorcerer trapped by her apprentice in a cherry tree) explored for the effect on her psyche once she escapes. A nice twist on the classic vengeance story.

*Your Slaughterhouse, Your Killing Floor* by Sunny Moraine

* This feels... visceral. I can appreciate it objectively - but not for me.

**Horror (hard mode)**

*Annihilation* by Jeff VanderMeer

* I watched the movie first, and this was pretty much what I expected.  Spooky surrealism, everything's uncertain, trust no-one, the ecology's weird af, what's that in the bushes over there?

**Self-Published (hard mode)**

*Witches of the Dead Kingdom* by Ash Oldfield

* Interesting YA-ish exploration of Welsh mythology and modern Melbourne, Australia (with witches)
* Folklore was neat! I loved the grouchy little house kobold that's straight out of folktales
* I'm a sucker for ""this forest is so old and magic"", even better with a forest guardian as in this book
* I wished the relationships had been fleshed out more, I am planning on reading the sequel to see what happens there

**Set in the Middle-East**

*The Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi* by SA Chakraborty

* Loooooooved
   * The humour
   * The historical info
   * The self-aware descent into an adventure worthy of legend
   * Indiana Jones vibes with a Mum heart
   * The subtle threads of queer-friendly gender roles, expectations, & transition
   * The ""evil monster"" that's just an animal, actually
   * The yearning (should I be a sailor now?)

**Published in 2023**

*A Day of Fallen Night* by Samantha Shannon

* I love women :')
* I adore sweeping epic fantasy and this is exactly that with a feminist, queernorm bent and lush descriptions and world-building.
* Also bonding to mythical creatures? The dragons and ichneumons? Yes please and thank you

**Multiverse and Alternative Realities**

*Piranesi* by Susanna Clarke

* Very fever dream, very mysterious
* I did not want to put this book down, I just read in as few sittings as I could so I could just get swept away with it.
* The ending was interesting, a bit of a tone shift and a bit more... coherent? than I would have liked, but still one of my favourite reads

**POC Author (hard mode)**

*Enclave* by Claire G Coleman

* Incredible premise - a future where there are privatised communities  (""enclaves"") where the owner can essentially model society according to  their values. If you're born there... Well, that's all you know.
* The ending felt a little rushed, a bit neat and tidy, I would have loved this book to be longer and to really explore a full-scale revolution, but in general I think it did really well to extrapolate and  critique societal issues (some feeling *very* close to modern day) the way sci-fi should.
* Well worth a read, from an First Nations author (Claire G Coleman, a Noongar woman from western Australia)

**Bookclub or Readalong Book**

*The Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K Le Guin

* My first foray into Le Guin's sci-fi. I'm still a fantasy girlie, but thought this was amazing. Loved the cultural touches in the worldbuilding and slow, gentle, reflective pace especially in Estraven and Ai's relationship.
* A fair chunk of this would have gone over my head, it's the sort of book that I know I'll take more from on a re-read.

**Novella**

*Thornhedge* by T Kingfisher

* With everything I've heard about T Kingfisher, I expected to like this more. Perhaps it was the wrong book to start with? I liked it, it was an interesting subversion of Sleeping Beauty and folklore expectations, but it didn't grab me.
* Nice, short, easy read though. I had a very pleasant afternoon reading this by a river until some ants came at me mandibles first (or perhaps it was stinger first, I can't say I checked).

**Mythical Beasts (hard mode)**

*Godkiller* by Hannah Kaner

* A world where gods are real, and you can earn a (hard-won) living by killing them.
* The ""godkiller"" had ""witcher"" vibes, in a good way
* I loved this world, a good old-fashioned adventurer's world with river-side inns and lantern-lit markets and campfire-baked bread. Right up my alley
* The mythical creature is Skedi, a god of white lies in the form of a hare with deer antlers (though not named as a jackalope). He's bound to a orphaned noble girl. A Very Interesting character.

**Elemental Magic (hard mode)**

*Her Majesty's Royal Coven* by Juno Dawson

* Amaaazing
* More gender, more sapphic love, more explorations of womanhood and friendship that the author just *nails,* plus some anti-racism and intersectionality for good measure.
* The elemental connection in this felt really organic, with one scene in particular standing out where each woman is connected to the others, experiencing their essence as a form of 'their' element that was beautiful
* The magic, conflict, plot, themes in this were all so complementary of each other but I just can't get past the depth of the characters and relationships in such a relatively short book. I smashed this in about a day.

**Myths and Retellings (hard mode)**

*She Who Became the Sun* by Shelley Parker-Chan

* A retelling of the ascent of the Hongwu Emperor, who rose from poverty to begin the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century.
* This is *almost* historical fiction. Magical elements are just a visible Mandate of Heaven and ghosts.
* More gender! In this and the sequel. Really organically woven through the historical tapestry of this book.
* Heads up, this book is dark and the sequel is darker. This is in the  context of me being a wuss though, it's probably nothing for all you grimdark readers out there.

**Queernorm Setting (hard mode)**

*Legends and Lattes* by Travis Baldree

* Similar to T Kingfisher - I'd heard the hype, I wanted to love it, but it just didn't click for me. It was fine, a pleasant read, but the sheer niceness felt shoehorned in at some points and I had a hard time staying immersed.

**Coastal or Island Setting**

*Harvesting the Storm: A fable from the shores of West Papua* by John Waromi

* A fable told from the point of view of tidal sea creatures: Andevavait the blenny fish, Bohurai the toadfish and Anggereai the striped crab. They're the unnoticed observers of the local Ambai tribe on the shore, who come into the story on the periphery, as side characters.
* A really reflective and insightful narrative, with lots of local cultural and historical knowledge that was well worth the read.

**Druids (hard mode)**

*The Jasmine Throne* by Tasha Suri

* I feel like you guys know me by now. Sapphic romance, yes, lush settings and description, yes, culturally deep world-building, yes, women supporting women, yes.
* The druidic magic of this world is dark and unnerving, which is an interesting lens for what's often written as ""good"" magic.
* *The Oleander Sword* (#2 in the trilogy) was also incredible, I cannot wait for #3 later this year

**Featuring Robots**

*In the Lives of Puppets* by TJ Klune

* A story of one human living amongst three robots (later four), whose world gets turned upside down in about 6 different ways. General questing ensues as 'the kids' go to save 'dad' in a world that's darker than they'd ever thought.
* A surprising standout to me was the description of their home. I think that'll stay with me for a long long time.
* This got a mixed reception among his fans, from what I've heard. Honestly, if you like his other books, I think the key factor to enjoying this book is if you grew up with crass sex jokes and the kind of teenage humour that hits you over the head with a hammer. Crude. If you've got a soft spot for that, and otherwise appreciate cosy fantasy, this is the book for you. I'm not sure what that venn diagram looks like.
* This book has heart. I'm trying to keep this post fairly spoiler-free, but the ending to this is an exploration of memory and trauma and loving people even when their minds might be different, and it had me sobbing.

**Sequel (hard mode)**

*The Golden Enclaves* by Naomi Novik

* I loved this, I thought it was such a good extension of everything that El and her friends had been piecing together over *A Deadly Education* and *The Last Graduate*. Naomi went *big* with the plot and I'm glad she did, even if I'm still not totally sold on some of the relationships that evolved over the series.",Fantasy
1711707612.0,I played 2023's Bingo Blind.," Hi everyone! I discovered the r/Fantasy Bingo contest with about 5 days left in this years contest, so I thought I’d just see how I did with reading blind, and leaving a short review for each of the books I did.  Link for a video version: [https://youtu.be/cRBwTQusOdM](https://youtu.be/cRBwTQusOdM)

First off I think the contest is brilliant, what a great way to get people to read more and different books! I am going to plan a full TBR for next years contest for sure!

As I didn’t plan ahead I have no hope of a blackout, so just thought I’d give myself 1 point for normal mode and 2 points for hard mode to see how I did 😊 The no repeat Author rule got me pretty bad, I read a lot of

I think Messiah is a title, so **Dune Messiah by Frank Herbert**, I read the first 4 Dune books this month, and of all of them Messiah was my favourite. I love how it recolours the events of the original. I loved seeing the events after the climax of the first book.

**Superheroes**

I didn’t even consider the idea that there would be super hero novels, now that I know they exist I have already looked in the recommendation thread for something to add to my TBR.

I did however read over 1000 pages of **Green Lantern** **by Geoff Johns** in 2023 so I’m going to count that for the square 😊

I have read the first half of Geoff Johns run on Green Lantern, including the Lantern Corp series. Geoff John made me care about a super hero that I had previously found really dull. Unlike a lot of other comic series’ I’ve read, Johns manages to make the entire run feel like a continues narrative.

**Bottom of the TBR**

I have been meaning to read **Neuromancer by William Gibson** since I was in Highschool. My best friend in high school kept telling me to read it, but being the contrarian I always was I just never did. I am so glad I got around to reading it this year, there’s a reason its called a masterpiece. I have read a lot of complaints from people not liking that it drops your right into the story without really building the scene/world. For my money though I adore stories that just jump right into it and make you catch up. It really is a pillar stone of the cyberpunk genre, and if you liked Cyberpunk 2077 at all you really should check it out

**Young Adult**

In early 2023 I went on a binge reading like 16 **Animorph** books by **K.A. Applegate**. For this square I’ll put down **The Stranger**, just because it has a cool bear on the cover. While they very clearly are YA books they are a lot darker than I thought they would be. While they don’t ever get really violent, they do leave it to your imagination to picture it. For example, at one stage an alien shoots a weapon and it hits a concrete pillar, it then describes how the plasma/acid eats away at the concrete, bubbling and melting, and how the rebar burns within the concrete pillar. Then it just says something like “Next the alien shot the old man at the bus stop hitting him square in the back” right afterwards, it doesn’t describe what happens to the man but its pretty clear.

At the heart it’s a story of a found family fighting a guerilla war without being able to trust anyone outside their group, anyone they know might be an alien looking to kill them.

**Mundane Jobs**

Great square, for this one I went with **High Rise by JG Ballard.** Set in a luxury high rise, High Rise tells a story of Class struggle and warfare. It is one of the tensest books I’ve read, and I did not really enjoy it at all when I first read it in mid 2023. 

However a few months later I was still thinking about it, so did something I almost never do and re-read a book the same year I read it the first time, and on the re-read I found the book amazing, I couldn’t get enough, this time through the theme really hit me in the face.

**Published in the 00’s** 

The hard mode of this one is that it can’t be in the top 30 of r/Fantasy’s Best of 2023 list. I was both happy that I was going to get 2 points, and sad that **Revelation Space by Alastair Reynolds** wasn’t higher on that list!

I actually DNF’d this one twice a few years ago, I think it was just a bit long and slow a the start, but this time through I was hooked. I love the technology on display, any book that plays into the lack of light speed communications across a galactic scale has me super interested. I loved the Ultras in this book, for example in this book a crew of ultra’s is trying to track down a man, they get the information that he is on a certain planet, but this news is 20 years old when they receive it, then its another 20 years old by the time they get to the planet, acting on 40 year old information, stuff like that gets me excited.

I challenged myself this year to read and review 10 fantasy books, as I am usually a horror/sci-fi reader. The first book I chose was **Between Two Fires by Christopher Buehlman** which was phenomenal. The blend of horror and fantasy was great. The world building and prose left everything feeling, cold, wet, damp and hopeless. I am super excited to read more Buehlman now

**Five SFF Short Stories**

The hard mode of this is read a short story collection, almost a free space for me, I usually read 3-4 short story collections in a year. I love the format of short stories for Horror and Sci Fi especially, I often find that without the need to flesh out the world, introduce too many characters etc authors can get right to the point with the big fun ideas that make me love those genres.

This year I read a few but for this square I’ll use **Berserker** **by Fred Saberhagen** the first book in Saberhagen Berserker War series, the short stories show a few different viewpoints on the extermination of all living things that the titular Berserkers are attempting to accomplish. Build millennia ago by a race only known as the “builders” the Berserkers are giant robotic battle engines, intent on killing all life. I would bet good money that the Reapers from Mass Effect are at least somewhat inspired by these books.

**Horror**

Horror is my JAM! I have a lot I could use here, but to best avoid the no repeating Authors rule I am going with **Family Business by Jonathan Sims**. Jonathan Sims is the author and voice behind the amazing Magnus Archives podcast, which if you like episodic horror is a must listen!

Family Business follows a woman as she joins a Father and his two daughters in a Crime scene/biological clean up company. Going from job to job we learn more about the woman’s past as well as a dark secret at the core of the family. A very enjoyable read.

**Self Published or Indie Published**

I went with **There is no Antimemetic Division by Qntm** which if you know of the SCP Wiki, is a series of stories based in that universe, strung together to create a single narrative. Dealing with entities that disappear from your memory as soon as you stop looking at them, and others that exist only within the information about them, the stories detail the daunting task of trying to catalogue these entities and protect humanity from them. Some of the best twists and surprises I’ve read in this one.

Puzzle House however disappointed me, I found the logic behind a lot of the puzzles to be flawed and not very interesting. The characters fell flat for me, and the ending was not very enjoyable to me.

The book I was reading when I discovered the bingo contest! **Zone One by Colson Whitehead**. I haven’t read any zombie stuff since World War Z a few years ago. Having now finished the book I can say that this is the most well written zombie story I’ve read. The prose, while absolutely gorgeous, did grate on me by the end of the book however, as I described it to a friend of mine “Why use one simile when you could use five!?”. It really did paint wonderful pictures in my mind, but it just kept going and going and felt overlong. The moments of action however were amazing.

Next year I will definitely take part in some readalongs, the entire reason I started a YouTube channel was to try to do read alongs with people, as none of my friends read as much as I do. However as I didn’t even find this subreddit until a few days ago I’ll just grab a normal point with **Prince of Thorns by Marc Lawence**. Which I found really disappointing. Every video I watched before this video complained about how evil and unlikable the MC of this one was. But I just hated him because he seemed like an edgy teenager, he thinks so many terrible things but almost never acts on them. 

Also if your book has Murder and much worse in it, then just use the F word. Seeing characters say Feck pulled me right out of the book.

I love Novellas, as with short stories, without needing to be the length of a novel a lot of Horror and Science Fiction really shines. In this case however with **Two Minutes with the Devil by Matt Micheli** it didn’t shine for me at all. There was some fun 80’s nostalgia but the writing felt very flat to me, the ending felt super rushed, while the opening felt super slow and drawn out. The book left me feeling pretty disappointed. However, published by D&T Publishing so hard mode points!

While this book in the series only has small amounts of it, the rest of the books and the universe they’re set in is very Queernorm. I went with **Use of Weapons by Iain M.

Banks’ writing always feels fresh and fun to me, I love all his books so far, and this one is very high on the list.

Okay, I am probably cheating, but the hard mode is seafaring! And **Sphere by Michael Chrichton** takes place under the sea! They get there on boats and submarines, there’s coral and sea life. I’m being stubborn and counting it, mostly because I want to talk about Sphere.

I was so into this book, right up until the last few chapters, until then I found it tense and super interesting, always guessing at what was going on, but in the final chapters I felt like a lot of the rules that got put in place earlier in the book about the supernatural element got broken, and then the characters with supernatural powers used them so unimaginatively. I think Michael Chrichton wrote a power that was too powerful and couldn’t fit it into a satisfying ending.

**Sequel**

In march I read the first 3 books in the Bobiverse, culminating in **All These Worlds by Dennis E. Taylor**. It is almost like someone dug  into my brain and took down dot points on all the things that would make me love a sci fi book, then kicked me in the shins by making the books comedy featuring one of the most annoying characters I’ve read. The premise of someone copying your brain, memories personalities into a machine to use you for their own purposes because you no longer have any rights should be a capitalist hellscape nightmare, in the vein of Qntm’s amazing Lena (which if you haven’t read [https://qntm.org/mmacevedo](https://qntm.org/mmacevedo)) but in this book the MC is quipping about Star Wars and Star Trek within a few minutes.

The events in this book were enough to get me through the entire series, but I can’t help but think of what this series could be if it was written as a hard sci fi, it would probably be a 15/10 for me. But, different strokes for different folks!

**Queernorm Setting:  The Order of the Pure Moon Reflected in the Water by Zen Cho**

A very funny, light hearted tale about war, greed and those punished for practicing their non-political religions. No, really. Guet Imm, a young votary of the Order of the Pale Moon joins up with a bandit group including Tet Sang and gets involved in the protection of a sacred relic of her order. Along the way secrets of the past are revealed about both characters. It’s honestly astonishing at how fun this story was, considering how terrible the wartime atrocities and general misery of the common people are. But people do their best to survive and make sure the important things survive regardless.

**Coastal or Island Setting: Seasparrow by Kristin Cashore**

Cashore loves to explore trauma responses. In her Gracelings series it is now Hava’s turn to process her terrible childhood in which her very existence was a secret as she had to hide from her evil father King Leck, who had the power to make people believe his lies. Hava, being a graceling gifted with disguising herself, managed to physically keep herself safe and alive but watching her mother’s murder and hiding in plain sight from the psychopathic torturer King Leck has left mental scars on her. It doesn’t help that in this book she, with her half sister Queen Bitterblue, gets shipwrecked and has to trek across a frozen landscape to find safety again. While Bitterblue tries to decide what she is going to do with the powerful chemistry equations that bring weapons of mass destruction into the world acquired in the last book, Hava is trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life now she is dissatisfied with her lot. The book is in three parts, on the ship, after the shipwreck and after they arrive home and need to adjust to not being starving, exhausted and lost. I love Cashore’s Gracelings series and do recommend the book but this isn’t the best entry point, although it can be read solo. To get a proper sense of an unfolding world I do recommend starting with Graceling or Fire, both of which can be read as the first book, and it is probably best to read Winterkeep at least before this one.

**Druids: Milo and One Dead Angry Druid by Mary Arrigan**

I am a cheapskate who didn’t want to spend money on this square. My choices were this book for 7-10 year olds, a Terry Brooks or a book my mother had which consisted of 400 pages of two young men consistently failing to learn. I thought this the least worst and honestly, it wasn’t bad. Yes, the plot was a bit trite and predictable, but Arrigan had good sense of character and voice. Milo as a protagonist is a loveable prankster and fiercely loyal to his friend. It was very steeped in modern Ireland as well, which was interesting for an Australian. Not going to read it again, but recommended to children. 

&#x200B;

**Robots:  Artificial Condition by Martha Wells**

The second on the Murderbot series, in which Martha Wells continues to ask the important question about fully sentient and sapient AI which somehow nobody else thought to ask: If we had robots and AIs with free will, how would they react to entertainment media? Set directly after the first book in which the Murderbot decides to leave its guardian to explore freedom and their newfound individuality without outside interference, the Murderbot meets a university research intelligence transport ship to introduce to TV serials. With it’s help the Murderbot investigates the incident which caused them to hack their governor module and acquire free will in the first place; the mine site where they murdered several humans under orders. In his investigations to discover if their governor module was compromised forcing them to kill or if they did it themselves they get caught up with more corporate espionage and murder by taking on a security contract of some very young and desperate researchers. It’s a touching story of a being trying its first wobbling steps at making their own decisions with plenty of hilarious moments to balance the poignant ones.

**Sequel: Reticence by Gail Carriger**

The fourth in the Spotted Custard series, which is in itself a sequel to the Soulless series about the protagonist's parents. We get introduced to the character of Arsenic the doctor as Percy’s love interest, who herself is the child of protagonists in a series I have not read. Fans of this series as well as those of steampunk, romance and comedy of manners will enjoy this book as it has all the trademarks you have come to expect from Carriger’s Soulless world. As this time the crew is off to Japan to discover more scientific reasons for the supernatural and natural world interacting. The main characters are the courting couple Percy Tunsall and Arsenic. Arsenic as newcomer provides a good audience surrogate for new readers, it isn’t the worst entry point but I do recommend all the earlier books as Carriger is just a delight. ",Fantasy

3. Man hating ones. Like I understand men r usually the problem in our lives but just don't make them this comically evil that I takes me out. Like why is every single guy a creep??!! Why is the love interest the only one forgiven when he's the worst???
4. The tiddies. These are even worse, usually found in book written by men. Like oh God please give her character/goals/personality that doesn't revolve around some guy. Like they make me question of these women are even humans.
5. Whole personality revolving around how hards it's being a women. Like ik this to my molecular level but I don't wanna read this like it's fantasy why misogyny nd patriarchy still the damn rule??

6.Women character either gotta be misunderstood saint or so comically evil to not have a single humanistic gene in her. Like it can't be that hard for a female character to be a tyrant nd still love her children?!

7. The ""independent"" One.

8. The ""pick me"" I can't stress enough how much I can't stand internal misogyny in books from female characters.

So now that I've ranted enough, can someone please recommend me a book with well rounded female characters?

The last good female characters that I loved were in the 'cradle' series esp Malice (please if there are any other characters like her do recommend!!), Princess Donut from 'dangeon crawler carl', 'Yumi' from Sanderson, Phédre from 'Kusheil's dart', that one assassin from 'Kings of Wyld'.

I'm open for any genre, except Y/A, and the female characters don't have to be main characters either, i'm open for them being supportive, antagonist, side, background any just as long as they're not the above mentioned. Even better if they are above the age of 23.

I've read most of those usually recommended books here tho and the female characters I hated the most are from that Kingkiller Chronology (>!like why every single gal wanted to bang that loser I still wonder!<), Shallan from 'way of kings'. I won't start on Y/a. I couldn't stand literally any so now I've stopped even checking them.

1711688827.0,Series with Complex Factions and Intrigue,"I really like political fantasy, or at least fantasy that has political elements.  The most interesting is when they have complex factions, meaning factions that have multiple stakeholders.  These stakeholders are often, but not necessarily, united in a single main objective, but they usually have separate aims that can drive tension. 

The classic example of this is ASOIAF.  Sometimes the whole region is the faction, like the North, but the houses then betray each other.  Or each House itself is a faction, with either openly warring members (Baratheon) or family members with objectives that run counter to the other (Lannister).

I think Wheel of Time is like this too, with each nation having its leaders/noble houses scheming or warring. 

Are there other series like these that explore those kinds of faction politics in depth?",Fantasy
1711688026.0,S/o Robin Hobb for creating a magic system that also functions as a metaphor for consent and boundaries in relationships,"By that I mean the Skill and the Wit. It took me multiple rereads and only a few years ago for it to dawn on me. The Skill, it’s repeated over and over again, is an exercise in trust because of its profound intimacy. Being inside another persons mind is as about as intimate as you can get and when it’s violated via skill commands and especially when it comes to rifling through their innermost thoughts and memories. 

I’ve said this before elsewhere, but it would probably feel *as* violating as someone shoving their hands down your pants or their tongue in your mouth, there’s a reason Fitz develops such strong walls after his >!training with Galen!< that no one, sometimes not even himself can get through to them.

The parallels between that and other forms of violation, and the boundaries we make both internally and with others, to handle and process the violence are obvious. 

Equally, if not more so are the ones for the Wit. In retrospect I can’t believe I missed it. The repeated emphasis on finding the *right* Wit partner, not just forcing your mind onto another animal. Making sure you were both equals in the relationship, that neither the human nor the animal was too young or too old, making sure appropriate boundaries were maintained and one partner didn’t subsume the other. 

It’s all there but written so expertly that what could come off as a clunky, ham-fisted attempt at social commentary comes out as subtle elegant analogy that’s there if you look for it. Contrast this with someone like Goodkind shoehorning his bdsm objectivist shit into the Sword of Truth series ",Fantasy

1711681500.0,So Let Them Burn by Kamilah Cole let me down,"So Let Them Burn by Kamilah Cole is a Jamaican-inspired YA fantasy about dragons, magic, and sisters. The story takes place five years after the end of a decades-long war in which the people on the island of San Irie overthrew their colonizers in the Langlish Empire. If you find it weird that the author couldn’t think of a better name for the English stand-ins than “the Langlish,” then you are not alone.

Our sisters are 17-year old Faron and 18-year old Elara. Faron has the unique ability to call upon the power of the Iryan gods to perform magic, and she is the reason the Iryans won the war five years ago. At a peace summit with the Langlish, Elara becomes magically bonded to a Langlish dragon and must go to Langley to learn to be a dragon rider. Faron vows to get her sister back and break the bond between Elara and the dragon, which is thought to be impossible.

**Review**

I was intrigued by the premise of this book but ultimately let down by poor execution. So much of the story feels like it was built around a checklist of set pieces. Have a dragon race against ~~Draco Malfoy~~ a bully, check. Have a night market scene, check. Have a ball, check. There’s a lot of infodumping, weakly developed romantic relationships, worldbuilding and plot inconsistencies, and baffling character decisions that made me almost DNF many times.

Here’s the biggest let down, for me: according to the book cover, Faron will “set the world on fire” to bring Elara back. I thought that meant her sister would be kidnapped and she’d be wrecking shit the whole book to get her back.  In reality, Faron just kinda thinks really hard for two months and whines a lot.

**Romance**

We have two enemies-to-lovers relationships for both sisters. Neither are believable. ~~Asami Sato~~ Signey Soto has almost no personality, and Elara simply has a lot of ‘gay panic’ moments when interacting with her where she can’t stop thinking about how pretty Signey is but chiding herself for thinking the enemy is attractive. If you like dragons and sapphic relationships, then you’re better off reading The Priory of the Orange Tree.

Reeve Warwick has more personality, and in fact I found his character quite compelling. Faron’s distrust of Reeve is far too quickly thrown aside after she overhears Reeve with his father at the peace summit. There’s just not enough time spent establishing that Faron doesn’t trust Reeve for me to care when she suddenly does trust him. When Reeve called out Faron for being childish and self-centered in the library, I was cheering him on. Imagine my displeasure when Reeve is apologizing to Faron for it later on. 

**Dialogue**

The main characters are teenagers, but they often act like middle schoolers and sometimes talk like thirtysomethings in therapy. For example, here’s Reeve explaining why he shouldn’t have gone to the market in Port Sol: “This is a safe place for this community, and I invaded it, no matter my intentions.” It would have given him more of a character arc and given Faron something to actually dislike him for if he started out being irritated that the Iryans don’t all accept him with open arms.

**Word Choice**

The descriptions of people are overwritten and include describing skin as “old glue,” “black milk tea,” and “leather-colored.” There are also word choices that don’t make much sense in this world, like a dorm in a fortress being “apartment-style” or the sisters giving each other a “quick recap.” 

**Missing Pivotal Scenes**

It’s very confusing to keep track of who knows what. Faron is keeping a big secret from Elara and Reeve, and she’s very worried about what will happen when they find out. A few chapters later Elara and Reeve somehow know the secret and aren’t even mad at Faron for keeping the truth from them. There’s no build-up of Faron deciding to tell them the secret, no indication that Faron told them at all, and no fall-out from her secret keeping. Why even have her keep the secret? Probably because the first line of the book tells you that Faron is a liar, and for some reason we’re sticking with that despite Faron not really doing much lying at all.

**Worldbuilding and Plot Inconsistencies**

If I wrote down all the things that happened that made no sense, I would be writing for hours and you’d have checked out by now. Let me list the most egregious.

* I’m supposed to believe a 12 and 13 year old won a decades-long war in less than a year. They show barely any signs of trauma, unless you count Faron being incredibly self-centered and annoying.
* Faron’s ability to call upon the gods is explained as Faron’s prayers being the first prayers the gods heard, but the war has been going on for decades. Obviously other people have been praying to the gods. It would make more sense if it was some Avatar-like cycle where you’re born with the power and only one person at a time can have that power.
* Bag juice. This might seem trivial, but it really pulled me out of the story. In the first few pages, Faron buys bag juice from a street vendor. Bag juice is a traditional Jamaican cold drink sold in a plastic pouch. Faron bites off a corner of the bag to drink it. The thing is, the people in this world get around by horse-drawn carriage and use gas-powered lighting. You’re telling me they also have street vendors selling cold drinks wrapped in disposable plastic bags? Where’s the plastic coming from? It feels like the author wanted to include a nostalgic treat from her childhood without considering the worldbuilding implications.
* Elara escapes from Deadegg in the middle of the night and makes it to Highfort, apparently on foot, by late afternoon. So… she walked for 12 hours through the mountains and never once implied that she was exhausted. She signs up for the military when she gets to Highfort. The very next day, she and her squad who signed up YESTERDAY are in the capital on riot control. Given the map, they would have traveled through the mountains again to get to the capital. The military must be very hard up for recruits. So she hasn’t slept for two days and she’s traveled for a really long time and has no thoughts about that at all! Also, somehow, Elara runs right into Reeve when her squad enters the capital, which presumably is a very large city. How lucky!
* >!Why did Faron have to start her lessons with Gael by trying to connect to the life force of dragons across the sea? It would have been more interesting if he’d told her to start connecting with the life force of the living things around her. She could have had an ethical dilemma about that until she’s forced to use it to save Reeve’s life. !<
* >!Near the end, Faron senses a dragon flying towards San Irie. Somehow, Queen Aveline has already sent a drake to her to take her to the dragon. How did Aveline have enough time to do that? How did they even know there was a dragon coming? No idea. The drake flies Faron to Deadegg, and in the drake she calms down the dragon and makes it turn back. How did the drake pilot know to fly to Deadegg? Again, no idea. How did all this happen before the dragon ever made it to Deadegg? No idea.!<
* >!Queen Aveline says the people are calling for war over the unprovoked dragon attack by Zephyra. Why is her solution to personally travel across the sea to the seat of the Langlish Empire, where she can easily be kidnapped or killed? !<
* >!There’s absolutely not enough in the story to support the nest’s decision to turn traitors to Langley and escort Elara back to San Irie. Maybe it makes sense for the husbands to do that, because she did save their lives, but even so, why would they preemptively agree to come back to Langley for punishment?!<
* >!Queen Aveline was not shown to be a powerful magic user until the very end of the story, when suddenly she is apparently rocket-powered and flies around soloing a mythical dragon.!<

**Trivial but still baffling things**

* Regular summoning also seems like a bad gig for the ancestors. You’re telling me I’ve died, but instead of eternal rest I get to be an iPhone for teenagers? No thank you. 
* Queen Aveline lets angry protestors on the royal airfield for… transparency?
* >!Why did Faron release Lightbringer in the town square with all the villagers and children there? Is she stupid?!<
* >!Why does the villain have four names at the end of the story? Why introduce the name Iya at all?!<

**In Summary**

There’s more I could say about this book, but it probably already looks like I have an axe to grind with this author. This is her debut effort, and I am also not a teenager so I am not the intended audience for this book. Maybe it will resonate with some teenagers, especially those connected to Jamaica. In fact, I hope it does! However, I will be avoiding the sequel to this book. ",Fantasy

**Title With a Title:** The Watchmaker of Filigree Street by Natasha Pulley **4 stars**

I've been wanting to read this book since 2016 when I read a review for it by Tamora Pierce, but never got around to it. Last year I read The Kingdoms by Natasha Pulley for bingo. I used this years bingo to finally read The Watchmaker of Filigree Street, and it was just as good as The Kingdoms. The best parts of a Natasha Pulley book are the twists and turns of the plot and this one delivered some great ones. While I didn't understand the appeal of Nathaniel, I loved the relationship between Nathaniel and Mori. My favorite character by far though was the clockwork octopus. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good LGBTQ+ book and a well written twisty fantasy. Also counts as Mundane Job (EM)

**Superheroes:** Nimona by ND Stevenson **4 stars**

Another book, or in this case graphic novel, that I knew about but had never read was Nimona by ND Stevenson. My reason though was more petty than Watchmaker, and it was because I didn't like how She-Ra ended (I just don't see how Catra and Adora are a healthy couple). I admit though I was wrong not to have read this graphic novel sooner. Nimona is a pure chaos sidekick and I love her. The graphic novel does a good job of balancing fun shape shifting, villainous plots, while also being a commentary on power corruption and discrimination. I would recommend this graphic novel if you like anti-heroes and comic books. Also counts as Young Adult (EM), Queernorm Setting (EM)

**Bottom of the TBR:** Inheritance by Christopher Paolin **3 stars**

This is the ultimate bottom of the TBR book for me. I bought Inheritance when it first came out 12 years ago, but as I hadn't really liked the third book, I never got around to finishing the series. Inheritance has been sitting on my book shelf since then, watching me, judging me... Well, now that I've finished it, I can finally say, wow, what a not-good series. When I decided to read this book for this square I had to do a bit of research to refresh my memory on the earlier books. I came across this reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/2bscok/comment/cj8fke0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) about how Eragon is just Star Wars with dragons, and now I'll never be able to look at Eragon again without thinking it's plagiarized. Back then, I was reading all the big fantasy books. I remember thinking, when I was reading the second and third books in the Inheritance Cycle, that Eragon's brother reminded me a lot of Perrin from Wheel of Time. Looking back, I wasn't wrong was I? This last book, Inheritance, was just not good. It has >!one of the longest wars in a single book that I've ever read, Eragon gets high for some reason, a woman falls in love with one of her torturers, and Eragon leaves the known world on a ship that could have been written by JRR Tolkein himself, because you know, it was.!<However, Christopher Paolin didn't give up and finished his series, so that's worth three stars. I would not recommend this series though. There are better dragon rider books out there. In fact one of them might be reviewed in this very post. Also counts as Young Adult (EM), Mythical Beasts (EM)

**Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy:** Sourdough by Robin Sloan **4 stars**

I admit I'm not a big magical realism fan but I had fun with Sourdough. This book takes place in San Francisco. It's about a woman working in the tech industry who gets a very \*special\* sourdough starter and learns that there is more to life than just work. It's a very light book with fun characters, and it really made me want to eat a sourdough bread bowl with soup while I was reading it. I would  recommend this book if you like cozy food books and magical realism. Also counts as Mundane Job (EM)

**Young Adult:** The Eidolon by K.D. Edwards **5 stars**

An entire book about Quinn and Max and Anna!!!! I am a huge fan of The Tarot Sequence lol. Quinn is one of my favorite characters and I loved getting to see how his prophecy powers worked. As a main character Max was great, and his character was more flushed out. I also liked learning more about Anna and her point of view. This book takes place during the events of the third book of the Tarot Sequence, The Hourglass Throne by K.D. Edwards, but is the start of its own series, Magnus Academy. As it deals with younger characters it is more of a YA book and I loved every second of it. I will be rereading this one a lot as I wait for the next Tarot Sequence book which won't be coming out until 2026. I would recommend this book if you liked the Tarot Sequence, and if you haven't read The Tarot Sequence I would highly recommend it. Also counts as Published in 2023 (EM), Queernorm Setting (HM)

**Mundane Jobs:** The Truth by Terry Pratchett **5 stars**

I'm reading Terry Pratchett for the first time. Somehow Discworld never came up while I was reading all the big fantasy series. Not sure how that happened. Anyways, I really liked this one. The story is about the first newspaper in Ankh-Morpork. It's a fun satire on the fourth estate, there's some good plot twists, and it was really well written. Can't wait to read the rest of Discworld! Also counts as Published in the 00s (EM)

**Published in the 00s:** The Curse of Chalion by Lois McMaster Bujold **4 stars**

There weren't many books from the 2000's that I hadn't already read, and that I wanted to read. I heard about this book after reading a different book for this square and decided to pick between the two. I ended up going with this one because I really enjoyed it. It was like reading an old school fantasy book again with warriors, royalty, court intrigue, and a bit of darkness. The main character is returning from a war and becomes the secretary to a young noble woman. There are plot twists you kind of see coming but the plot doesn't suffer from it. Overall a good read. I would recommend this book to fans of T. Kingfisher's The World of the White Rat series. Also counts as Mundane Jobs (HM), Angels and Demons? (EM)

**Angels and Demons:** When the Angels Left the Old Country by Sacha Lamb **4 stars**

This was one of those books that hit a bunch of boxes for me. LGBTQ+ rep, Good Omen vibes, and Jewish mythology. An Ashkenazi angel and a demon leave their shtetl and accompany a young girl to America. It addresses immigration, assimilation, identity, love, good and evil, and religious freedom. The angel was my favorite character and I was invested the most in the their journey. I would recommend this book if you like cozy fantasy, LGBTQ+ rep, and Good Omen vibes. Also counts as Young Adult (HM), Coastal or Island Setting (HM)

**Five Short Stories:** The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories by Ken Liu **4.5 stars**

This was a very last minute read, as I found out the editor of the first anthology I read wrote some not great things on social media. I generally don't like short stories unless they're related to a book series I've enjoyed like Tamora Pierce's Tortall and Other Lands: A Collection of Tales and Tortall: A Spy's Guide. I tried a few different anthologies and finally landed on this one. It was really good. Asian mythology and Asian history mixed with fantasy and sci-fi. I would recommend this book if you like good sci-fi and short stories. Also counts as Mundane Jobs (EM), POC Author (EM) (HM), Mythical Beasts (HM)

**Horror:** What Moves the Dead by T. Kingfisher **4 stars**

I am a horror coward. I can read violence (ok maybe not graphic violence but that's a personal preference), but put in a scary clown or zombies and I'm out. This book was recommended for people like me, so I read it. It's a retelling of The Fall of the House of Usher by Edgar Allan Poe. I have not read that story so I'll add that What Moves the Dead is also a lot like the show, The Last of Us. The book was scary, I did not like it, T. Kingfisher is amazing, it gets 4 stars for writing, and I never want to read horror again. Please don't make me. Moving on. I would recommend this book if you like light horror and The Last of Us. Also counts as Myths and Retellings (HM)

**Self-Published OR Indie Publisher:** The Lonely Castle in the Mirror by Mizuki Tsujimura **4 stars**

I read this book from the indie publisher Erewhon Books who did an AMA with reddit. This square was soooo hard. I started and stopped 6 books before finally making it through this one. I probably know every indie publisher's catalogue that did an AMA with r/Fantasy, and have learned that Goodreads is not my friend when it comes to finding a self-published book that I actually like with 100 reviews or less. This book was translated from Japanese and addresses bullying in Japanese schools. The main character is invited to a mirror world with six other children after she no longer feels safe going to school after a severe bullying incident. This book started out slowly and didn't really pick up until the middle. The entire ending was great though and easily my favorite part of the book. I would recommend this book if you like Japanese culture, Japanese light novels and anime, and breakfast club vibes. Also counts as Young Adult (HM), Multiverse and Alternate Realities (EM), POC Author (EM)

**Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF:** The Bruising of Qilwa by Naseem Jamnia **4 stars**

Another challenging square for me to do in hard mode. I read a few books but couldn't get into them. Then I learned that The Bruising of Qilwa, a novella I'd read in May, counted for this square. I was more than happy to be able to get to use it. This book is set in a Persian inspired world. It is about a magical healer helping with a pandemic in the country their family have immigrated to. This novella is also about refugees, assimilation, and prejudice. It also features a nonbinary protagonist. I liked the magic system, the characters, the happy sad feel of the writing, and found family. I would recommend this book if you like Middle Eastern inspired books, LGBTQ+ rep, unique magic systems, and mysteries. Also counts as Novella (HM), Elemental Magic (HM), Mundane Jobs (HM), Indie (HM), POC Author (EM), Queernorm Setting (HM)

**Published in 2023:** To Shape a Dragon's Breath by Moniquill Blackgoose **4 stars**

I am so happy I found this book last year! I've learned to be very careful when it comes to indigenous representation and always check the AICL before I read a book with indigenous characters. My one disclaimer is that this book was NOT reviewed by the AICL, so if there is any misrepresentation I am unaware of it. This book features by far the best dragon rider I read this year. Anequs is a young Masquapaug girl who finds the first dragon egg that her island has seen for generations. When the baby dragon hatches she bonds with them. Unfortunately, much of the Masquapaug dragon lore has been lost and Anegus needs to learn how to take care of her dragon. Anegus ends up going to a school run by the Anglish colonizers of the mainland to learn how to be an Anglish dragon rider. This book deals with themes of colonization and racism. I was actually surprised to learn that this was a YA novel because it didn't feel like one while I was reading it. It also has LGBTQ+ representation. I would recommend this book if you like dragons and The Hands of the Emperor by Victoria Goddard. Also counts as Young Adult (HM), POC Author (EM), Mythical Beasts (EM), Coastal or Island Setting (EM)

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities:** The Spear Cuts Through Water by Simon Jimenez **5 stars**

There's not much I can say about this book that hasn't already been said. It's excellent. The Spear Cuts Through Water is the story of two warriors on a dangerous quest. It's a little too cruel and violent for my taste, but gorgeous poetry, and so well written that I can't give it any less than 5 stars. I overall recommend this book. Also counts as POC Author (EM), Mythical Beasts (HM)

**POC Author:** Infomocracy by Malka Ann Older **4 stars**

This was a strange sci-fi novel about democracy, the power of information, and the dangers of globalization. This book takes place from multiple POVs during a big global election where people can die based on the information they possess. I didn't dislike it, but I also didn't like it. It just wasn't for me. The writing and the the plot are good, and honestly if you can accomplish that, I'm going to give you four stars no matter what. I would recommend this book if you like sci-fi and politics. Also counts as Mundane Jobs (EM)

**Book Club OR Readalong Book:** Ink Blood Sister Scribe by Emma Törzs **3 stars**

This book taught me to pay more attention to book club, so I don't end up reading a book that is not to my taste. Ink Blood Sister Scribe is a story of two sisters and a library that is out to get them. It was an ok read. This book kinda reminded me of older CLAMP manga (especially that ONE scene). Overall though, I didn't really like it and felt it could have been better written. I might recommend this book if you like dark academia and YA. Also counts as Mundane Jobs (EM), Published in 2023 (HM)

**Novella:** To be Taught, If Fortunate by Becky Chambers **4 stars**

Bingo this year had me reading more sci-fi then I've ever read in my life. I liked this book, but it blurred together with 5 other sci-fi plots I read last year. Sci-fi really isn't my genre, so they all tend to blend together for me. This book is about an astronaut named Ariadne who is on a space mission set in the future, to boldly go- to learn more about other worlds and study their unique ecosystems. I liked learning more about Ariadne's earth as the book went on. As always Becky Chambers writing is excellent. I would recommend this book to Star Trek and Becky Chamber fans. Also counts as Featuring Robots (EM)

**Mythical Beasts:** Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Fairies by Heather Fawcett **5 stars**

I fell so hard for this book. It's perfect, no notes. Emily Wilde is a Cambridge professor studying the fair folk on a small Scandinavian-inspired island. She is a no nonsense scholar who just wants to be left alone with her dog to do her work, and write her encyclopedia. Emily's peace is shattered when she is joined by her \*annoying\*, lazy, charming, handsome, fellow colleague, and self-proclaimed friend, Wendell Bambleby. This is a fun book with witty dialogue, accurate descriptions of the fair folk, and great writing. I would recommend this book to anybody who likes Howl's Moving Castle. Also counts as Published in 2023 (EM), Multiverse and Alternate Realities (HM)

**Elemental Magic:** The House Witch by Delemhach **4 stars**

There aren't a lot of books featuring an elemental magic system that I haven't already read, and this was one of them. I've loved elemental magic ever since I read The Circle of Magic by Tamora Pierce, my favorite series of all time. This book is about a kitchen witch who is the head cook for the royal palace. It's a really long read and honestly not much happens. I enjoyed it for what it was though and the writing was good. I'll probably not finish the rest of the series but I'd recommend this book if you like cozy fantasy series. Also counts as Title with a Title (HM), Mundane Jobs (HM)

**Myths and Retellings:** A Day of Fallen Night by Samantha Shannon **5 stars**

I love The Priory of the Orange Tree. It's probably one of my favorite books, and while I'd do anything for a sequel, I will 100% take a prequel. I did a bit of a reread before I started this one, as a lot of the events and characters in A Day of Fallen Night are mentioned in the The Priory of the Orange Tree. A Day of Fallen Night takes place many years before the events of the first book. We are introduced to three new main characters: Tunuva, Glorian, and Dumai, as well as side characters like Wulf, Esbar, and Lady Kuposa. This book has also dragons, LGBTQ+ representation, battles, court intrigue, great cultures, and world building. I would recommend this book to fans of the Tamora Pierce's Tortall series and epic fantasy. Also counts as Published in 2023 (EM), Mythical Beasts (EM), Coastal or Island Setting (EM), possibly Druids (HM).

**Queernorm Setting:** Dark Moon, Shallow Sea by David R. Slayton **4 stars**

2023 had some great surprise hits and this was one of them. I really liked David R. Slayton's Adam Binder series, but this book was more fantasy than urban fantasy, so it was more my speed. This book is about Raef, the last priest of the moon goddess. The moon goddess and her entire order, except for Raef, was killed in a raid by the knights of the order of the sun god. It's just a beautifully written book with lovable characters, a good plot, and I want MORE! I have questions that need answers! Hopefully this is the start of a new series. I would recommend this book to fans of David R. Slayton, Megan Whalen Turner, and T. Kingfisher. Also counts as Published in 2023 (EM)

**Coastal or Island Setting:** The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by Shannon Chakraborty **4 stars**

Yes I know, me and everybody's cousin are probably going to be using this book for this square. I've been a fan of Shannon Chakraborty ever since I read The City of Brass when it first came out, so I was excited to learn she was writing a new series. This is a book about pirates and found family, but mostly it's a fun adventure set on the high seas. What I like about this book is it's inspired by and features medieval Islamic pirates instead of Caribbean pirates. I also like that the book features an older female protagonist. I would recommend this book if you like pirates, and The Princees Bride vibes. Also counts as Published in 2023 (EM), Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF (EM), and Mythical Beasts (HM)

**Druid:** The Children of Gods and Fighting Men by Shauna Lawless **4 stars**

Everybody's favorite... the druid square. Nothing much to say about this one. I read it because I needed a book featuring druids. Also, I figured if I had to read a book about druids I might as well make it historical. This book takes place in 10th century Ireland and is about two woman, a Viking queen and a druid healer. It was very well researched, and for that I give it 4 stars. I would recommend this book if you like historical fiction disguised as fantasy and Vikings. Also counts as Coastal or Island Setting (EM).

**Features Robots:** Network Effect by Martha Wells **4 stars**

This square gave me a chance to read The Murderbot Diaries that everybody has been raving about. I probably wouldn't have read them otherwise. Again, I'm not a big sci-fi reader. I thought they were fun, and now after reading them, I'm a little confused why Alexander Skarsgård was cast to play Murderbot, but that's another conversation. Murderbot is a security robot that just wants to be left alone to watch soap operas. However, much to Murderbot's annoyance, their humans keep getting into trouble causing Murderbot to have to \*sigh\*, KILL a bunch of people and robots. Well written and short, I would recommend these books to anyone looking for a fun sci-fi read. Also counts as Queernorm Setting (EM) and Sequel (HM)

**Sequel:** The Last Command by Timothy Zahn **5** **stars**

A friend of mine and I happened to be watching Star Wars Rebels at the same time before Ahsoka live action show came out. They were watching it for the first time while I was doing a rewatch. I mentioned that I thought Thawn was a ""meh"" character. My friend said they couldn't disagree more and told me about this famous Star Wars series, The Thrawn Triology. I did not go into this series with high expectations but boy did it end up blowing me away! Why did we get the prequel movies when we could have had these books as sequels?! Thrawn is so much better in these books, and is actually a really good bad guy. This is a great series featuring Luke, Han Solo, and Leia and takes place right after Return of the Jedi. This series also confirms for me that David Tennant would have made a great Thrawn, and that I need to see Brie Larson as Mara Jade RIGHT NOW. I would recommend this series to any Star Wars fan. Seriously, if you're a fan of the original Star Wars films, and haven't read this series, I can't recommend them enough! Also counts as Featuring Robots (EM)",Fantasy
1711674739.0,I just finished Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell and...,"Susanna Clarke did not disappoint. Piranesi was amazing and this was, while not as good in my opinion, it was quite outstanding as well.

The magic in this book is the best magic I've read in any fantasy book. It's wondrous and whimsical, yet eerie and terrifying all the same.

The characters are great, I loved childermass, strange, hated norrell but in a good way. I really liked Stephen, the military guy thar strange worked with, I forgot his name. I like Arabella, and the man with the twistledown hair was an amazing villain. Not clear as to what his motivations to do anything were tho.. was he only playing and having fun?

I love the themes of obsession, power and the beauty of everything that surrounds us that Susanna tackles both here and in Piranesi.

I also loved the footnotes, they made the world; the history, and everything feel so alive.

My only complain is, the book could've been shorter and it mightve benefited from that, but who knows. It was a great read regardless, Susanna Clarke needs to write more because her prose is outstanding and she is just such a good writer",Fantasy
1711670873.0,What’s a book you loved but had a really hard time actually getting through?,"I’m reading Babel right now and I love it. I love the concept, I love the magic system, I love the use of language, and I love the character development. You may not agree with me, but you know what it feels like when you love a book.

Usually I get through a long fantasy novel in a week. Maybe 2 for some of the thousand pagers. For some reason, I’ve been reading Babel for 3 weeks and am still not done. But every time I pick it up, I still love it! Yet only seem to get through a short amount.

I’m not sure the reason, but I’m curious if anybody else has had that experience with a fantasy (or other) book? Or maybe they know why I’m having this experience!",Fantasy
1711663669.0,"Do you enjoy ""formulaic"" books?","Didn't know how to put it into better words in the title. I am currently reading book six of the Dresden Files and getting slightly annoyed that it's ALWAYS the exact same thing.

- There's always two different cases going on at the same time

- Harry is always under time pressure

- Harry always gets wounded pretty early on and has to fight wounded and tired for most of the book

- He always has the great epiphany how everything connects in the last 5th or so of the book

- He always gets captured but of course escapes and defeats the bad guy

- He always gets tricked by some women because he is the biggest idiot and simp 

- He always talks about how magicians are so versatile and strong when they can prepare, then fails to prepare for the most basic things, gets surprised by some vanilla thug and rarely is more creative than throwing fire at everything

- There's always sexy, naked women involved and I'm getting really tired of reading about Dresdens sexual desires ( the bondage sex scene in book 5 was so cringe I had to skip the whole thing)


Usually I only have that problem when binging long running shows where the formula becomes annoyingly obvious after 2-3 seasons ( Dr House or Supernatural are super guilty of that), but that's the first time I really notice in a book series.

1711668884.0,"2023 Bingo #2 - Hard Mode, With Reviews","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s6xdogkxr5rc1.jpg?width=791&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f488c9b8cd62d783dbc66e68c763963bed2375c

And here is my second bingo of the year! All reviews below. My favorites of this card are, without question, The Spear Cuts Through Water and The Fifth Season. Black Leopard, Red Wolf is up there as well. I had a lot of fun planning out two cards, so I plan to do this again!

**Title with a Title (HM: No royalty)**

*The Jade Setter of Janloon by Fonda Lee* – 5/5. It was clever to look at the clan rivalry, as well as some of the main series central characters, from the perspective of a somewhat neutral party. I did feel like that was something that had been missing from the series proper. Short but effective. 

**New to You (HM: Never heard of author) - Substitute Square**

*The Art of Prophecy by Wesley Chu* – 4/5. Though Chu has been publishing for a while, he hadn’t crossed my radar. I was in a bookstore, and was intrigued by the cover and the mention of wuxia on the back, so I picked it up. It’s a really fun and humorous book. A boy is prophesied to kill the Khan and save his people, except he's bratty and actually not well-trained, and then the Khan dies in Chapter 3. The execution of this set-up is fantastic. The characters are engaging, and their dialogue is crafty. The book does a good job of laying out the wuxia genre for an unfamiliar audience, but with some cool trope inversions. There are four POVs with distinctive voices, though I decidedly liked one of them much less than the others, and three are women leading the field in their respective combat style! Much appreciated. But there were some things that could've been better. The plot started out REALLY strong and then just dragged in the middle. There was some plot element repetition. For the humor being such a strong element, the book didn't tug on my other emotions, no matter how many characters were killed off. (And I think there needed to be more line editing. There were more typos than a book not on its first print should have, and there were moments when the prose was repetitive or clunky.) 

**Bottom of TBR**

*Land of the Lustrous, Vol. 1 by Haruko Ichikawa* – 4/5. Like I mentioned in my other bingo, manga doesn’t work for me as a medium. But I liked the art style, especially the Buddhist imagery, and the introduction to the world is interesting and unique.

**Magical Realism (HM: Not in top 30)**

*The Beautiful Ones by Silvia Moreno-Garcia* – 2/5. I think sadly this author is not for me. This was the second book of hers I’ve tried. In this one, the social season of ""European"" elite is not a setting I particularly care for, and it's not made much more interesting by the fantasy element introduced. And for a book with little plot and full character focus, I didn't care for the characters. Valerie was (rightfully, but this doesn't make it any more pleasant) bitter and lashes out at everyone; Hector was manipulative and then wish-washy; and Nina was naive and fanciful and her being super into insects on top of her interest and talent in the \~lowly performance magic\~ was a little on the nose.

**Young Adult (HM: Published in last 5 years)**

*Divine Rivals by Rebecca Ross* – 5/5. This lived up to the hype. Sure, enemies/rivals is used in the absolute loosest of terms, but I thought the two main characters had a lot of chemistry. The letters aspect of it is, ahem, divine. And both Roman and Iris had great characterization to them. The plot had moments of real tension, and it was interesting (if not all too real) to see war in fiction from a correspondent's side. Though, it leans more heavily on the romance than the plot. I will say, the side characters fell flat, and the worldbuilding leaves behind a lot of questions, but at least for the latter I'm hopeful that book 2 will answer them. (Sidenote – I did not like the sequel as much!)

**Mundane Jobs (HM: Not set on Earth)**

*Record of a Spaceborn Few by Becky Chambers* – 3/5. The POV jobs here include a caretaker (like a funeral director), archivist, spaceparts scavenger, and an engineer working in a warehouse that stores and sorts parts for the base. I’ve read the whole series, and this was the weakest for me. This book digs deep into the society of the Exodans, the humans who left our solar system and travelled across the universe in a fleet of spaceships. Thematically, it's framed around grief, as well as the balance between preserving tradition and exploring the new. Each character finds themselves at a different point along that balance, which is nice. But the story was a bit meandering, and there were many POVS whose stories don’t even fully interact by the end. I was also just not as attached to the characters or intrigued by the plot. Lastly, there was just one aspect of the Exodan worldbuilding that kind of...annoyed me? It's that their economic system relies on bartering. There were some explanations about it, but nothing convincing. These are large, tens-of-thousands of people living in a spaceship, across dozens of spaceships, societies, and many people have jobs (sorting technology, clean-up, etc.) that don't produce anything they can barter with. This is not a recipe for a society that can function without a currency.

**Published in the 00s (HM: Not in top 30 of all time)**

*Vita Nostra by Marina & Sergey Dyachenko* – 5/5. Bizarrely imaginative. The authors created this unsettling and mysterious atmosphere effectively, and nearly immediately, and without laying it on too thick. And structurally, it's quite unique. I never really knew where it was heading or what it was building towards. The characters are quite strong, especially the professors/advisors, each a different, scary version of the tough love stereotype. And yet I still like them! Sure, they threaten people's families in not so many words but they are very convincing in wanting only the best for their dear students! And of course, also Sasha, whose transformation is profound, and reflected in the writing style. Yet, despite all the weirdness, the book has this grim humor to it that made me laugh a lot. It was well-balanced, tonally, for sure.

**Angels & Demons (HM: Protag is angel or demon)**

*Guardian: Zhen Hun, Vol. 1 by priest* – 4/5. My reread of this bingo, though barely; I read a fan translation of such poor quality I was practically skimming, and I was also pulling an all-nighter to fix my pandemic sleeping schedule so I was delulu. Sort of a spoiler that the second POV is a demon (in a more Chinese mythological sense) but it’s made pretty obvious even in this volume. It's not my favorite priest novel, but it is pretty fun and I'm enjoying it more than I did the first time around. The introduction of mythological elements into a contemporary world is quite interesting, and the characters and dynamic of the Special Investigations Department is fun, though Shen Wei isn't my favorite love interest.

**Five SFF Short Stories (HM: Anthology or collection)**

*Hexarchate Stories by Yoon Ha Lee* – 5/5. It's a testament to Machineries of Empire that I immediately got my hands on the corresponding short story collection upon completion. Usually, it takes me like a year to do so, if at all. I enjoyed all of it. The flash fiction, which sometimes featured new writing styles, the author's notes, which are witty and insightful, and all of the Jedao. I think my favorite Jedao vignette was the one through his brother's POV. The ending novella wrapped up a couple loose ends from Revenant Gun and featured high-quality action and some jaw-dropping moments. It also makes stark the characterization differences between Jedao One and Jedao Two, a true testament to Yoon Ha Lee's skill.

**Horror (HM: Not King or Lovecraft)**

*Lapvona by Ottessa Moshfegh* – 5/5. I picked this up based on a raving Reddit review that described it as a wholly bizarre but unputdownable read. I wasn’t prepared for just how grotesque and grim it was, and yet, I have to agree. From the outset, the writing is highly skilled, evocative and without a word out of place. The novel itself is an exploration of the many psyches in this small town ridden with disaster and trauma, mostly of the typical medieval sort, somewhat of a stranger fantastical bent. While few of the characters are likeable, the approach is really compelling. In particular, a lot of attention is given to the characters’ different interpretations of faith, in the face of all the suffering around them. It isn’t a book I’d recommend lightly, seeing as reactions are mixed, but it successfully evoked that weird gross dark medieval fantasy atmosphere that until now I’d enjoyed primarily in video game settings.

**Self-Published or Indie Publisher (HM: Publisher did AMA)**

*Lonely Castle in the Mirror by Mizuki Tsujimura* – 3/5. While I liked how everything came together in the ending, and it's certainly a cathartic read for anyone who's ever felt lonely starting in a new school, the writing is over-narrated to the point of repetition and mundanity. It reads quickly, but just not particularly well. The characters were fine. It achieves its goal of depicting mental health issues in young students, and it's interesting to see how this manifests differently in different parts of the world - with this one being a deep dive into futoko.

**Set in the Middle East (HM: Author is Middle Eastern heritage)**

*We Hunt the Flame by Hafsah Faizal* – 3/5. Didn't 100% vibe with the characters and the plot, especially how slow it was in the beginning. It took like 100 pages for everyone to say their goodbyes and the quest to start. But I am weak for tortured princes like Nasir, so it got points for that. I didn't think the romance would do it, but it got there for me. It reads quickly so once the plot got moving, I wanted to know what happened next.

**Published in 2023 (HM: Debut)**

*She Is a Haunting by Trang Thanh Tran* – 3/5. It was an ambitious book, trying to do a lot with themes ranging from family and forgiveness and diaspora, to the legacy of colonialism, to sexuality, all wrapped up in a horror novel about a haunted house and hungry ghosts. The family themes came across pretty well, but I think the book overall was undercut by trying to do so much as well as overwritten prose. The haunting plot is convoluted, and not in the way where untangling it is satisfying. While I liked the family dynamics and the historical aspect/message of the haunted house, there wasn't a lot of tension - sort of central to horror.

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities (HM: Don't walk through literal door)**

*The Spear Cuts Through Water by Simon Jimenez* – 5/5. Rarely do I read something and think of it as a piece of art, something beyond literature. This is some of the most masterful storytelling I've read. No word or phrase feels out of place. It's literary writing in a most beautiful form. (I can't believe this didn't get a Hugo nomination?!)  


It starts off slow, with a framing device that drops in and out of the main story. It's told in second person, which did take getting used to, but I do understand its purpose. This is the part of the story that speaks most to us; the non-fantasy of mundane life and oral storytelling and family sagas. I felt least invested in these parts, the Theater included, but I LOVED how it tied into the main story at the end.

As for the main story, there's just so much to say. It's very fantastical, reading a bit like folklore, but with violence dialed to the max. The way the stories of the Moon and Water gods and of the kingdom and the Emperors and his sons unfolded was delightful worldbuilding. The main timeline is slow-paced, taking place over just five days, but it involves a large cast of complex characters and depictions of unrest and rebellion. The most captivating were that of the Three Sons, who are wicked but not quite in a cartoonish way, and the Empress, who is selfish and flawed and regretful and somehow this all makes sense in light of her godhood. And for Jun and Keema, the main characters, I loved them as well. Jun especially, whose self-torment was done so well. Keema's backstory isn't as interesting, but I don't have any complaints about his characterization. And I ADORED the romance (and what a slowburn it was!). I'm a huge sucker for these high-stakes romances. I've said it before and I'll say it again - it's only peak romance if the characters face off against death in multiple instances and can only steal tender moments between violence and gore and despair!

And somehow the most emotional moments for me were reserved for the Defect tortoise. I was very attached to him. The scene at the Thousands rivers and the callbacks to it later on are some of the most beautiful, bittersweet moments I've read. Bravo.

**POC Author (HM: Futuristic sci-fi)**

Rosewater by Tade Thompson – 3.5/5. An interesting idea, and it was fun to uncover the complex reality of the aliens in both timelines. The characters had a lot of personality, and I liked a lot of the side characters. The middle chunk of the book had lots of action and revelations that it was hard to put down. The MC's narration is a bit dry, and he's certainly a jerk (and knows it), and it has the straight man quirk of him narrating every single woman's attractiveness even in situations where I'm like, surely the alien thing unfolding right now is more of an attention-grabber?!

**Book Club or Readalong (HM: Participate in book club)**

*After the Dragons by Cynthia Zhang* – 3/5. The dragons were really precious, and the romance was cute. There were some good themes here, about activism and chronic illness especially, interweaved with the environmental aspect of the dragons' plight. The way the dragons fit into our contemporary world was done in a way that made a lot of sense and was easy to go along with without some heavy worldbuilding. But this content couldn't be explored much in a novella format, and sometimes the writing was too direct and explanatory that it took me out of the story. 

**Novella (HM: Not Tor)**

*Spear by Nicola Griffith* – 5/5. I’ve been a fan of the Arthurian legend (in a superficial sense anyway) since Song of the Sparrow in 6th grade, and then Merlin in 8th grade and again in college. This book’s writing evokes that mythical, medieval quality, and its metaphors are very beautiful. It’s a style well suited for novellas. And of course, I love a genderbent retelling, and the story itself is well told.

**Mythical Beasts (HM: No dragons)**

*Black Leopard, Red Wolf by Marlon James* – 5/5. At surface level, this brought me back to when I first tried to pick up reading again but went straight for the super popular dark/grimdark series and thought maybe I wasn't as big a reader as I thought I would be. A world filled with terrible things, and chasing after prophesied children through cities upon worlds. But this grabbed my attention where those other series' failed. For one, the prose at sentence level is beautiful. I often wished I were reading this on Kindle just so I could highlight and return to those dozens of sentences that were so thought-provoking that it gave me pause. Secondly, the world is incredibly rich, and its description among the most vivid I've seen. 

And though almost all the characters (if not all?) do terrible things and are difficult to like at times, they're written so well, and I got attached to quite a few. Every character is a liar and has their own plan and ambitions, and it's hard to parse at times, but it makes the story within a story structure work. In fact, a lot of the plot is just figuring out what's real and what isn't over time. The majority of the book is a chase sequence - following a boy from city to city. The story uncovers who the boy is really, and why do people want him, and who are all the people pulling strings behind the scenes. I did get a bit burnt out in Dolingo and was ready for the next phase. But by the ending, everything fell into place, full circle, and it was a beautiful (if not emotionally difficult) ending.

**Elemental Magic (HM: Not Shades of Magic or Codex Alera)**

*The Fifth Season by N. K. Jemisin* – 5/5. What stunning story-telling! Each chapter just drips with tension. And God, I love a multi-POV/timeline convergence, and this was executed here perfectly. I'm in awe. The worldbuilding is unique and great - and I have so many questions left, especially about obelisks and stone-eaters and astronomy! that I just want to devour the sequels. The characters are done well, too, even if I think the cleverness of the plot and story structure is more memorable in the end. The dynamic between Damaya and Schaffa is so messed up that I get chills. And I loved the banter and also messed up but in a way that's out of their hands dynamic between Syen and Baster. (Side note - I finished the series, and while it overall is maturely written and clever, it didn't evenly capture my interest in books 2 and 3 and, I think, could have been cut down.)

**Myths and Retellings (HM: Not Greek or Roman)**

*In the Lives of Puppets by T. J. Klune* – 4/5. (Rumpelstiltskin retelling.) Klune knows how to write very charming characters. Nurse Ratched consistently had the most entertaining lines, and it was a relief to have a smart character that stops everyone else from making dumb decisions. Rambo was also very cute. The book's themes touch on love and choice, the main crew's found family and choosing to be brave and reckless to help each other juxtaposed against all the robots who have neither. The elements of family once again read stronger than the romance side-plot. It was a cute read, but ultimately a little bit slow and not quite as profoundly touching or humorous as The House in the Cerulean Sea.

**Queernorm Setting (HM: Not futuristic)**

*The Order of the Pure Moon Reflected in Water by Zen Cho* – 4/5. The cover and title are absolutely beautiful. The story is snappy, funny and well-written, a wuxia-esque snapshot of a quest of bandits plus a monk that tags along to sell religious relics. The setting hints at a more complicated world, emerging from a war that has transformed from an invasion to a Protectorate rooting out dissidents, including monastic orders. It was very thought-through, and I was hoping for a little more of that. The focus is more on the banter and the main cast of characters, which tends towards the humorous than any more profound emotions, to the point that the ending is a little silly.

**Coastal or Island Setting (HM: Features sea-faring)**

*The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by Shannon Chakraborty* – 5/5. When I was reading this, it struck me that it consistently felt like I was reading a really entertaining story where I was just happy to be along for the ride. Amina's character, and the set-up of her narrating her story to a scribe, is fun, the pirating and ship adventures are fun, her crew is cool, and her dynamic with her demon husband is fun. I was very pleased that the historical setting played a much larger role here than in Daevabad, especially since it's not a setting I've frequented in my fantasies (though I do know one thing, and it's that chilis did not exist in the Indian Ocean in this time period, sorry Shannon). The author knows how to sweep a reader into her storytelling. HOWEVER, the whole peri court plot point struck as a bit too similar to Daevabad, and I definitely connected more to the story when it was Amina going around with her crew and doing small heist things rather than separated, in some rather fantastical worlds.  

**Druids (HM: Not Druid Chronicles)**

*The Children of Gods and Fighting Men by Shauna Lawless –* 3.5/5. Let's start with the good - the cover and title are gorgeous. There's a lot of political intrigue - apparently written quite close to historical events, so I can pretend this is an intellectual exercise - and I never felt lost or confused, despite all the moving pieces. Also, while Gormflaith is not a particularly likeable character, I appreciated the choice to make her cruel and self-interested to a fault, and historically-accurate-ly sexist.

But, alas, the novel was missing oomph. In the beginning, SO much of the dialogue was written in a worldbuilding-infodump-y way to the point of being off-putting. Like, please just commit the ""crime"" of actual infodumping at this point, this dialogue is too unnatural. And ultimately, the plot lacked tension to keep me interested, and the characterization wasn't interesting enough to make up for it. Fodla especially was almost unbelievably naive. I'm unsure where I land on the interweaving of the fantasy elements. After reading the author's note at the end, I respect the choice, but it hasn't fully connected for me.

**Featuring Robots (HM: Protag is robot)**

*All Systems Red by Martha Wells* – 4/5. Fun and easy read carried by Murderbot’s humor and anxiousness around communicating with humans. Not sure I’ll pick up the rest of the series.

**Sequel (HM: Book 3 or more)**

*The Bone Shard War by Andrea Stewart* – 2/5. This series started out as a promising, genuinely good debut fantasy trilogy, with interesting worldbuilding, magic, plot reveals, and villains. The story then began to meander in the second and third installments. The character cast was not expanded, and the same arguments and plot devices were eventually beat into the ground. There was still a lot I liked: Lin is a compelling character; the romance between Lin and Jovis was nicely written; and there was still more to be uncovered about the world and its secrets. The more twisted or toxic relationships, like Ragan-Nisong or Jovis-Kaphra, were depicted well. But by this book, there was just nothing new. The same characters vying for power, the same motivations and end goals, the same sailing from island to island. The characters try to assassinate others, face assassination attempts, sneak into rooms to find things, and then the last quarter of the book has some interesting conflict. The writing and characters just weren’t strong enough to carry the tired plot, and the focus on Alanga magic over bone shard magic was a loss in my book, being much less interesting and novel. I found myself just rushing to see how it ends. I thought the conclusion was fitting, addressing the recurring theme of how an emperor is not truly fit to rule, though I still am unsure about Jovis's ending. I see how it can fit into his am-I-a-hero arc, but I'm not sure it felt necessary still.",Fantasy
1711666413.0,Books similar to Rangers Apprentice Series for Adults,"The Rangers Apprentice series was my introduction to Fantasy novels and truly my first love, and last year while deployed for 10 months I re-read them. While 20 years later the books were incredibly simple to read, the pace/story/message all resonated deeply with me. So I’m looking for books that are similar in the plot of the RA series but are written for adults.

- Master/Apprentice relationships
- subterfuge/rouge style combat and training
- saving the kingdom epic adventures. 

Also, I’ve read Dawn of Wonder by Renshaw which feels the closest. Thanks.

1711667465.0,Bingo 2024 - Double Trouble Card," This year, I decided to make Bingo overly complicated for myself, and do a card where EVERY book could count both for a 2023 square and a 2022 square. Why? Who knows. But I did it! Here were my caveats:

\- 1 sub square is ok

\- For 5 Short Stories, I could read an anthology to count for both years.

I did not plan this out in a meaningful way, as all my Bingo plans end up falling to the wayside anyway. But it was fun brain times trying to make it all fit together nicely!

Here are my Bingo books! Come for the reviews, stay for the occasionally funny hybrid square title.

**You AUGHT to Read More Books With Gay People** (LGBTQIA List and Published in the 00s)

Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey. I loved this book and am so glad I finally pushed through the first couple chapters. I knew on paper that it was definitely For Me, but had dropped it a few times in the past. I ended up reading the whole first trilogy in like a month haha.

**You Don't SEA That Everyday!** (Weird Ecology and Coastal Setting)

A Gathering of Shadows by VE Schwab. Another series I absolutely devoured! Lila got a little too ""Sassy rogue with knives!"" for me at times but I do think she had good character growth.

**2 Teens in a Trench Coat (2 or More Authors and YA)**

Skyward Flight by Brandon Sanderson and Janci Patterson. Sanderson is what got me back into fantasy, and while I am finding as time goes on I sometimes find his prose a little more straightforward than my preference, I really enjoyed Skyward as a whole. Spensa could be grating at times but I felt the twists were well done.

**Hey! Who Put Magic in My History Book?** (Historical SFF and Magical Realism)

Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus. This was maybe a stretch for Magical Realism, but I’ll count it because >!of the dog!<. This was a fast and easy read for me, but definitely should carry a TW for sexual assault. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it!

**We're Living in the Space Age** (Set in Space and Published in 2023)

The Scourge Between Stars by Ness Brown. This was spooky and I loved it. It was spooky in the way I prefer, which is via a slow build up of tension and dread - and also a shorter story.

**The Beast Stands Alone!** (Standalone and Mythical Beasts)

Starling House by Alix E. Harrow. I LOVED this book! I like everything Alix E. Harrow puts out for the most part, and I feel she gets better and better with each book. It was the perfect October read.

**We’re Rooting for That Guy Again?** (Anti-Hero and Sequel)

The Golden Enclaves by Naomi Novik. I was pretty satisfied with the way this turned out, and I loved the twist on >!the prophecy from El’s childhood.!<

**Book Clubella** (Book Club and Novella)

Ogres by Adrian Tchaiskovsky. This was fun!! I kind of foresaw the big twist but it was still entertaining.

**Blade of Bore** (Cool Weapon and Mundane Jobs)

Bookshops & Bonedust by Travis Baldree. I didn’t love this quite as much as Legends & Lattes but I still loved it! It made me want to move to the seaside and open a cozy bookstore.

**An Ice Cold Revolutionary** (Revolutions and Rebellions and Elemental Magic)

Memories of Ice by Steven Erikson. My big goal for 2024 is to finally finish Malazan (the change in audiobook narrator killed it for me) - such a complex and masterfully built series. Not for everyone, but it is for me.

**Nom d’Horror** (Name in the Title and Horror)

Snow, Glass, Apples by Neil Gaiman. Not usually a graphic novel gal but I really enjoyed this one. I do love an alternate telling of a fairy tale, and while I often find “gritty reboots” to be cringy, I think this was done well.

**I.M. Procrastinator** (Author Uses Initials and Bottom of the TBR)

The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. This has literally been on my Goodreads TBR since 2009, the actual bottom of my TBR. I enjoyed it, but I think I’ll enjoy it more when my daughter is old enough to read it with her.

**Sub and Pub** (Sub Square: Forest Setting (Published in 2022) and Self Pub - Forest Setting)

The Greencloak Wanderer by Jesse McMinn. I got this recommendation from this sub and I LOVED IT SO MUCH - Fern Gully x DnD vibes. I really really hope that Jesse McMinn publishes more books in the world. It felt adventurey in the same vein as Dragonlance for me somehow (even though there are many differences)...I just love a quest, you know?

**No, Really, I Didn't Read Good Omens For This One** (Urban Fantasy and Angels and Demons)

Small Miracles by Olivia Atwater. This was so sweet; I loved the idea of a fallen angel of petty temptations.

**I Bless the Myths Set in Africa** (Set in Africa and Myths and Retellings)

The Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi by Shannon Chakraborty. I think this book might have been made in a lab just for me. I loved the setting; the Islamic Golden Age is not a time period I see often explored in speculative fiction, and I loved going on adventures with Amina and her friends. It was also fun to see some East African representation in the characters; I’m an ESL teacher with many Somali students and it’s just not something I see a lot (if anyone has any good recommendations for East African fantasy, I’d love to hear it!)

**I Dub Thee, Non-Human Protagonist** (Non Human Protag and Title with a Title)

Reaper Man by Terry Pratchett. Love the Death books :) Long live Bill Door.

**These Are Kinda The Same Square?** (Wibbly Wobbly and Multiverse)

Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh. I know this book didn’t work for everyone, but it did work for me. It got me out of a serious reading slump, and also inspired a rare non-fiction read for me - it was inspired by the memoir Educated, so I read that afterwards and really enjoyed it as well (as much as one can enjoy a story like that I suppose).

**5 Short Stories**

Exhalation by Ted Chiang. I read this with my book club - highlights were The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling and The Great Silence. I hated The Lifecycle of Software Objects.

**I, Need A Therapist** (Features Mental Health and Robots)

System Collapse by Martha Wells. I feel like I don’t love Murderbot as much as everybody else - I like it quite a bit, but something just doesn’t quite hit for me - I love The Books of the Raksura, so I don’t mind a broody protagonist... I don’t know. I liked this book but the beginning didn’t quite work for me - I understand we are supposed to be left out of information Murderbot has and we don’t, but I think it could have been written more clearly.

**SPPOC** (Self Published and POC Author)

Blood Over Bright Haven by M.L. Wang. While I am devastated that there will be no more books in the Sword of Kaigen world (a book I loved but don’t think I could re-read now that I have a child), I did love this book and felt the twist was well done. Also, not enough dystopian books have the protagonist burn it all down at the end.

**This Book Was SUPER Good** (Award Finalist and Superheroes)

Hench by Natalie Zina Walschots. I didn’t quite complete 2 cards this year, but I did attempt - and the other superhero book I read was quite literally the worst thing I have ever forced myself through. This I really enjoyed however, and it felt like a fun twist on classic superhero stories (similar to The Boys, though not as dark by half)

**MEBIPOC** (BIPOC Author and Set in the Middle East).

Girl, Serpent, Thorn By Melissa Bashardoust. A lot of the story beats here were predictable but it was a fun read.

**2 Shapeshifters Walk Into a Book Club** (Shapeshifters and Book Club)

The Raven and the Reindeer by T. Kingfisher. I love T. Kingfisher and I loved this. The end.

**Love is Love - No Ifs, Ands, or Buts!** (No Ifs, Ands, or Buts and Queernorm setting)

Ocean’s Echo by Everina Maxwell. I loved Winter’s Orbit, and I loved this. Some people say it reads too much like the fanfic it originated from, but I’m okay with that.

**Urkel Was Druid Coded** (Family Matters and Druids)

Druids Call by E.K. Johnston. This was surprisingly good for an IP book - I am bummed that the DnD movie didn’t do better commercially, because I loved that as well.",Fantasy

I was inspired by /u/enoby666 (Thanks again!) to create a slideshow to post my books, so here I am with my Bingo wrap up. 

This took a lot longer than I was expecting because I made myself write some of my thoughts about each book. For 2024 Bingo I'm going to try to get each slide done as soon as I finish the book, so maybe it'll be easier next time. Fingers crossed.

Some of my stats:

I read 35 books, 2 novellas, and 6 short stories. (I'm a binge reader so I read complete series for any square where I chose a book that was part of a series.)

Total Authors: 31. This broke down to 15 male authors and 16 female authors, with 22 of them being new-to-me authors.

My favorites from this card were:

* The Bone Ships by R. J. Barker
* City of Stairs by Robert Jackson Bennett
* Murder at Spindle Manor by Morgan Stang
* Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik

My least enjoyed from this card were:

* Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro (felt like nothing happened and it was just sad)
* Armada by Ernest Cline (neat premise, but executed poorly)",Fantasy

In terms of tastes, I love Discworld, did not like Malazan, enjoyed Wheel of Time and barely noticed the ""slog"", got bored with Sanderson, apperciated the writing in Realm of The Elderlings, even though Robin Hobb rips my heart out every time, loved the characters in First Law, but always felt the endings were unsatisfying

1711655307.0,John Norman's Gor books: what was he trying to say/express?,"I feel like almost everyone who knows of the Chronicles of Counter-Earth know about it because of the strange subculture that's popped up around it: the kink stuff. But after reading the first book, *Tarnsman of Gor*, I was surprised that there's more to Norman's IP than just the smut.

But the whole world does feel a bit hollow, like a fabulous facade of a glittering palace that's completely bare on the inside. Norman spends so much time waxing about Gor's great cities and old religions and epic wars, but he doesn't go into depth on any of them.

In the first book the characters are mostly boring and one-dimensional, the plot feels aimless, and the ending isn't good. And I am told the books don't get any better. They just get more misogynistic, or at the very least more sexual.

I've been thinking a lot lately about the fine line between ""fiction with sexual themes"" and ""erotic fiction"". Certainly there is loads of excellent fiction that doesn't shy away from really hard topics like exploitation and power systems, but there is a point where you start wondering whether the author is writing this to make a point (as all good stories should) or for the gratification of themselves.

I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't be such a puritan. But I don't think I'll be reading any more of the Gor series.",Fantasy
1711646695.0,The Perfect Victim: How We Talk About Sexual Violence in Fantasy,"**Mar 29: Thanks so much for the amazing decision. I forgot this was a holiday weekend, so I've asked the mods to lock the thread. The discussion below has been outstanding, and I would like it to end on a high note without it needing to be monitored throughout a long weekend.**

There was a time when a solid quarter of my Reddit posts were explaining that sexual violence was not necessarily needed in everything, and that “how it was back then” doesn’t actually apply to made up worlds. I have argued that sexual violence is too often used as a shorthand for character development and worldbuilding. I have argued that readers should not be mocked or harassed for refusing to read books with sexual violence. I continue, to this day, to stand by my belief that we need books without sexual violence. I continue, to this day, to believe that books with sexual violence can, and should, be viewed with a critical eye.

However, it’s clear this second part also needs to be said: none of this means that sexual violence in books should not exist.

What’s more, I feel that we need to go further now with that statement: some of these books don’t just have the right to exist, but rather they *need* to exist.

I am increasingly concerned about how a (minor?) vocal section of readers have taken their personal reading preferences and have twisted the conversation into the very kinds of attacks that they themselves say they are protesting against.

In the age of parasocial relationships and the terminally online lifestyle, it seems to come as a shock to some that authors might not choose to display their experiences and traumas for the world to view. And, because they have not, I have seen readers attack victims of violence (even if they had no idea the writer experienced those things). I have seen an increasingly terrifying move to “victim checklist”. And for someone of my generation and experience, all I am seeing is just another form of “that’s not how rape victims act” and the ever-present cycle of the perfect victim.

This demand for the perfect victim, and why “ownvoices” authors should only be allowed to write these topics always, without fails, leads into that the author must disclose their trauma for the world. There is no longer room for the victim who refuses to be perfect, who is messy. They must only write stereotypical reactions and behaviours.

I think of an exchange here, a few months ago, that only be summarized as: *my* experience is the *only* perfect experience.

There is no room for mess.

And yet.

And *yet,* fantasy’s very nature offers the ability to create worlds where if can offer catharsis in the face of violence, and sometimes that is through brutally violent stories and characters. It can face it head on and drive an army through it.

It can offer the bleak reality that there is no fixing it, and that, even still, the heroine can emerge victorious while soaked in the blood of her enemies.

It can offer the hope that the darkness ends.

And while, it is true, that so many times these topics are not necessary to a story, many times they are. Because, for some, writing sexism or sexual violence or child abuse isn’t internalized misogyny. It isn’t because they have no imagination. It isn’t because they are writing for the male audiences’ expectations.

Because, sometimes, it is written to show the triumph over trauma.

We must show grace, and nuance, and compassion whenever we discuss this, for we do not know who is reading our words. We do not know who we are speaking of. And we do not know if, by speaking of that perfect victim, or that perfect reaction, that we might actually be saying, an author or a reader weren’t “perfect victims”.",Fantasy

I'm thinking about rereading them, but from reading some of the comments around here, it seems like they haven't aged well. I would likely pick up on the less pleasant aspects today (more-so than I would have a decade ago), so I'm not sure I would still enjoy them. Do the positive aspects of the series outweigh the negatives that it's worth rereading, or should I resign this series to my memories?",Fantasy
1711649691.0,"""There were two identical grey horses that played Artax.""","There were two identical grey horses that played Artax. They were trained for a long, long time by a professional horse handler with this almost impossible task for a horse to, without resistance, sink slowly down in the mud all the way up to their head. It did not go over their head. No horse would ever do that.

It took months to train them. In the film, you never see the horse's face go into the mud. Also, by having two horses, they would alternate which would be in the scene while the other relaxed.

So, the way they did that scene was that they had this little elevator under the water that slowly dropped the horse lower and lower. When it got to its chin area, they’d cut the scene. That one scene took over two and a half weeks.

It's really meant to be a sad scene; this was a crucial part of the film. People always tell me that when that scene comes on, they have to close their eyes. I tell them that I understand, it's very sad and difficult to watch but it was crucial for the story. It's all about being drawn into the darkness, and, unfortunately, the horse doesn't make it [in the movie].

They gave the young actor one of the horses and a saddle as a wrap gift. He ended up leaving the horse in Germany with his riding double. He had the horse for 20-something years. It had a great and wonderful life. They had a stable and a ranch in Germany.",Fantasy

1711645479.0,Sun eater series by Christopher Rupcchio - Underwhelming so far,"I saw this series getting rave reviews all over booktube and decided to give it a try.. I read empire of silence and howling dark and let’s just say I am not enjoying it so far .. that’s 2 big books without the payoff I was expecting based on the glowing reviews ..   I am not sure I will continue reading. My main issue with these two books is that they are missing the epic scope and sense of wonder that is the hallmark of truly standout SFF. We see only two worlds in the first book and another two to three worlds in the second book. And what I read about those worlds and the people in them was not interesting or weird enough. 
To make matters worse, I don’t care about any of the characters. In fact, Hadrian is not at all a likeable protagonist.. he comes across as too vain, melodramatic,  stubborn and hypocritical for my liking. Also I felt there are many filler chapters that could have been trimmed to improve the pacing.. the first 30% of empire of silence was excruciatingly slow. I think I will stop here and not continue with the series. Did anyone else feel the same way about this series ? 


Note : Christopher seems to be a really talented writer and I wish him all the success in the world. It’s just that I went in expecting some mind blowing epic space opera..  and so far it’s far from it..",Fantasy
1711645260.0,Another hard mode bingo card wrap up,"I finished my non-themed hard mode card!\* I decided to post these reviews in case anyone finds them helpful. I also decided to add sections reflecting on how well they fit the prompt and sometimes books/media that were somewhat similar (similar being really loosely defined, ymmv).

\*I actually finished a while ago, I just wanted to post my ace/aro themed card wrap up first.

**Title with a Title: The First Sister by Linden A. Lewis**

* Brief summary: A woman is in a religious order that forces her to be a sex worker and wants to get out, and a man searches for his soldier partner who might have betrayed him.
* Review: It was entertaining enough, but I think the themes could have been handled better. I disliked most of the twists, I feel like they either were not nuanced or made some of the representation in the story worse. Also, most of the decisions made by the people in charge in these books make no sense when you think about it.
* How well did it fit the prompt: It did, First Sister was a position in the religious hierarchy. Not much to say here.

**Superheroes: Dreadnought by April Daniels**

* Closeted trans girl gets to magically transition as a side effect of getting superpowers.
* I really liked the representation of being a trans girl in this one, and also the discussion of emotionally abusive parents and transphobia were really impactful. The superhero parts of the story were the least interesting parts for me, mostly because I’m not a superhero person.
* Similar books: If you want a more queernorm take on queer teenage superheroes, Sidekick Squad by C.B. Lee is a great option! Book 2 has a trans teenage boy main character.
* How well did it fit the prompt: It felt like a straightforward take on superheroes, which was actually pretty refreshing considering how many books I’ve read that try to subvert things and show that the heroes are really the bad guys.

**Bottom of TBR: Kindred by Octavia Butler**

* 1960s Black women gets time traveled back into 1815 slave plantation.
* This wasn’t a fun read, but it was a really important one. I really liked how it depicted how feeling entitled to other human beings can really twist a person and cause them to do abhorrent things, I’ve read other books that depicts slave owners as basically evil psychopaths (which some undoubtably were), but I feel like most probably were similar to the slave owners in this book. In other words, the real antagonist felt more like the entire institution of slavery than any particular individual without letting individuals off the hook. It also depicted how slavery tore apart families and communities, which I knew about but never had shown to me in such a visceral way before.
* Similar books: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Jacobs is a great supplemental read. It’s a first hand account of what it’s like to be an enslaved women, with a focus on how the author was constantly threatened with sexual assault by men in positions of power over her.
* How well did it fit the prompt: I didn’t keep an organized by date TBR, but I’ve definitely been meaning to read something by Octavia Butler since I’ve started reading more adult fiction. I kept procrastinating on starting it though, which it was good to overcome.

**Magical Realism: Lakelore by Anna-Marie McLemore**

* Two Latine, non-binary teens deal with being neurodivergant and start forming a friendship.
* I really liked this one. It definitely focused on some perspectives I don’t typically see focused on (ADHD and dyslexic, Latine, non-binary), and it was delightfully intersectional (like how one of one character’s methods of handling their ADHD tied into their culture). It definitely felt more contemporary than what I’m used to, which was surprisingly refreshing.
* Similar books: Cemetery Boys might work for a trans Latino story? I haven’t read that yet though. I’ve read The House of Rust as a different coming to age magical realism story, although it feels pretty different.
* How well did it fit the prompt: Oddly. I think most magical realism books have the magical part be known to the wider world and unquestioned, but this magical realism element (a magical lake) was a secret between the two main characters. It definitely felt magical realism like to me, pulling from a common source of the few other Latino magical realism stories I know of, mostly because the fantastical elements worked off of more dream/symbolic logic than the more or less internally consistent rules of more typical fantasy books.

**Young Adult; Siege of Rage and Ruin by Django Wexler**

* Two sisters with dangerous magic reunite after being separated and work on a rebellion in a city district under siege together.
* This felt pretty anti-climatic to me. Probably because >!I hated everything about the way the emperor and the councilor dude was handled. It felt very “we just need to get rid of this one evil person who isn’t even the emperor” instead of focusing on systematic injustices, and the ending felt a bit deus ex machina for me.!< The audiobook wasn’t very good, which didn’t help. I really liked the first book in the series, which is why I was so disappointed. The 2nd one was worse, and I was hoping this one would turn the trend around, but it didn’t. I was also annoyed about >!the love triangle set up for the younger sister, but at least it didn’t end up going anywhere.!<
* Similar books: Elemental Trilogy, The Beyonders, etc: There’s a lot of YA trilogies that nailed the landing for me much more than this one.
* How well did it fit the prompt: It’s definitely YA that wasn’t too romance focused, which was my goal for this one. I mostly chose it because this is a YA series that I started when I was a teen primarily reading YA, and I wanted to see how it ended.

**Mudane Jobs: The Redoubtable Pali Avramapul by Victoria Goddard**

* Political science professor who’s secretly a former adventurous rebel goes on a research mission and meets an old friend.
* It was cool to see some things in the Lays of the Hearth-Fire series fleshed out from a different character’s perspective. Also, getting a little bit more information about what happened in between different events in The Hands of the Emperor and At the Feet of the Sun was really fun. Goddard is still great at handling interpersonal relationships in a way I find compelling, but Pali was no Kip (she came across like a bit of a jerk, especially knowing how much she ended up hurting a different character) which did lower my engagement a little. Also, Pali not realizing >!she was studying her friend the entire time…I can’t tell if that’s better or worse than Kip not realizing his favorite musician is his Radiancy.!<
* How well did it fit the prompt: Well, political science professor isn’t a super normal job, but it exists in the real world, so I’m going to count it. It’s also at least tangentially related to parts of the plot, that counts, right? TBH, this square was giving me more trouble than I thought, so I decided not to overthink it.

**Published in the 00s: Perdido Street Station by China Miéville**

* Scientist gets lab specimens from sketchy sources and doesn’t take proper lab precautions. It doesn’t end well, predictably. With a bonus of being set in a weird city with lots of philosophical ramblings.
* This book was pretty slow and not super interesting for me. I’ve learned I don’t really like gross books, and this is definitely deliberately trying to be gross. I also am not a philosophy person, so I feel like I didn’t appreciate much of what Miéville was trying to do with that. His prose felt a bit obnoxious to me? Like it would have been more impressive that he used a bunch of uncommon words if he didn’t repeat so many (I swear undulate must have been used at least 15 times). The slake moths didn’t scare me, and I would have appreciated the creative world building more if I cared about literally any character. I can see why other people like it, it's just not for me.
* Similar books: New Crobizon is basically like Ankh Morpork in the City Watch Discworld books, but instead of humorous remarks on human nature you get gross weirdness and cynicism. It was also similar to The City and the City, the one other book by China Mieville that I’ve read but less focused on one issue and more weird.
* How well did it fit the prompt: It was published in the correct time frame. I kind of wanted to pick a book that wasn’t on the best of list at all, but I also wanted to read this because I’ve seen people hype it up and I wanted to see if I would like a more fantasy book by Miéville more than The City and the City. I did not, I don’t think China Miéville is for me.

**Angels/Demons: When the Angels Left the Old Country by Sacha Lamb**

* A Jewish angel and demon team up to find a lesbian that immigrated to America from a shtetl in Poland in about 1904.
* This was pretty enjoyable. I liked the representation of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage and how well that tied into the time period and also the angel/demon elements. There’s also some fun queerness. The pacing could be a bit weird at times.
* Similar books: Do I need to say it? Good Omens. I actually like this one a bit better though. The chavrusa dynamic between the characters was really cool. Being based off of Jewish stories instead of Christian ones felt more new and refreshing to me, and it also had more queer characters so it felt a bit less queer bait-y. I think some people liked the humor in Good Omens more than me or connected to those characters more, which is fair, but not the case for me.
* How well did it fit the prompt: Very well. Not only did it fit the prompt exactly, it also did it in a non obvious way.

**Short stories: Africa Risen: a New Era of Speculative Fiction edited by Sheree Renée Thomas, Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki, and Zelda Knight**

* An anthology of African and African diaspora SFF stories
* Mixed bag in that I liked some stories more than others. It ended up feeling a bit too long so that some stories dragged. I also would have liked it if it listed the cultures the stories were based off of, some weren’t obvious until I looked up the author.
* Similar books: I’m not a huge anthology person, Taaqtumi (Inuit horror anthology) is the only other one I’ve read recently. The introduction of Africa Risen mentions Dark Matter: A Century of Speculative Fiction from the African Diaspora, Dark Matter: Reading the Bones, Cotton Tree Root: Caribbean Fabulist Fiction, and Mojo: Conjure Stories, and a lot more, none of which I have read.
* How well did it fit the prompt: It fit. I think short story anthologies can be a great way to learn about new authors. I think ones themed around race/culture are a great way to learn about these issues and find underrepresented authors whose style works for me, so I’m planning on reading more.

**Horror: The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins**

* A librarian adopts and abuses some children so they get arcane knowledge. Now they’re adults, he’s missing, and they are *not* handling it well.
* It was interesting how the more horrific stuff in this book was treated so nonchalantly by the main characters. It was definitely an odd read, I just don’t know if it stuck with me.
* Similar books: The Magnus Archives came the closest, especially in season 5? They feel like they have a sort of similar vibe to me.
* How well did it fit the prompt: It definitely was more fantasy than a lot of other horror books, it didn’t feel like it used horror conventions much? I’ve learned that fiction books don’t really scare me, which is a con in that that’s what horror books are supposed to do, right? but a pro in that I don’t enjoy being scared, so I’ll probably read more horror books if they sound interesting now.

**Self Published: The Last Fang of God by Ryan Kirk**

* A father and daughter in a Norse inspired setting go on a journey so that the girl can complete a ritual or else she dies.
* This one felt pretty generic to me, and also the female lead was written exactly how an adult man views a stereotypical teenage girl. If you like quest/travel stories you might have better luck.
* Similar media: Take father daughter dynamic important directly from a family/children’s movie and put it in a norse inspired setting and make it more violent. I’m not going to bother with specific examples.
* How well did it fit the prompt: I was kind of hoping to find a book had even less ratings that was out for longer (I’ve read several books for my other card that fit that criteria), but I decided to pick one of the SPFBO finalists that fit the hard mode criteria and I could read via my library instead (Hoopla is very convenient). This book worked. Ironically, I also read a 2023 SPFBO contestant for my other card that got knocked out in the first round that I liked better.

**Middle East: We Hunt the Flame by Hafsah Faizal**

* Hunter girl and assassin boy go on a quest to find a MacGuffin.
* Not my favorite. It’s the type of YA fantasy story that I find pretty frustrating: the main plot ostensibly is the adventure quest thing, but if it comes between that and the romance, the romance is the author’s priority every time. The romance is also the attraction fueled enemies to lovers type thing that my brain is too aro ace to understand but I think is a major reason why a lot of people like it? The male lead is such an edgelord he was impossible for me to take seriously. The female lead was super talented and skilled right up until the narrative needed her not to be. I’m not in the target audience for this one, and I probably should have DNFed.
* (Not?) Similar books: The Bruising of Qilwa by Naseem Jamnia has the Middle East inspired world building (specifically Persian in this case). It is interested representing not just surface level details like foods, but also the way that distinctly different cultures in the area can come into conflict. Also, no romance, which is a plus for me.
* How well did it fit the prompt: It’s definitely inspired by the Middle East, but I’m going to leave it to own voices reviews to tackle how well it was handled overall.

**2023: Godkiller by Hannah Kaner**

* A grumpy Godkiller and a knight-turned-baker escort a girl and her small god to a city.
* Not a bad, but it didn’t amaze me. For some reason, it just felt a bit too generic for me. Maybe it was the quest/traveling part? I also really wanted >!to know where the little god came from!< but they didn’t answer it in this book, which was disappointing. The girl also wasn’t the most realistic child character I’ve read. I did like the representation in it—especially the disability representation. I’m not disabled, so I’m not an expert in what makes for good representation, but it felt like the author was trying for once which is honestly pretty rare in mainstream fantasy books.
* How well did it fit the prompt: It came out in 2023 and was a debut. I preferred my other card’s 2023 debut (The Meister of Decimen City).

**Multiverse: The Space Between Worlds by Micaiah Johnson**

* A woman works for a company to collect data from other dimensions where she has died. Things aren’t quite what they seem.
* I liked this book. I found the themes about class, race, abuse, and capitalism to be pretty interesting. I saw a lot of the twists coming, but they were still executed pretty well and the plot kept me engaged. However, the ending and the some of actions of the villain felt a bit unrealistic to me.
* How well did it fit the prompt: It was indeed a multiverse. I wanted to read a book with a multiple dimensions type storyline because I chose a portal fantasy for my other card.

**POC Author: Goliath by Tochi Onyebuchi**

* Literary sci fi that explores white flight, gentrification, and racial prejudice in a near future sci fi setting.
* I really liked the way this one explored it’s themes for the most part. It did a great job representing working class Black (and also Latino a bit) culture (according to own voices reviews I found). I haven’t seen these themes explored in any other book, so that was cool. That being said, >!there’s no way one nuclear plant melting down would cause the entire United States to basically collapse. Like it would be bad, but not that bad. Sorry, that broke my suspension of disbelief.!< It’s also a very 2020 book, because although these topics have been talked about for ages, you can really tell that it was informed by the author’s cynicism about what 2020s activism could accomplish. The ending was really abrupt.
* Similar books: Ummm…The Book of Phoenix by Nnedi Okorafor is a futuristic Black rage story. Although I think this one did a better job and is more grounded in reality where The Book of Phoenix is more mythic.
* How well did it fit the prompt: very well, if a bit depressingly. It’s also a bit more near future than distant future, but hey, that counts.

**Bookclub/readalong: The Justice of Kings by Richard Swan**

* A guy who’s a justice (jury, judge, and executioner) and his apprentice try to solve a murder mystery.
* I really felt nothing from this book. Like 0 connection to anything in it at all. IDK why. Maybe because the way it handled the justice system was so far removed to any real world commentary (at least, as far as I could tell), it felt kind of meaningless to me, it was more philosophical than practical? I will say that I was a bit annoyed at being constantly told how smart and amazing the female lead was, but she never shows it.
* Similar books: The Shamer’s Chronicles series. It deals with shame instead of justice, but is a great nuanced take on how shame/guilt is important in the justice system but can also be misused. It is YA though.
* How well did it fit the prompt: I did comment on the Goodreads book club post for it, so mission accomplished. I didn’t end up having too many good discussions on it (feeling nothing doesn’t inspire conversations), but it did get me in the habit of participating in book clubs more often, so that’s great. (Shoutout to Beyond Binaries for being a lot of fun!)

**Novella: The Deep by Rivers Solomon**

* Mermaid descendants of the pregnant women tossed overboard slave ships deal (or don’t deal) with generational trauma.
* I liked the themes, but could have used a more cohesive plot to make them blend in a bit more? It just felt a bit choppy to me. Either that or the book club discussion questions at the end of my copy really threw me off.
* Similar ~~books~~ media: Bookish Realm has some great YouTube videos ([short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSwibKs-1WQ), [long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP9OClvz4tE)) on Black mermaids in fiction (there’s a bunch of cool history and culture there that I didn’t know about before). Also, obviously, listen to [the clippings song The Deep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT1ujfuXFVo) and [Drexciya](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2F_tFo9aromxPVrWoO26LA) if you want to follow the inspiration. Also, there’s a lot of other art inspired by Drexciya’s ideas if you want to fall down a rabbit hole.
* How well did it fit the prompt: It was an interesting novella, but I think it felt a bit too choppy to me to really master the novella form imo. I was more interested in the ideas rather than the form.

**Mythical Beasts: The Black Gryphon by Mercedes Lackey and Larry Dixon:**

* A gryphon warrior and a healer/therapist/sex worker are friends in a war camp.
* Honestly, this one had a bit too much slice of life parts and not enough action for me. I can like books that are slice of life, but this one had a bit too much of a romance focus for me. It also had a bit too much black and white morality where it seemed like it was letting one character off the hook for doing some messed up stuff because he’s just obviously a good guy.
* How well did it fit the prompt: I wanted to read a griffon book, mission accomplished.

**Elemental Magic: Fire Logic by Laurie J Marks**

* Lesbian wanderer/cultural ambassador/warrior of a genocided people participates in a rebellion with the help of a peaceful, magical blacksmith with a drug addiction.
* A bit of a tough read at the time, but I liked it in general. The pacing should have felt more choppy than it did, and I liked the way the character relationships developed. Also, fun to read a queernorm book published in 2002. There was a bit of distance from the POVs though and certain themes I need to read the sequels on before I decide how I feel about them.
* Similar books: It had some similar classic fantasy vibes to like, The Deed of Paksenarrion, but not the same idealized good versus evil fight. It’s a weird book that feels both old and new at the same time.
* How well did it fit the prompt: Oddly. The elemental magic was more of a personality type thing with occasional non intuitive related magic powers (like intuition and visions for the ones with fire powers), rather than a straight forward, you control x element. But close enough for me.

**Myths and Retellings: Deerskin by Robin McKinley**

* A retelling of Donkeyskin about a woman recovering from some really traumatic events (>!rape, incest, miscarriage!<).
* Really beautifully written, and for the most part really sensitive. It did bother me a bit that the story criticized fairy-tale logic to explain how people dismissed the warning signs at the beginning, but >!leaned into it!< at the end to >!get the traditional happily ever after and magical healing.!< That being said, Ash and company are the best dogs.
* Similar books: Tess of the Road also deals with recovery from trauma, but with a bit more of a recovering from purity culture and family expectations bend as well, with a messy, complicated teenage protagonist. On a completely different note, for my other card I read The Ice Princess’s Fair Illusion by Dove Cooper, which was also a retelling of a lesser known problematic fairytale, although it was a lot less dark.
* How well did it fit the prompt: It was very recognizably a retelling, even if it did change a lot of the plot. I wanted to read a non-fantasy romance fairytale retelling story. There was some romance but that wasn't the focus.

**Queernorm setting: Witch King by Martha Wells**

* A demon body snatcher with pain magic wakes up from a year long sleep and wants to figure out who betrayed him and why + flashbacks to the past.
* This totally felt like a Martha Wells fantasy to me (very competent protagonist with trust issues and some found family elements? Yep, that's exactly what I'm looking for from her). It’s a lot less character focused than Murderbot and is more world building focused. I think some people were thrown off by the flashbacks interrupting the pacing. You also have to roll with the world building, not much gets explained.
* Similar books: Any other Martha Wells backlog fantasy (I’ve read Wheel of the Infinite, City of Bones, and Books of the Raksura) (Not Murderbot)
* How well did it fit the prompt: It was queernorm is a way that was surprisingly casual. Like there’s gay and lesbian relationships that were treated very normally. I also liked how no one’s gender was assumed by physical appearance alone (Kai used they/them pronouns for people until it was clear), which made sense considering how the demons work. I personally prefer the more aggressively queer mostly indie queernorm books that will make it incredibly obvious.

**Coast or Island Setting: A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin**

* A boy starts learning to become a wizard in wizard school and must overcome hubris.
* Not this book’s fault (it’s the original, or at least on older example), but it felt like I’ve already read too many of the plot beats in this already, so it didn’t feel new or that interesting. Even the magic system feels worn out to me now. >!Ged at least learned from his mistakes the first time,!< so that was nice.
* Similar books: Any other book with a know-it-all child/teen male main character who needs to learn the perils of hubris. Actually, a little like the King Killer Chronicles in that sense, but more to the point and with Ged actually having a character arc, unlike Kvothe. The magic seemed similar to Eragon, but I imagine Eragon got it from this book.
* How well did it fit the prompt: I mean, it fit perfectly based of the description of the prompt. I’ve heard that this book based off of Polynesian cultures and I was hoping for some more cultural elements to be represented, but besides the main character’s skin tone, I didn’t really see it. Admittedly, I listened to the audiobook narrated by Rob Inglis, and his extremely British voice did not help.

**Druids: Dreaming the Eagle by Manda Scott**

* A retelling of Boudica's life.
* This book was really well written, but the combination of slow pacing and traumatic events made it really hard to get through. I don’t think I can handle a sequel, especially since I know how it’s going to end. I liked the attention to detail when it came to the setting, and the author’s love of nature (and horses) really came through. I also liked how surprisingly queer it was. I shouldn’t have been so surprised, but I still was.
* Similar books: It reminded me a bit of Lavinia by Ursula K. Le Guin in that both are feminist retellings that felt like they stayed closer to the historical period. Also, there was a love of nature and a more mystical feeling to the fantasy elements of both. Lavinia was less dark though.
* How well did it fit the prompt: I feel like this one was prioritizing being historical fiction first, retelling/tragedy second, and fantasy a distant third, especially because the fantasy elements blended smoothly into the culture of the Iceni tribe. It was cool to see what actual Celtic druids might have been like (not that they were called druids).

**Featuring Robots: Klara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro**

* Robot doll makes observations about the world, makes friends with a chronically ill girl (as she is assigned to), and worships the sun for some reason?
* This book is a book about AIs—sorry AFs—written by someone who clearly has no clue how AIs actually work. Like Klara was written as an oddly stilted child with a bunch of quirky traits that no machine learning program would have (what on earth was up with the sun thing?). Also, the bond between Klara and Josie was pretty much unexamined, despite it being really messed up on a power balance and also codependence level. Even the themes about >!death and dying wasn’t dealt with enough focus or nuance for me, especially with the ending of Josie suddenly being healed!<. Also, >!the ending would have been so much cooler imo if it was ambiguous if Josie had been secretly replaced by an AF (new body + copy of Klara’s code) and was responding to the sun powering her up, or if the sun had actually healed Josie.!<
* Similar books: Speak by Louisa Hall! AI dolls written by someone who at least somewhat understands the theory and history behind machine learning and chatbots. It handles its themes better on almost every level in my opinion.
* How well did it fit the prompt: On a surface level? Klara is indeed a robot. Did Klara act like a robot? No. Maybe like a pop culture idea of what a robot is.

**Sequel: The Last Echo of the Lord of Bells**

* A giant battle with creative uses of magic to close out a series.
* It was a bit of a slow start, and some of the fighting was a bit tedious after so many pages, but hey, it did deliver everything I was expecting (creative uses of magic, very large battle) from this series’s finale.
* Similar books: Basically like Cradle’s finale, but not quite so overpowered.
* How well did it fit the prompt: Book 7 in a series isn’t bad. It’s nice to have closed the Mage Errant series out.

1711643020.0,The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon - A POV discussion (no major spoilers)," I want to preface this by saying *I liked this book in general!*

*However*…

Maybe it's just me, but I felt like >!Roos!< and >!Arteloth's!< points of view didn't *really* need to be there. I'm much more forgiving of >!Roos!< because his plotline ended up having an impact on the ending, but I found myself struggling not to skip over >!Loth's!< POV chapters because they were, in my opinion, unfortunately a bit boring and felt like an unwanted diversion considering everything else going on.

1711641779.0,Mad Ship Review (ROTE #5),"
Reminder: spoilers for Mad Ship! (Obviously) Also, all book reviews are solely my opinion, the good and the bad. Please don’t take any comments about a beloved or despised book personally, as we are all allowed our opinions. Cheers!

The Good:
- If there is one thing Robin Hobb does well it is her writing. She can take a story with so little plot and make it at least easy to read through good dialogue and understanding of character.
- Althea is my favorite character for this 2nd book, as she seems to have the most interesting journey. I like this coming of age, trying to prove yourself thing. (One of the reasons I like Fitz so much)
- The world building is still cool, but could be better (still good though)
- Amber’s twist I am lukewarm about. It’s kind of cool, and most of the books best quotes do come from her.
- Ronica is also a character I enjoy a lot, as she is by far the most mature. She admits her mistakes, and does her best to hold together a family that is falling apart.

The Bad:
- This book, like the last, is 400 pages too long… condense this story, and I really do believe it would improve vastly.
- Kennit’s character was by far my favorite in book 1. The issue comes from his leg. The thing that made him amazing was that he was bad ass and menacing. But since losing his leg, his is neither of those things, and he has become king of boring.
- Brasher is the MOST boring character, as he is just a romantic interest for Althea. (Weird that Robin Hobb would write such a cliche romance story between these two.) Althea wanting this ruggish, wrong-for-her man over the nice, safe man is such a boring, cliche plot line.
- Malta is still horrible… Reminds me of Sansa from GOT. People said she grew and become likeable too… but I never liked Sansa and doubt I’ll like Malta no matter her “growth”. And even if she was not insufferable, her POV chapters read like some bad tea-party—like I’m reading Pride and Prejudice—about proper manners as a lady…
- The serpent chapters… seriously… might be the worst things I’ve ever read. Confusing. Boring. Skippable.
- Again, I am surprised such a great character author could write as 1 dimensional villain as the Satrap. He has no depth, and shouldn’t even be in the book. (Expanding Kennits role as a villain would have been much better)

In Conclusion:
Robin Hobbs strength in writing has always been how she gets us to emotionally connect to characters. (This is why we cry so much when reading) It seems that when it comes to this, 1st person POV builds on that strength by focusing on one character and giving a strong sense of attachment. The Liveship Traders books lose this emotional connection from both the lack of 1st person POV, and from a cast of POV characters that is too large to give any single person enough time. I do applaud Robin Hobb for attempting a more traditional fantasy book with multiple POVs, but it just isn’t why I fell in love with her. I would be lying too, if I didn’t mention how the connections to Farseer actually weigh the books down. On its own, this series would be a little better, but because it MUST be read before Tawny Man, is serves as a long, long detour. (This annoyed me because of my desire to continue Fitz’s story and I know I am definitely not alone in that opinion, given how many “can I skip Liveship Traders?” posts I see online) But at the same time the connection to Farseer is what made me read it, as I’d have DNFed it in book 1 otherwise. 

Because of these things, I’ve decided to skip the last book in the trilogy (life is too short to read things you don’t enjoy) and move on to Tawny Man. A quick look at Ship of Destiny’s summary will do the best it can (and save me from another 850 pages) so I can understand any connections later on. Maybe one day I’ll come back and finish, but for now, on to better things!

1711628225.0,Other series with Robin Hobbs levels of characters and dialogue?,"I've recently rekindled my love of reading and fantasy, and I did it by reading through Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson and then the Farseer trilogy by Robin Hobb. 

I have to say, the quality of characters and dialogue was absolutely night and day. I enjoyed Mistborn a lot for the plot and the mystery and the revelations, but the characters were basically cardboard compared to Farseer, where almost each and every character and line of dialogue was an absolute delight and just oozing with life in comparison.

I do plan on continuing the Elderling series, but I'd like to know if there are any other authors that are widely known on this sub that do character work more like Hobb and less like Sanderson? I honestly can't really explain what exactly I even mean, but I don't think I'll be able to read Sanderson again after this level of whiplash lol ",Fantasy
1711628196.0,Some mini bingo reviews,"These reviews are on the Goodreads scale, so 1 – didn’t like, 2 – meh/was ok, 3 – liked, 4 – really liked, 5 – loved.

Some minor spoilers, I guess.

**Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi (Elemental Magic)** \- 2/5, DNF at 55%. It was fine, I didn't hate it, but I think I've reached an age where something YA has to be like, really good to grab me in, and I found this just a bit overly simplistic. Also thought some of the plot points were a bit silly - e.g. the main characters get found underground trying to break into a vault, give some absurd excuse to the guards and the plot just moves on.

**Silver in the Wood by Emily Tesh (Druids)** \- 4/5. Fun little story, with some impeccable vibes. I do love me a lush forest with some creeping horror elements, reminded me of Naomi Novik's Uprooted.

**Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro (Published in the 00s)** \- 3/5. There's an interesting story hidden around this somewhat boring school story. Some big emotional stuff at the end and I sort of liked the love story, but I spent a lot of the start and middle sitting there being like ""where is this going????"" while the protagonist was banging on about some high school nonsense. Also found the worldbuilding somewhat weird - I found it hard to believe a society that's so cruel in one specific way but yet doesn't seem particularly cruel in any other way?

**Kings of the Wyld by Nicholas Eames (Mythical Beasts)** \- 4/5. Funny, some heartfelt moments, well-written action, and really fun world. A bit long and overly complicated at times, could've lost a couple of side characters and not really lost much.

**The Jade Setter of Janloon by Fonda Lee (Superheroes)** \- 4/5. Great little novella with good tension. I loved the Green Bone Saga, so it was great to get back in the world.

**Bunny by Mona Awad (Magical Realism)** \- 2/5, DNF at 70%. I enjoyed some of the horror stuff and it has some nice prose, but this felt like it was going nowhere - the main character is under the thrall at like 30% through?? Also everyone in this is pretty annoying, which seems common in the horror books I've read. I would care so much more about bad things happening to these people if I....cared about them?

**Old Man's War by John Scalzi (Bottom of the TBR)** \- 4/5. Enjoyable, fast-paced, lots of well-written action. Main character was a bit of a Gary Stu, but had some nice emotional moments with the MC's dead wife and friends.

**Sabriel by Garth Nix (Young Adult)** \- 3.5/5. Lots of stuff to like: interesting necromancy magic, I liked the mashup of WW1-era vs fantasy world, briskly paced, some fun horror vibes. However, the characters felt a bit flat and some parts of the plot felt underexplained (i.e. stuff just happened it felt like out of nowhere with no real explanation).

**Legends and Lattes by Travis Baldree (Mundane Jobs)** \- 4/5. I felt like this knew exactly what it was going for (fun, low stakes, chill), and achieved it. You can see every plot beat coming, but that's also the point, and I thought it was engagingly written.

**Sharp Ends by Joe Abercrombie (5 short stories)** \- 4.5/5. Some great stories - I enjoyed the Shev/Javre one where they meet Cracknut Whirrun at the bridge, the battle one with Bremer dan Gorst and especially the one about Logen. I think overall the collection feels slightly less than the sum of its parts because each story is quite actiony, so overall it feels a little samey in rhythm. I think the best short story collections have a good mix of short and long so you can read the whole thing in one go (if you so wanted) and don't feel like you're reading the same story over and over.

**Tiamat's Wrath by James S.A. Corey (Sequel)** \- 4/5. I've generally liked but not loved the Expanse books, but enjoyed this one. Plot, worldbuilding and pacing (past the first 50 or so pages) were great. I have to say by this point in this series I found the Rocinante crew pretty annoying. I wish the authors had moved on from them!

**There Is No Antimemetics Division by qntm (Self-published) -** 4/5. Fantastic and thought provoking, loved heaps of it. Feels sort of like a short story collection as it jumped around, a great mix of horror and sci fi, with really engaging prose. Loses a point for confusing me with all the time skips, and I don't think it ended as well as it started. But, very enjoyable.

**The Blacktongue Thief by Christopher Buehlman (Title with a title)** \- 1.5/5, DNF at 25%. This didn't do much for me. Not badly written in a prose sense, but I did not care about the plot or the characters, and found the constant infodumps incredibly grating. I do not care about all the kingdoms and gods and names for each rank of thief unless you give me a reason to, I did not find them interesting in and of themselves.

**Hell Bent by Leigh Bardugo (Angels and Demons)** \- 3.75/5. Enjoyable, a little long, but fairly fast paced. Story had some real high points - especially getting the backstory of all the different characters - but I felt it was a little confusing at times (>!why did Darlington suddenly appear and how his whole demon deal worked!<)and had some slightly contrived plot holes (why didn't the main character just show >!demon Darlington to Anselme!<???)

**The City of Brass by S. A. Chakraborty (Middle Eastern SFF)** \- 2/5. DNF at like 40%. Not bad, but just not feeling this. Kind of cool world, but felt YA-y in having a teenager's view of the world and a bit annoyingly Marvely in its quippiness.

**Lovecraft Country by Matt Ruff (Horror)** \- 3.5/5. I enjoyed this, but didn't find it particularly horrory or particularly Lovecraftian, I thought. The segregation aspect is very unpleasant but not 'horror' to me - it's not scary to me, just kind of horrible. Has the structure of a collection of short stories, some of which were great, some not so great.

**Piranesi by Susanna Clarke (Multiverse)** \- 4/5. Such a weird, interesting world that felt very unique and compelling. The first half was a 5-star to me but the second half (where most of the plot happened) didn't compel me as much. Maybe the mystery was better off not explained!

**Zone One by Colson Whitehead (POC author)** \- 2/5, DNF at 20%. Just really, really overdone prose. Like, hard to follow what was even going on because of constant annoying pop cultury digressions.

**The Poppy War by R.F. Kuang (Book Club)** \- 2.5/5, DNF at 64%. Was fine, readable, but pretty flawed. No particularly interesting character work, prose was workable but nothing special, weird plot that kepy jumping around. I enjoyed the school portion but it had weird jumps and the second part wasn't as interesting.

**To be Taught, if Fortunate by Becky Chambers (Novella)** \- 5/5. Wonderful little novella, some great and inventive alien world scifi stuff as well as some strong emotional stuff with the characters' depression and feelings about their purpose. Really good.

**Autonomous by Annalee Newitz (Coastal/Island setting)** \- 3/5. Some interesting parts around bot-human relation and drugs/patents. Didn't really care about any of the characters and hence, the plot, really. Didn't really feel to me like the worldbuilding was that developed - there's hints of climate stuff but it didn't feel fully realised? Prose was good and smooth, was easy to read.

**A Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine (Queernorm setting)** \- 4/5. A super interesting world with well-written, likeable characters, and some really nice prose. Often funny as well. Lost a point because the prose, while often very good, is \*dense\*. I really had to read closely on a sentence by sentence basis to follow what was going on, and I felt the second half was not quite as strong as the first.

**The Infinite and the Divine by Robert Rath (Non-human protagonist, replacing Myths and Retellings)** \- 4/5. Very enjoyable, fun and well-written story. Good just as a book, not just good for a Warhammer book. I really liked the interplay between Trazyn and Orikan. Has lots of good action, but to be honest, had a bit \*too\* much action. I know the point of Warhammer books is to sell miniatures so they have to write a lot about making them fight each other, but I kind of wish they just....didn't so much.

**Day Zero by C. Robert Cargill (Featuring Robots)** \- 4.5/5. Super fast paced and well written story of the robot apocalpyse. I really felt the dread when shit started to fall apart. Loses a little for feeling slightly simplistic (in a kind of prose sense) and maybe feeling rushed at the end. But really good.

**The Crane Husband by Kelly Barnhill (Published in 2023)** \- 3.5/5. Weird, but good. Really effectively built tension in a short space of time, but ended a little abruptly.",Fantasy

1711622911.0,RIP fantasy author James A. Moore,"James was the author of over 40 novels, fantasy, horror, and thrillers.

I remember the release of the first book in his Seven Forges series, which spanned a decade, the sixth being released last summer.

I interacted with him only a little, but they were good encounters. I was waiting for someone who knew him better to post about his passing, but hopefully those people can chip in here.

He was the same age as me, wrote far more books, and from the posts on Facebook and Twitter, it's obvious he'll be deeply missed.",Fantasy
1711615886.0,Thomas Covenant,"I'm in my 50s and have only just started the series. (Just finished chapter 10 of Lord Foul's Bane.) One of the reasons I've put it off for so long is because of *that* moment. The prospect of reading a series in which a rapist is the hero never  particularly appealed to me.

Having read almost 200 pages, though, I now understand why the series is so well-regarded. Mostly, it's because the central character is so well-written. Covenant is a profoundly damaged character. His leprosy has necessitated a closing of his mind and personality; his arrival in a world populated by welcoming and warm people enables the writer to explore that flawed personality through contrast. He's not remotely suitable for the role fate has bestowed upon him. In the fight against the ur-viles, he not only gets overwhelmed but doesn't really know what to do, is slow and ends up on his backside remarkably quickly.

And, I kind of like that. Not because I like seeing main characters fail, particularly, but because it's a useful reminder that doing the right thing usually costs in some way and is seldom easy.

Donaldson's characterisation of Covenant is not exactly sympathetic but it's skilful enough that it helps the reader understand why he is the way he is.

The world-building is becoming more intriguing, too. Might post about that later.",Fantasy

I’ve been thoroughly impressed by everything that this book had to offer from the prose to the character development to the world building it’s been a magical experience that I just want to go back to.

1711605749.0,The Unicorn Saga by John Lee,"Did anyone else read these books from the 80s or did I fall into a unicorn dimension? It's a 5 book series, The Unicorn Quest, The Unicorn Dilemma, The Unicorn Solution, The Unicorn Peace, and The Unicorn War.

I found the fifth book in a thrift store as a kid, my fantasy-inclined horsegirl personality leaping at the chance to read something combining those interests. However it was far too advanced for me to understand, and took a couple years of eBay hunting to gather the rest of the series (the first book being the last I acquired 🙃). 

I did read them as a kid, understanding very little from the flowery language, but have recently decided to begin reading the series again. It's amazing how much more of the plot I can understand now! Not that any of the fantasy words make any more sense. Still I'm happy to say I love the story even more now.

1711596358.0,2023 Bingo reviews - 1st completed card,"This was my first completed Bingo on this sub. Last year was my first year participating, and I only got 23 out of 25 of the spaces filled. I used u/AuthorKEMott’s handy Bingo Matrix assistant to help optimize my card and then did some rearranging.

This is also my first time writing any sort of extended review. I’m hoping to get a closer look at the kinds of things I enjoy reading. Some of my impressions will be vaguer due to the amount of time that’s passed since I thought about these books.

**Row 1**

Title with a Title: *The Thief* by Megan Whalen Turner \[HM\] (also TBR, YA) -- This was a very good read. Main character was likeable.

Superheroes: *The Girl Who Could Move Sh\*t with Her Mind* by Jackson Ford \[HM\] -- Action-packed, girl with superpowers induced by mad-scientist parent meddling pressed into service of a secret government agency crewed by a bunch of misfits working to clear her name when someone with her powers starts killing people. I zoomed through it. Liked it, but did not love it.

Bottom of the TBR \[no HM\]: *The Deathsniffer’s Assistant* by Kate McIntyre (also Title \[HM\], Self-Pub/Indie) -- I picked this book up some time ago and put it down because it just didn’t hook me. Found it again now and appreciate it a lot more, especially after reading the sequel, which I also read and further develops the characters. Book four (the conclusion) is currently written but in limbo due to problems with the original publisher.

Magical Realism/Literary Fantasy: *大武山下 (At the Foot of Mount Kavulungan)* by Lung Ying-tai \[HM\] (also Mundane Jobs, Author of Color) -- Started reading this in April. Took an extended hiatus because I was promised a ghost but she doesn’t appear until about 1/3 of the way through. (I stopped the chapter before she shows up for real.) Just finished it on 3/24. The first third is the main character meeting all her (eccentric) neighbors, and then the last third is the resolution of the ghost girl’s story. 4/5 stars because I cried in chapter 77.

Young Adult: *The Sinister Booksellers of Bath* by Garth Nix \[HM\] (also Title with a Title \[HM\], Mundane Jobs, 2023, Elemental Magic \[HM\], Seque) -- Solid follow-up to book 1. Nice to see Vivien taking a more prominent role though the stars are still clearly Susan and Merlin.

**Row 2**

Mundane Jobs: *Star Wars Medstar I: Battle Surgeons* by Michael Reeves, Steve Perry \[HM\] (also Title \[HM\], 00’s \[HM\], Robots) -- I bought book 2 years ago and liked it. Finally getting around to reading book 1, though I don’t count it for TBR since it was never on my to-read list. Have heard it compared to M*A*S\*H, and I think the description is pretty apt. It has been some time since I read a Star Wars book. It was fine, but the characterizations felt kind of shallow. Maybe I would have liked it more if I'd read it at the same time as I did the other one.

Published in the 2000s: *Grimspace* by Ann Aguirre \[HM\] (also TBR) I would have been all over this book about fifteen years ago, but the me now just wasn’t that into it. Tastes moving on I suppose.

Angels and Demons: *The Glass God* by Kate Griffin (also Title \[HM\], Mundane Jobs, Mythical Beast, Druid \[HM\], Sequel) -- Everyone in this series is so, so mundane, while also being magical, which causes quite a few problems for people like the druid, Rhys, with bad allergies, and vampire Kevin, who’s a germaphobe. They’re all just trying their best. The plot kicks off because the Midnight Mayor, possessed of the blue electric angels, goes missing, and they have to find him before everything falls to pieces. The antagonist is easily disliked, but also just kind of pathetic. I particularly liked how everyone who dies essentially gets a special chapter that gives a bit of insight into their thoughts and motivations, making it all the more tragic.

5 Short Stories: *The Best of Connie Willis* \[HM\] -- There was a lot of loss to read here, but also some good comedy. Reviewing the list of stories here, the ones that stood out that I still remember were “A Letter from the Clearys,” “Last of the Winnebagos,” and “Inside Job.”

Horror: *Nightwise* by R.S. Belcher \[HM\] (also Angels and Demons, Multiverses \[HM\], Title \[HM\]) -- Main character is on the dark side of gray who does objectively terrible things, thinks he’s a lost cause, and is of the “I hurt my friends to keep them away so they won’t get caught up in all my troubles” school or trying to protect people. Fortunately for him, they are not as put off by his behavior as he would want and continue to support him. Not really my thing. I previously enjoyed Belcher’s Weird West horror novel, The Six-Gun Tarot, but that was also about ten years ago so no idea if I’d still like it today.

**Row 3**

Self Published or Indie: *The Bruising of Qilwa* by Naseem Jamia \[HM\] (also Middle East \[HM\], POC, Novella \[HM\], Queernorm \[HM\]) -- Fine, but stylistically(?) not my thing.

ETA: Actually, thinking further, I think my main problem with this book was the pacing.

Set in the Middle East: *The Daughters of Izdihar* by Hadeer Elsbai \[HM\] (also 2023 \[HM\], POC, Book Club) -- It was okay, unevenly enjoyable, but good enough that I will be reading the sequel to follow up with that cliffhanger.

Published in 2023: *The Mountain in the Sea* by Ray Nayler \[HM\] (also Mundane Jobs, Coastal \[HM\], Robots) -- Top book I’ve read this year. 5/5 stars. Marketing works, because I only heard about this book because it won the Goodreads Choice Awards. Really enjoyed the contemplative, gray, gloomy feel of it, and the ending was suitably satisfying and hopeful.

Multiverses: *Unraveling* by Karen Lord \[HM\] (also Angels and Demons, POC, Sequel) -- This is a sequel to Redemption in Indigo, following Paama’s sons. Ostensibly a murder mystery, there’s a lot more going on. Worth giving a revisit in the future, I think. I feel like there’s a lot of depth I missed the first time around.

Author of Color: *Abengoni: The First Calling* by Charles Saunders (also Self-Pub, Coastal) -- I was actually looking for *Dossouye*, since I had previously read the related short story in Jessica Amanda Salmonson’s *Amazons!*, but could only find this one. It was supposed to be the start of a new series, but he died before continuing it. I started reading this near the end of the 2022 period for the Set in Africa square, but it was the last day and I knew I’d probably hate it if I tried to force myself to read it all at once. In the end, it turned out to be a pretty enjoyable read. It is clearly a first book, but the main plot wraps up nicely about two thirds of the way in, after >!the invasion!<. In fact, I was surprised there was still more book at that point.

**Row 4**

Book Club/Readalong: *City of Stairs* by Robert Jackson Bennett (also Multiverse \[HM\]) -- I thought I hadn’t finished reading this, but a look at my history said I had. Just as good, maybe even better, the second time around. I started City of Blades but that had even more worn-down people persevering and sacrificing, and I was reading a lot of that kind of book at the time so I really just needed a bit of a palate cleanser.

Novella: *The Retrieval Artist* by Kristine Kathryn Rusch \[HM\] (also 00s) Very noir feel, complete with private detective in a seedy office approached by desperate woman. Extremely conflicted by the ending, which made sense in the context of the story, but not a happy or even all that satisfying of an ending. This was the first entry in a series of novels and takes place quite a bit down the internal timeline. After jumping on here, not sure if if I can handle the whiplash of going back in time with the main character where I imagine he's a very different person.

Mythical Beasts: *Two Serpents Rise* by Max Gladstone \[HM\] (also Mythical Beasts \[HM\], Book Club, Sequel) I read this and the first book, *Three Parts Dead*, this year and enjoyed them both. Liking the juxtaposition of Theology and Craft and the contractual underpinnings of power.

Elemental Magic: *Notorious Sorcerer* by Davinia Evans \[HM\] (also Title \[HM\], Angels and Demons, Multiverses \[HM\], Book Club, Coastal) -- This book took me quite a bit of time to read (but not as long as my entry for Literary Fantasy) but it was worth it to complete. There is a sense of wonder and curiosity as we follow Siyon (who does not have the learning of the other practitioners and I understood about as much as he did when they started talking about it) and figure out how the world works. Not without pining and tragedy (sort of).

Myths and Retellings: *巫王志·卷四 (Chronicles of the Sorcerer King Book 4)* by Zheng Feng \[HM\] (also Title, POC, Mythical Beasts, Sequel \[HM\]) -- This is a 5-part series of historical fiction/wuxia novels set in the Shang period about the reign of Wu Ding, following his son, Zi Yao (probably the historical Zu Geng/Zi Yue). It would be very hard to discuss book 4 without spoiling previous installments, but there’s some stuff here I was surprised by, and I may have to revisit earlier books to see if I missed any hints. Things are ramping up. Also, >!Dawu Gu kind of sucks, actually.!< I wanted to use it for Shapeshifters \[HM\] last year, but didn’t get around to reading it in time.

**Row 5**

Queernorm Setting: *The Warden* by Daniel M. Ford \[HM\] (also Title \[HM\], 2023) -- Feels like an TTRPG novel in the vein of Dungeons and Dragons? I liked it, though it wasn't amazing, and I liked that the main character is a necromancer in addition to her other magical expertise, and I will read the sequel to see what happens.

Coastal Setting: *A Wizard of Earthsea* by Ursula K. Le Guin \[HM\] (also Title \[HM\], TBR, YA, Book Club) Loved the stylistic and mythic quality about this book. Have been meaning to read this for years and it did not disappoint.

Druids: *The Jasmine Throne* by Tasha Suri \[HM\] (also POC, Book Club, Mythical Beasts \[HM\]) -- Very good. The kind of book where I can well imagine things are going to get a lot worse before they get better for the rest of the series.

Features Robots: *The Jinn-Bot of Shantiport* by Samit Basu \[HM\] (also Mundane Jobs \[HM\], 2023, POC \[HM\], Myths \[HM\], Coastal) -- I previously read Basu’s The City Inside, and I think I just don’t really like his writing, though the characters are fun. Sometimes very silly and sometimes heroic.

Sequel: *System Collapse* by Martha Wells \[HM\] – also 2023, Book Club, Novella, Queernorm, Robots A solid Murderbot entry but does not particularly stand out. Big fan of every >!Murderbot-other SecUnit interaction!<. Can certainly see that become a recurring thing.

**Final thoughts**

Got through quite a few books on my TBR this year, including titles that didn't make it into my card. Also, my method of just reading as much as possible and then going back and trying to assign squares is working out for me. I was in a bit of a slump, and 2023 was a good year for getting back into reading regularly again.",Fantasy

**Type:** A fantasy romance — no preference on which one it gears toward. Some people call this low or urban fantasy.


**Setting:** It takes place **at least partially** in modern day Earth — cell phones, internet, all that jazz. If there is a secondary setting, it can be high or urban fantasy. *Examples: Guild Codex series, Dragon Heart Legacy, A Curse So Dark and Lonely, The Magicians*


**FMC:** A woman, aged 25+, who is known for more than being hot, bratty, dumb, and/or klutzy. Although she herself may or may not be magical, she is not exposed to magic until the story starts. *Examples: Tori from Guild Codex: Spellbound, Breen from the Dragon Heart Legacy, Eve from Eaternal Nocturnals*


**MMC:** A man, aged 25+, who is known for being intense. He can be a villain, hero, or morally gray. Likely, he's a bit broody, very powerful, has a lot of banter with FMC, and eventually becomes incredibly protective of her. He's also likely OP as shit. *Examples: InuYasha from InuYasha, Zak from Guild Codex, Zuko from Avatar the Last Airbender*


**Spice:** Don't care. Closed door to 5 chili peppers works.


**Magic System:** Magic can exist only in our world, only in the secondary setting, or both. But, in our world, magic is not the norm and most people don't know about it. *Examples: Guild Codex, Dragon Heart Legacy, Magicians, respectively*


**Audience:** ADULT. Please no young adult.


**Bonus Points:** A scene where the fantasy-grounded MMC is confused by our world in an adorable/hilarious/interesting way. *Examples: InuYasha at the grocery store, Zylas from the Guild Codex: Unveiled in the pizza shop, etc.*


**Can't do:** Any story where the problem could be resolved simply by talking to each other, breeding kinks, fated mates, third act breakups,  pregnancy, slavery, Ilonia Andrews (already read), Ruby Dixon (doesn't do it for me)

1711593843.0,"Terry Pratchett's the Colour of Magic parts 1 and 2: ""The Colour of Magic"" and ""The sending of Eight""","First time reading Terry Pratchett.

**The Colour of Magic**

This was such a joy to read.  

The hook and intro of the city catching on fire pulled me in unlike many other books I've read lately.  The weird world we are introduced to is...okay.  A little offputting at first, but it grew on me.

The plot of learning how the city catches on fire is solid, though what the purpose of it was and the ending did confuse me.  Why did we need that final scene with the two hero's discarding the clock imp?  What was the point of that scene with the messenger bird flying above the other messenger bird?  When I learned this was not a self-contained story, rather the beginning of a longer adventure, I could forgive these things more, but they will need to pay off later.  Otherwise, it was wasted words.  Overall, it isn't a masterful plot or anything near it, just a solid little adventure.

Going a little deeper into theme, one concern is the possible trope of civilized man stumbles into dumb, primitive people.  Two Fingers seems to be a stand-in for a more modern society, while the local people are ""dumb barbarians"" who believe in magic.  There's still 3 more stories to go at this point, so this interpretation could be off.  And even if this is a theme in the story, we can't put all the blame on Terry as it is a common theme played out in much literature of the time.  Still, gave me a wince when I saw the parallels.  

What really makes this story special is the humor and Terry's prose.  This author can make a mundane scene a joy to read simply by how he tells it, and how we see it unfold.

> ""Asoniti!  Kyorucha! Beazleblor!""  The man hesitated, his eyes flickering nervously from side to side as he waited for the magic.  The conclusion that there was not going to be any hit him at the same time as Rincewind, whirring wildly down the passage, kicking him sharply in the groin.

Take this passage for example.  What a way to describe action and idea in one sentence as, ""the conclusion [...] hit him at the same time as Rincewind.""  And the story is littered with brilliant prose like this.

The humour had me laughing and pulled me on just as much as the prose.  The magic of *echo-gnomics*, *in-sewer-ants*, and the photograph taking imp was all splended (if we can ignore the pro-colonial implications).

The biggest downside in Terry's writing so far is his characters.  The treasure chest has more character than the humans.  Rincewind is a passive insert for the reader, and the other characters are copy-pasted caricatures, often of each other.  Dialogue seems to come from the narrators mouth rather than the people speaking the words.  Hopefully this gets better as the story progresses.

**The Sending of Eight**

Characterization gets better!  Rincewind starts to take shape as we learn more about his past and his possessive spell.  Some of the new characters we get, namely the gods, have distinct personalities.  Perhaps they are still just caricatures, but least it works since they are gods.  Hrun is another caricature.  Two-flowers is still a caricature.

Plot-wise, its both a hit and a miss.  The gods playing DND with the characters is an excellent idea, and for the most part well executed.  It just breaks my immersion when a troll teleports out of nowhere because...a dice roll?  And (major spoiler) >!while tentacle eye monster getting defeated by photograph is both funny and well set up, it seems a bit much.  If the eye is really that sensitive, wouldn't any arrow or sword strike to it do the same?  If so, this ancient, powerful being is really quite vulnerable.!<

Learning more about the world is a joy.  The taboo around the number that is equal to four times two was a fun ride.  The colonizer's trope mentioned in ""The Colour of Magic"" review above is weakened by this story, which is a relief.  Magic is real, silly taboo around a number has merit.  The local folk aren't all lunatics, even if we still have dumb barbarians.

The prose in this story dipped by a hair.  We didn't get as many brilliant and witty sentences or phrases.  We also get this passage:

> Rincewind watched Hrun over the top of his slab of greasy meat.  Hrun going about the business of being a hero, he realized, was quite different to the wine-bibbing, carousing Hurn who occasionally came to Ankh-Morpork.  He was cat-cautious, lithe as a panther, and thoroughly at home.

> And I've survived Bel-Shamharoth, Rincewind reminded himself.  Fantastic.

Without further context, ""Fantastic"" here seems to be sarcastic.  A pitying comparison between Rincewind and this legended hero.  Yet, we know Bel-Shamharoth is an incredibly powerful being.  Surviving it really would be fantastic, an accomplishment to be proud of.  Maybe I'm not understanding the use of the word ""fantastic"" here, but it feels like a missed point.

Overall, I'm very impressed with Terry's talent in prose and worldbuilding.  I look forward to reading more of Discworld.",Fantasy

In this case it didn't really bother me since it was more used as a descriptive word that the reader can understand.

1711580629.0,The Starless Sea,"Just finished listening to the audiobook for The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern. I found this book when looking for recommendations similar to Piranesi, which is one of my favorite books. And it definitely delivered. I found it very compelling and the way the different stories intertwined was so brilliantly done. The whole thing was so lush and beautiful. It was often meandering and lacked strong direction but I think that was an intentional choice that worked well. I really liked the unconventional structure. Also, the audiobook is excellently directed with 6 narrators for the different storylines. I do think a disadvantage is that while all the stories intertwined, they didn't necessarily have a consistent theme or message. There were the themes of the importance of stories, endings, love, bravery, open access to knowledge, etc. But it's hard to determine one overarching theme.

I found the idea of a character who has missed their chance to be part of a magical world as a kid, and then rediscovers it as an adult, very relatable. Like a lot of kids, I was obsessed with fantasy books and was convinced I was going to get my Hogwarts letter. As I got older I stopped reading but I've been getting back into it the past year or two and finding that magic again.

Everything happened too quickly, and I didn’t understand the politics or the characters’ motivations. But by the end, I was hooked. I realized then that Glen Cook doesn’t believe in spoon-feeding his readers. And the description of the war was amazing. It felt epic in scale and, at the same time, realistic, even though magic was involved.

I didn't read as many of my backlist TBR as I had hoped. Next year I aim only to read a new read if I don't already own something for that space.

The books I pushed myself to finish in the last year instead of DNFing were for this bingo. Next year I aim to be more consistent and aim to finish earlier so that I can DNF books that aren't working and still complete it. I think this reflects in my average rating of 3.5 which is lower than my 2023 average.

Hi readers!

I’ve been trying to get into John Gwynne’s Faithful and the Fallen books for, like, forever. I’ve started and stopped Malice like 4-5 times at least, finding the story very heavy and just, well, a lot to take in. 

I’ve read a few posts saying things along the lines of “just push through the first 2/3 of the book,” and tried - and failed lol. I am primarily an ebook reader, but finally just requested a copy of Malice from my local library bc I didn’t want to read the first 100+ pages again and find it’s easier to skim with physical books, and am here to say…

…Chapter 47. Make it to Chapter 47 and all the development that has been occurring for ~checks the book~ 364 pages comes together to something that so far is just truly great. I just finished Malice and can’t wait to start book 2, Valor!",Fantasy

Normally, we listen to audiobooks by Terry Pratchett or Douglas Adams or Neil Gaiman - we like that kind of fantasy with a quirky side-eye and progressive philosophy behind it.  


I'd love to find something similar that isn't so extremely White/European.  I think the boys would love Terry Pratchett, mind you, and I want to introduce them - but I also want to find some kind of adventure story where they can see themselves.  I've been scouring book reccomendation lists and almost everything that's recommended is just not lighthearted.  The only thing I can think of that's even close is Lovecraft Country (not a Black author but at least the main characters are Black and basically ordinary people to start with) were appropriate, but there's way too much adult stuff.

In my case, it could be that with Tolkien the journey is very dense (But in reality that is something that gives pleasure to the story, it is a good way to represent the desire to return home due to the fatigue of the journey) and Perhaps such detailed descriptions of food are unnecessary.

My second author would be Sanderson, and the truth is that I think he should have taken Tolkien's example and left all the romance behind, it is no secret that Sanderson is not the first person you would think of recommending regarding this genre.

1711552732.0,[Review] Hills of Heather and Bone by K.E. Andrews (SPFBO-9 Finalist),"**I read this for SPFBO. My review only. More about the contest and links at the bottom.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say opposite attract and I can’t think of anyone more different to one another than Morana and her husband Percy.

**Percy** is a fleshmender, a healer. Double gifted; he can heal both plant and animals. He is as fun and light, as you would expect of someone who can bring life and healing to those around them.

**Moranna** is a boneweaver. A practice that is feared by most; her gift lets the dead raise. She hears their life stories and part of the price of her gift is listening and retelling them.

As you can imagine, as someone who deals with death and the threat of it every day Moranna, is a bit more subdued than her pun-happy husband Percy.

**Hills of Heather and Bone** is just a pretty book. The presentation- between the cover, the interior art, the chapter headings (which I loved) and the style it was written, even the story itself was atmospherically pretty. I even dare to say- this was without a doubt the loveliest version of necromancy I have ever read.

The prose is a bit thicker than I tend to like these days, but it does suit the setting and the story, and just that all-around tone it has going for it of life and death and everything that comes in between and I was sold by chapter four.

I had a few complaints- mostly to do with repetition but that’s a hard trench to straddle, when you are spending so much time in one character’s head in a smaller stakes story like this one. So, it’s a very small complaint.

\*

This was labeled cottage-core (something I’ve never heard of) but it likely fits better than “cozy fantasy” since Hills of Heather and Bone can be sorrowful at times with explorations of grief themes and depression- it’s just a little heavier emotionally than what I usually think of when thinking “cozy”.

\*

I was very grateful for the way this ended. I felt the heaviness of the story deserved an ending that would ease our hearts and I was very much afraid we were going to be given what I like to call “\*the Deveraux ending”.

I left the story feeling satisfied and at ease. (I hope that is not too spoilery to say)

&#x200B;

PS.\*If you want to know why then give Jude Deveraux’s A Knight in Shining Armor a read.

I mean we get it, you wake up everyday wishing you were Joe Abercrombie, but you're not, try something else for once. 

I don't hate grimdark fantasy, I think it can be really fun, but when all you read is grimdark, it starts to lose its charm.

**GRRM -**

I had read ASOIAF books 10+ years ago, and started reading way before the tv show. Completed the series after the TV show started.

After that, I lost touch with the fantasy genre, and recently am trying to get back to fantasy again ( need some escape while reading is one of the main reasons) I read more R.R. Martin - Dunk and Egg, Fire and Blood.

Though I found the story of Fire and Blood ok, I rather preferred the pov- based chapters in ASOIAF than historical record style writing.

**Other fantasy**

I tried the classics like Hobbit, LOTR didn't like them (I know it's critically acclaimed and everything but it just not to my liking).

I liked Dune (only the first book).

I liked the first book of Shattered Sea trilogy, but I would prefer novels that aren't YA.

1711548142.0,Omelas: A fantastic response & analysis,"If you haven't read Ursula K Le Guin's fantastic and seminal short story ""The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas"", stop here and read that now. Its only five pages and it'll stay with you. Out of consideration for those yet to read it but who are reading this post, I've marked the analysis below in spoilers.

For those who do not know, ""Omelas"" has over the years spawned a number of responses, by writers imagining how they would address the central paradox at the heart of the story. Perhaps most famously NK Jemesin's ""The Ones Who Stay and Fight"", which you can find freely on Lightspeed magazine.

Thanks to a post on r/printsf, I came across this fantastic response published in February's edition of Clarkesworld. The title itself is a bit of a spoiler for the original tale, [so I'll just link to the story here](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kim_02_24/). The author is Isabel Kim. Do yourself a favour and read this. Its brilliant, darkly funny and bitingly satirical, and is as short as the original ""Omelas"" to boot. It is one of the most enjoyable short stories I've read in ages.

A brief and superficial analysis follows, in spoiler tags, simply because I'd love to hear thoughts on this and have the story shared more widely.

>!Le Guin's original story has been subject to considerable analysis. The central idea is that even a ""perfect"" society is predicated on suffering, and all are complicit. Some have called it a critique of capitalism - how we collectively collude in the suffering of children & others in sweatshops and warzones around the world to get our Iphones and Nikes and coffee on demand at cheap prices.!<

>!Kim offers a more cynical, fatalistic take, whilst skewering all the absurdities of our modern age, social media, populism, terrorism, hyper-tribalism, hypocrisy. It is not capitalism that is the problem, she argues, the problem is humans: still tribal and petty despite all of our technological progress, and that intractable problems - inequality, housing, climate change as examples - are intractable precisely because they involve a sacrifice that society, collectively, is unwilling to pay, and even that the solutions can be worse than the problem they are trying to address.!<

>!Crucially, in both stories the Ones Who Walk Away remain few in number - very few will voluntarily unplug themselves from the system - whereas the Ones Who Will Rage on Social Media are very many.  We (mostly) collectively want to break our dependence on oil, or have lots of cheap housing for the less well off, but we also need to drive to work, or want to fly on regular holidays, or want our houses to increase in value, and so winning the culture wars becomes the proxy for our inability go solve the real problems.!<",Fantasy

1711546295.0,All-horror 2023 bingo card + mini-reviews,"For the r/fantasy bingo this year, I decided to try filling an entire card with horror (or at least horror-adjacent) books.

Why? Well, I’ve been reading an increasing amount of horror over the last several years, and r/horrorlit doesn’t run a reading challenge. Plus, with the “Horror” square in the bingo this year, I thought this would be a nice way to share some books that might not be on everyone’s radar here — which probably would have worked better if I’d finished it up sooner.

I used to avoid the genre myself to a degree when I was younger. Although I liked classic Gothic works and got into fantasy in part through the New Weird, my idea of modern horror was largely based on blood-spattered trailers for movies I was scared to watch.

Nothing wrong with a little blood spatter, but really, horror encompasses a huge range of styles and subjects. I’ve tried to give some idea of that range in my reviews.

Feel free to comment about your own experience with the horror square this year. I know this sub has a good number of horror/weird fiction fans already, but I’m curious whether bingo has won over any new readers.

# Row 1

**Title with a title:** [Queen of Teeth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58556306-queen-of-teeth) by Hailey Piper

* Love to write an intro inviting new readers into the horror genre, and then start with a mutant vagina dentata. Sink or swim, folks. This novel is fun, rebellious and deliberately over-the-top — a fast-paced story of revenge, queer love and monstrous self-determination.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: body horror, biological experiments, corporatized health care*

**Superheroes:** [Hellboy Omnibus, Vol. 4: Hellboy in Hell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36317119-hellboy-omnibus-volume-4) by Mike Mignola (hard mode)

* It’s hard to review the last book in a series independently, but I thought this was a solid ending for the Hellboy comics. While it’s above all a pulpy adventure series, full of demonic and Lovecraftian horrors getting punched in the face, it has a poignant side as well that especially comes out in this volume.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: fate, death, other things that can’t easily be punched in the face*

**Bottom of the TBR:** [Ghost Stories of an Antiquary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1556093.Ghost_Stories_of_an_Antiquary) by M.R. James

* James may be the archetypal English ghost story writer — a Cambridge professor who wrote about over-curious scholars getting themselves into supernatural predicaments, some more deadly than others. But his work isn’t entirely as stuffy as that suggests. His strengths lie in building an eerie atmosphere and making the spirits that populate it seem malevolent and alien to the living world.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: occult powers, ruins, vengeful ghosts*

**Magical realism or literary fantasy:** [Fever Dream](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30763882-fever-dream) by Samanta Schweblin (translated by Megan McDowell) (HM)

* A strange conversation forces a woman in the hospital to consider dangers everyone tends to overlook. I was pulled in by the experimental style and impressed by this novella. Not necessarily speculative fiction (as you might expect from the English translation’s title), but fantastical elements add to the sense of uncertainty and unease.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: hidden threats, isolation, failure to protect your loved ones*

**Young adult:** [Beholder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61779957-beholder) by Ryan La Sala (HM)

* I don’t read much YA and considered swapping out this square, but eventually picked this up as an audiobook for a road trip. It passed the time with a fairly typical “disrupt the cosmic horror ritual” plot and romance. The specificity of the magic powers involved felt a little silly, but that’s probably a “not the target audience” issue.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: intrusive thoughts, survivor’s guilt, spiders, rich people*

# Row 2

**Mundane jobs:** [The Cipher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341930.The_Cipher) by Kathe Koja

* This is a divisive cult classic that ended up really working for me. Although it’s not the most intense in terms of fictional violence, I felt more dread while reading it than any other book on my card (in a good way). Koja creates an oppressively dark and grimy atmosphere with nowhere for her characters to go but down.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: body horror, lack of direction, destructive relationships, unusual bodily fluids*

**Published in the 2000s:** [My Death](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125053180-my-death) by Lisa Tuttle (HM)

* While I enjoyed it, I have to admit this short novella isn’t the best fit for a horror card. (I may or may not have given up midway through a Spanish-language story collection from the 2000s last week.) Lisa Tuttle has written in a range of genres, and *My Death*, which follows one author’s attempts to unravel the mysteries surrounding another, is especially hard to pin down. But there’s an air of strangeness that builds throughout the story, and I think it would appeal to weird fiction readers.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: coincidence, inexplicable events, unexpected familiarity*

**Angels and demons:** [Between Two Fires](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13543121-between-two-fires) by Christopher Buehlman

* I finally got around to this novel after seeing it recommended hundreds of times here. All right Reddit, credit where’s it’s due. This is very good medieval horror-fantasy, following its characters on a journey through a biblically apocalyptic landscape at the time of the Black Death. Grim and grotesque at points, but it leaves hope for redemption.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: desperation, corruption, demons both literal and metaphorical*

**Short stories:** [Revenge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16032127-revenge) by Yōko Ogawa (translated by Stephen Snyder) (HM)

* A collection of unsettling short stories that gradually intertwine — not, for the most part, focused on revenge, but dealing with a range of dark themes from the perspectives of grieving, adrift and alienated characters. I found Ogawa’s writing understated but gripping, with tension below the surface. Some of the stories have just a slight sense of the uncanny, while others tear off the veil.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: loss, hidden motives, festering resentments*

**Horror:** [Ring](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38379.Ring) by Kōji Suzuki (translated by Glynne Walley and Robert B. Rohmer) (HM)

* I read this novel before I watched the original movie. Based on what I’d heard about the series over the years, it surprised me that *Ring* was less focused on supernatural thrills than the more mundane work of investigating a mystery. The story kept me invested, but between the odious main characters — not necessarily a dealbreaker for me — and the occasionally weak editing/translation, I’d sooner recommend the movie.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: viruses, vengeance, self-perpetuating doom*

# Row 3

**Indie press (or self-pub):** [Crom Cruach](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62066401-crom-cruach) by Valkyrie Loughcrewe (from Tenebrous Press)

* I wanted to pick something for this square that highlighted the way small presses support unique and experimental horror, and this fit the bill: a horror story told in verse about a near-future Irish community confronting old horrors and political conflicts. There’s a large cast of characters, and some of them get a bit lost in the shuffle, but overall this was a really strong debut, gruesome and compelling.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: fascism, paranoia, the dead that won’t stay dead*

**Set in the Middle East:** [The Corpse Exhibition and Other Stories of Iraq](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114111-the-corpse-exhibition-and-other-stories-of-iraq) by Hassan Blasim (HM)

* This is a hard-hitting and blood-soaked collection of stories about Iraqi characters trapped in cycles in violence and madness. Though it’s not a genre work, a strong thread of the absurd and surreal runs through the book. I feel awkward trying to review it in the context of r/fantasy bingo, frankly, but it’s certainly worth reading.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: war, occupation, man’s inhumanity to man*

**Published in 2023:** [A Guest in the House](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61484875-a-guest-in-the-house) by Emily Carroll

* I loved both the art and writing in this graphic novel — recommended as long as you don’t mind some ambiguity in your horror. In fine Gothic tradition, it follows a woman who has recently married a widower and begun to have some doubts. But the nature of those doubts and the ways they manifest set this story apart.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: loneliness, hauntings, unfulfilled dreams*

**Multiverse:** [The Hellbound Heart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52635.The_Hellbound_Heart) by Clive Barker (HM)

* This novella puts Barker’s best-known themes on display — a monstrous pantheon, intermingling of sex and violence, and dangerous temptations. It’s nicely crafted, nasty and propulsive, with the human monsters more chilling than the inhuman ones. After reading this and *Cabal*, I’m looking forward to digging further into his work.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: obsession, lust for life, trying new things*

**POC author:** [Zone One](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10365343-zone-one) by Colson Whitehead

* I see this book has an unusually low Goodreads rating, and I’d guess that’s because it sits between genres — some literary readers might not like all the zombie killing, some zombie fans might not like all the slow-paced flashbacks and nihilistic pondering. Fortunately, I don’t mind either of those, and I thought this was great. Whitehead balances out his satire of human folly at the end of the world with enough detail to make it feel bleakly believable.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: the walking dead, the walking living, the American can-do spirit*

**Book club:** [The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41717668-classics-reimagined-the-strange-case-of-dr-jekyll-and-mr-hyde) by Robert Lewis Stephenson

* I finally got around to reading this Gothic classic, the mere concept of which utterly terrified me in kindergarten, and I’m glad I did. I found it interesting how it arrived at the horror indirectly, with a friend of Jekyll’s investigating his behavior. Even without the mystery element, it was a nicely tense buildup to the truth of his condition.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: man’s capacity for evil, the temptation to indulge it*

**Novella:** [You Should Have Left](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32855689-you-should-have-left) by Daniel Kehlmann (translated by Ross Benjamin) (HM)

* An epistolary novella that made good use of its short length in building some weirdness and tension, but which ultimately didn’t leave much of an impact on me. The characters felt pretty flat, and I couldn’t help but think of the story in reference to other works (*House of Leaves* lite, etc.).
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: relationships in crisis, reality in crisis, writing deadlines*

**Mythical beasts:** [Patricia Wants to Cuddle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59093587-patricia-wants-to-cuddle) by Samantha Allen (HM)

* I have mixed feelings about this book, though I don’t regret picking it up. On the whole, it was a pretty fun, quick, ultimately gory read satirizing reality TV (and society as a whole). Several complicating story threads added some depth and emotion to the slasher-ish plot, but didn’t completely come together for me in the end.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: isolated camping retreats, social media, late capitalism*

**Elemental magic:** [Silver Nitrate](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63249718-silver-nitrate) by Silvia Moreno-Garcia (HM)

* Moreno-Garcia has described this novel as a “supernatural thriller” rather than horror. Regardless of genre, it wasn’t a standout for me — while I liked the digressions into the history of Mexican horror cinema, a lot of the actual character development felt overly summarized. It still kept me engaged, and the elemental magic (different rituals are connected to the elements, nobody’s throwing around fireballs) was a nice surprise for bingo.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: Nazi occultism, past regrets, the magic of the movies*

**Myths and retellings:** [Six Tragedies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7931799-six-tragedies) by Seneca (translated by Emily Wilson)

* This book collects some Ancient Roman plays, all of which have earlier origins in Greek mythology and drama. So, obviously it isn’t horror. But … what if it was? What if I wasn’t in the mood for any modern horror retellings this year? More seriously, I found this an interesting read, and it made me think more about the ways the horror genre can echo the themes and methods of tragedy. Wilson notes in her introduction, “Seneca has a far stronger obsession than any Greek tragedian with the possibility that the whole universe may be at a point of crisis, and a far greater interest in transgression and in physical disgust.”
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: uncontrolled passions, collapse of social and family bonds*

# Row 5

**Queernorm:** [The Stars Are Legion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29090844-the-stars-are-legion) by Kameron Hurley

* I enjoyed the blend of genres in this novel. Ultimately it felt more like a sci-fi adventure than horror, but there were plenty of weird biological grotesqueries to shudder at along the way. It’s queernorm in the “different gender/sexuality norms than our world” sense, not the “perfectly unproblematic” sense. There’s no homophobia because the concept of maleness apparently doesn’t exist (for reasons that are gradually revealed — it’s far from a second-wave feminist utopia).
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: fleshy technology, loss of bodily autonomy, lack of trust*

**Coastal or island setting:** [The Devil and the Deep: Horror Stories of the Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36049101-the-devil-and-the-deep), edited by Ellen Datlow (HM)

* This anthology started out pretty uneven for me, but by the end I was glad I’d chosen it. Even the weaker stories added to the atmosphere of dread around the ocean’s depths. My favorites were “Fodder’s Jig” by Lee Thomas, “The Whalers Song” by Ray Cluley, “What My Mother Left Me” by Alyssa Wong, and “He Sings of Salt and Wormwood” by Brian Hodge.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: the sea, things lost in the sea, things hiding in the sea*

**Druids:** [The Old Gods Waken](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/939478.The_Old_Gods_Waken) by Manly Wade Wellman (HM)

* I didn’t find many on-theme options for this square, but this was fun enough in an old-fashioned pulp way. It had some repetitive writing and more highly educated characters lecturing about (dodgy, but not quite Lovecraftian) comparative anthropology than I expected from horror-fantasy set in backwoods Appalachia. I might check out Wellman’s short stories sometime, as I’ve seen them recommended more often than his novels.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: dark Druidic rituals, unfriendly neighbors (this one was pretty light on the horror, really)*

**Robots:** [The Scourge Between Stars](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784410-the-scourge-between-stars) by Ness Brown

* This was a mostly enjoyable work of spaceship action-horror with too many plot threads for its length and a setup that annoyed me more and more as the story unfolded. (Why would an entire crew shrug their shoulders about a captain gone incommunicado in his quarters?) I’d try future works by the author, but wouldn’t recommend this broadly unless you’re really craving something in the *Alien* vein.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: the void of space and what may lurk there, family secrets*

**Sequel:** [Don’t Fear the Reaper](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59366246-don-t-fear-the-reaper) by Stephen Graham Jones

* The second book in the Indian Lake trilogy, this continues the pastiche of slasher movies and focuses on returning characters reckoning with their respective traumas (and creating new ones). I found it a little less engaging than the first book — it felt more convoluted to me, with some time spent waiting for certain shoes to drop. But I’m still looking forward to reading the final installment.
* *What’s horrifying/terrifying/weird/uncanny: slashers, creeps, returning home*

# Bonus miscellaneous card

You may have noticed that I read more novellas and comics than recommended for bingo. I tried to compensate for that by completing a [second, unthemed bingo card](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFvXpJ7P5Y/SQoMqe8xUuzWfKhpnsoz2w/view?utm_content=DAFvXpJ7P5Y&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor), which also ended up with a large share of short books. At least together, they should make a full card.

I don’t think my second card is really worth its own post, so here are a few highlights:

* Fantasy favorites: *Tales from Earthsea* by Ursula K. Le Guin was unsurprisingly great. *A Stranger in Olondria* by Sofia Samatar and *The Alchemy of Stone* by Ekaterina Sedia both impressed me as beautifully written, contemplative fantasy with characters caught up in political events beyond their control. I’m also glad one of the r/fantasy book clubs introduced me to *The Last Dragoners of Bowbazar* by Indra Das, which was more of a character study reflecting on family, memory and being stuck between worlds.
* Sci-fi favorites: I didn’t read much science fiction for this card, but I’d recommend both *The Body Scout* by Lincoln Michel and *Titanium Noir* by Nick Harkaway to enjoyers of cyberpunk and near-future mysteries. I especially liked *The Body Scout*, which had an over-the-top setting and a bumbling loser detective (what can I say, that’s often a plus for me).
* Least favorite: Definitely *The Ten Thousand Doors of January*. I read it for a book club, and it just felt twee and contrived compared to books I’ve loved with similar themes. The *Lucifer* comics also didn’t capture my interest enough to read on in the series. But otherwise, I was pretty happy with my choices.

Happy to answer questions about any of these books. Just be prepared for either an essay or a shrug if you ask which ones are “actually scary.”",Fantasy

1711543183.0,First Time Bingo Reviews 4/5,"16. Book club book- The Raven and The Reindeer by T. Kingfisher 3.5/5 B


This was a pleasant fairytale about a girl going to save the ass of a boy she loves from his somewhat willing imprisonment by an evil spirit. It was entertaining. It wasn’t very deep in any sense of the word. I thought the romantic subplot was good if, again, not necessarily deep, but I also don’t think it needed to be. I really enjoyed the main character coming to appreciate herself and it is nice, after so much recent moral grey, to just have a good person as an MC. I have to say though; her grandmother is a terrible parent. Who the hell sends their naive 16 year old granddaughter, who has never left her small town, to a mythically far away place to fight essentially an incredibly powerful demon and all she says is, “I won’t stop you. Don’t forget your boots.” Either Gerta should have had to sneak away or the author should have explained why the MC’s grandmother wanted her to die, because that’s the only reasonable expectation for what would happen. Anyways, if you like fairytales you might like this one. It reads a bit more like a classic straightforward fable with some more modern touches. I’d say it was targeted at a middle school girl demographic (not in a bad way). The relationship dynamic between Gerta (MC) and Kay (boy she journeys to rescue) felt painfully reminiscent of middle school girls being more emotionally mature, obsessing over perceived signals, and being infatuated with a somewhat manipulative, selfish, and semi-oblivious boy (though there is a scene with her kissing with a hand on her breast so a bit more pg13). I personally didn’t really feel strongly for or against this one, but I thought the author probably about hit their mark.



17. Novella not from tordotcom- Slow Regard For Silent Things by Patrick Rothfuss. 5/5 S


 And on the third day, Auri made soap or something…and I was absolutely riveted. This novella largely follows the daily life of a very strange girl in her home in the ruins beneath a magic university. It reminded me of why I loved The Name of The Wind more than A Wise Man’s fear. Both this novella and Name of The Wind have a strong dash of survivalism. This novella is closer to the usual survival against your environment, whereas in The Name of The Wind he survives poverty that doesn’t feel contrived (a lot of events felt contrived to me in Wise Man’s Fear). I think this is an underused subgenre, but one that can only be pulled off by certain writers. His prose is fantastic as always. Auri is really bizarre and otherworldly yet completely somehow relatable. I find Patrick Rothfuss to be a writer with both exceptional strengths and glaring flaws. This just really plays to Rothfuss’ strengths (prose, excellent side characters, mystery) without getting bogged down by his weaknesses (plot, character development). I don’t think this is for everyone, but man did I love it. Side note, I’d give The Narrow Road Between Desires a 3.5/5 B. It was a neat little dark fairy tale, but nothing standout in prose or storytelling though I did like the set up of Bast trading secrets with children at the lightning tree and it does have some really wonderful and tender moments near the end. Amazingly, given the length of this novella, I still felt like there was a decent amount of unnecessary fluff. I honestly wish this would have just been a completely different cast of characters though, some other fae in a small town. It just made Bast feel less mysterious and alien to me and the other characters felt like mere cameos. I don’t know, underwhelmed would be my main takeaway particularly in comparison with Slow Regard. 



18. Mythical beast not dragon- The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle. 3/5 B


This one was a difficult one to review objectively (to the degree anyone can be objective) as I subjectively strongly disliked it which I realize is very much a minority opinion. This is a meandering fairytale about a unicorn overhearing she may be the last of her kind, seeking to find if this is true, and getting sucked into a fairy tale (repeatedly saying “we’re in a fairy tale”). I can see some of why people love this book. He has some evocative, if flowery, imagery and I think some people love fairy tale structures more than others. I found the imagery initially impressive, “hot damn” impressive. I would place his character descriptions in the realm of Gene Wolfe even if I still think Gene’s are better. However, as the book progresses, the imagery becomes progressively tiresome and unnecessary. It got to a point where I found myself thinking, “Can’t someone for once just do something without some grandiose description?” No. One does not simply walk in this book. Unfortunately, his imagery was also about the only good thing I found in it. I found the underlying plot thoroughly uninteresting. Not bad necessarily, just deeply uninteresting. I just didn’t find anything to make me care about it or any of the characters one bit, the unicorn most of all (though I did like the circus scene). Writing this now, I can’t think of any character more utterly and completely lacking of a personality than the unicorn who spends the majority of the book either whining or just kinda there, while other characters (especially Molly Grue) tell you how special it is. I really don’t like being told repeatedly that something is special when the author did nothing other than an initial character description to make me agree. It’s not just that this was intended for a younger audience either. Watership Down could easily make me cry as an adult who rarely cries from books. In fact, children’s books often do a pretty darn good job at emotional connection. In this book, I found none of the characters particularly deep, endearing, or compelling. For it to work, I needed to be a little invested in the characters or at least the main goal. A few times, I found myself thinking that I would be totally fine if this was indeed the last unicorn. I think there was some attempts at humor with some breaking the fourth wall “we’re in a fairy tale. This is how fairy tales go.” Or a character inexplicably reading a magazine, but I didn’t find them all that funny or really fitting with the rest of the book as it wasn’t really a goofy comedy where this kind of humor works (It was no toll booth in the desert from Blazing Saddles). I do think for aspiring writers though, descriptions like the unicorn’s initial description or the witch’s are good enough to study. I’d recommend it for lovers of flowery imagery or fairy tales, but otherwise I wouldn’t recommend this book. Still, as I said, I find this one very difficult to try to objectively rate and I am very much in the minority for disliking it so I suspect it’s more subjective. 



19. Elemental magic- Sword of Kaigen M.L. Wang 4/5 A


Japan, aka the water nation, is at war with the wind nation and a mother must rediscover her independent fighting skills and spirit to prepare her son and re-examine her relationship with her emotionally distant husband she dutifully buried her dreams to marry. This book was a rough-cut gem. I was not expecting to like it as much as I did. It feels a bit like a YA book and mature, adult book mashed together, but in a way that surprisingly did not bother me. It’s more of a character-driven family drama than the action I was expecting, though the action is still plenty fun. My main gripe is an amateur superhero flashback that felt disjointed from the rest of the book though I understand its purpose. The magic system is a bloodline, elemental magic system mixed with kung-fu school secret techniques. Think Naruto meets Avatar. Not original, but well executed and satisfying. It definitely has some flaws, could have used some polishing, and I think would have benefited from the editing process of traditional publishing, but definitely worth a read particularly if you enjoy character-driven stories. Side note; I am beginning to love old people and middle-aged mothers as characters. Please authors, give me more like this.


20.  Non Greek/Roman mythology- Thistlefoot by Genna Rose Nethercott. 4/5 A


I have to admit, I liked this book much more than I was expecting to. This book follows the descendants of Baba Yaga, a brother and sister raised in a traveling  puppet theater troupe, as they are reunited by the inheritance of their ancestor’s living house. The sister agrees to resurrect a popular act and tour with her vagabond brother for one year in exchange for the house that quiets her innate magic all the while pursued by The Longshadow Man leaving destruction in his wake. This was one of those mixed bag books for me. I really loved her prose that hit close to that sweet spot of simple with a dash of purple for me. Ditto for the two main characters. However, I found Isaac’s dialogue and Benji’s dialogue just unnatural and a little annoying and the band that feels like they were a DnD group of assembled characters with exceptional skills tailored to their task despite being…a band felt a bit contrived. As a whole, I felt the plot could have used a little polishing. There’s a romantic subplot that is sweet in a way, but also made me a bit uncomfortable. It’s not exactly incestuous, but it still feels wrong on some level. More than all this, why I didn’t rate a book higher despite really enjoying the characters and prose was this sense that it should be more. I really wish I could describe this better. There was so much in this book that felt almost great, but just not quite there—mostly in the plot I think. Still, I really enjoyed this book and love her general writing style. I would definitely read another book by her. The final telling of the house’s origin story made me cry and I almost never cry from books.",Fantasy
1711542650.0,Aromantic/Asexual Bingo: Hard Mode Only,"Last year, I did a bingo card with only books containing asexual and/or aromantic representation. I wasn’t sure if I could do it again, but I got some ideas after seeing this years card, so I decided to go for it. Because I like to make my life harder than it needs to be, this year I also did all hard mode. So here are my reviews; I hope somebody finds them helpful. I’m ordering roughly based on quality of representation. I tended to prioritize by how relevant a character being a-spec was to the story as well as avoiding harmful tropes/stereotypes. These are only my opinions though–other a-spec people might disagree!

You can find my a-spec themed card from last year [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/125qkj1/asexualaromantic_fantasy_bingo/). Also, u/recchai did two(!) a-spec cards this year, so I would recommend checking out their [wrap up post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1b4qrxk/2023_asexual_and_aromantic_two_card_bingo/) as well. 

# Helpful definitions/abbreviations:

* Ace/asexual: someone who experiences little to no sexual attraction
* Aro/aromantic: someone who experiences little to no romantic attraction
* Allo/allosexual: someone who experiences sexual attraction the typical way
* Alloro/alloromantic: Someone who experiences romantic attraction the typical way
* Ace-spec: on the asexual spectrum; someone who relates the asexual experience more than the allosexual one
* Aro-spec: on the aromantic spectrum; someone who relates the aromantic experience more than the alloromantic one
* A-spec: anyone on the asexual or aromantic spectrums
* Demi(sexual/romantic): someone who experiences (sexual/romantic) attraction only after a bond has formed with a specific person. Ie no crushes or immediate sexual attraction.
* Grey(sexual/romantic): someone who rarely experiences (sexual/romantic) attraction
* Aro ace: aromantic asexual
* Aro allo: allosexual aromantic
* QPR/queer platonic relationship: a certain type of relationship common in a-spec spaces that isn’t romantic but isn’t the way society typically views platonic relationships/friendships either. One common example is a friendship that has the same level of commitment as a romantic relationship (such as permanently living or raising children together). There’s lots more varieties of QPRs than that.

Let me know if you have any other terminology questions! I tried not to include too much jargon, but it’s really hard to talk about some of these without it.

# Rules:

All books must include some sort of a-spec representation. Characters who have a-spec traits due to their non-human nature (ie Murderbot from Murderbot Diaries) or magic (ie Tarma from Vows and Honor) do not count. Neither do head cannons (characters whose sexualities are up for debate). Characters who are confirmed to be a-spec by the author but with no textual evidence (ie Keladry from Protector of the Small) do not count. So every character must be confirmed by the words asexual, aromantic, ace, aro, etc being used or must be described as having an a-spec experience (so even something as vague as “not liking people that way” or “not interested in sex/romance” count).

# Reviews:

 **Myths/Retellings:** *The Ice Princess's Fair Illusion* by Dove Cooper

* Summary: A verse novel King Thrushbeard retelling, but with a-spec characters
* Representation: lesbian ace and aro ace main characters. Generally a really great job exploring the asexual spectrum. There was a lot of discussion about certain a-spec topics—such as the importance of labels, how QPRs work, and how sex-repulsion can manifest. I really liked how changing the character’s orientations changed the motivations and personalities of the leads from being kind of gross (in the original story) to something more wholesome without changing any major plot elements. Unfortunately the representation did lead to going off on tangents at times.
* Review: The verse novel aspect didn’t really work for me here. The story was told as a conversation between the two leads, and poetry just doesn’t feel like natural dialogue. Also, there were too many tangents and skimming over story beats. I think the retelling bit worked very well though.

**Published in 2023:** *The Meister of Decimen City* by Brenna Raney

* Summary: A quasi-supervillain had to deal with being under government surveillance, taking care of her sentient dinosaur children, and stopping her much more evil twin brother. 
* Representation: questioning greyromantic ace main character, This one had a more classic “realizing I’m ace” plot line, but it was well executed. I really liked seeing a sexually active/sex indifferent ace character, those are pretty rare. I’m not a huge fan of the ace evil genius trope, but this book did a way better job of it than Vengeful by VE Schwab.
* Review: I liked it. The zany superhero/supervillian stuff wasn't quite to my taste, but I really liked the nuanced depictions of trauma and messy family relationships.

**Self Published:** *Legacy of the Vermillion Blade* by Jay Tallsquall

* Summary: A classic fantasy story about a man’s struggle with an ancestral curse and finding his lost childhood love.
* Representation: gay ace main character, gay ace side character. This one did a great job portraying some common asexual experiences. I found it especially refreshing to read about a more masculine asexual character—those are very rare.
* Review:  I had a pretty good time. There was some parts of the pacing and tone that felt a bit off. I really liked the surprisingly healthy masculinity of the main character and also the importance of non-romantic bonds as well as romantic ones.

**Superheroes:** *Not Your Backup* by C.B. Lee (Book 3 in the Not Your Sidekick series)

* Summary: A girl and her friends team up against a corrupt superhero system while still dealing with some drama of teenage life.
* Representation: Questioning aro ace main character, aro ace side character. This one had a pretty solid subplot of the main character questioning if she’s aro ace and if she wants to turn the relationship she is in into a QPR. It was interesting to see a character who learned about asexuality and aromanticism in sex ed (imagine that!) but thought it didn’t apply to her reevaluate some of her assumptions while questioning.
* Review: This one was ok. I feel like the plot went on too many tangents, some of which felt pretty pointless. I do really like the diversity of this series though.

**Coastal/Island:** *At the Feet of the Sun* by Victoria Goddard

* Summary: A very successful bureaucrat starts a very eventful retirement.
* Representation: a-spec main character (probably gray-sexual). So this one could have been clearer about the difference between sexual and romantic attraction, I feel like that would really help make the representation more clear. On the other hand, >!the fanoa relationship between Cliopher and Fitzroy was so well executed! It ends up being very similar to a QPR. Seeing Cliopher’s doubts about ever being able to find this kind of relationship that works for him melt into happiness when he finally does was just so satisfying. Also, there was some really interesting commentary on how the Achilles and his pal/Sapho and her friend way of looking at historical or fictional relationships can get tricky and can leave out a-spec interpretations of those relationships.!<
* Review: This was a new favorite book for me! There is no plot besides some fairly random tangents, but the character writing was *so good*. 

 **Sequel:** *City of Deceit* by Claudie Arseneault

* Summary: Political fantasy book with a large cast where literally every character is queer in some form.
* Representation: aro ace, questioning demi-biromantic ace, heterosexual aro, questioning greysexual greyromantic, questioning demisexual.  I liked seeing the diversity of different a-spec experiences shown here and the interactions between a-spec characters. I’m curious to see where these characters will go in the fourth book in this series.
* Review: The political intrigue part of the book fell a bit flat, mostly because all the characters were way too idealistic. There were also some plot points that felt repetitive and not really needed.

 **Magical Realism (HM):** *The Bone People* by Keri Hulme:

* Summary: A lonely artist becomes friends with a Maori man and his non-verbal adopted son. (Content warning: child abuse)
* Representation: aro ace main character
* Published in 1984, this is the earliest a-spec representation I know of. It’s one of the best examples of someone who is a-spec but doesn’t have the words for it or have access to the a-spec community that I’ve read, which is no surprise because the author was in that exact position. I also liked the untraditional relationships that formed between characters. The downside was that a lot of concepts (sexual and romantic attraction, not wanting kids, being touch repulsed) were conflated.
* Review: This is definitely more literary than I am used to, and there were definitely a lot of nuances that I wasn’t able to pick apart, so of which I just didn’t have the cultural context for. I liked the Maori representation, but I think the child abuse in the book could have been handled better.

 **POC:** *The Circus Infinite* by Khan Wong

* Summary: A guy with gravity powers escapes being an experimental subject an abusive research institute and literally runs away to join a circus.
* Representation: Panromantic ace main character. This book has some interesting representation of an ace character dealing with being sex repulsed while being an empath and of the difficulties that come with being in an allo-ace romantic relationship.
* Review: This book was ok. The villains felt pretty cartoonish, but if you like the circus you might like it a lot more than me.

 **Queernorm setting:** *The Thread that Binds* by Cedar McCloud

* Summary: Three employees at a magic library become part of a found family and learn to cut toxic people out of their lives.
* Representation: aro ace and alloromantic ace main characters, greyromantic and demisexual demiromantic side characters. I liked that two of the main characters were casually in a QPR. It was fun to see an author write a queernormative setting that actually is ace/aro normative as well (most of the time queernorm means being normative to gay, lesbian, and bisexual people, sometimes trans people if you are lucky). It was also interesting to see how the main culture in this book not having any concept of gender didn’t change how people viewed a-spec identities but did change how they viewed other sexualities.
* Review: I really liked the worldbuilding and how cozy it was, although the stakes were a bit unclear. It was the first cozy fantasy book that I’ve read that really makes a point about the importance of cutting toxic people out of your life as well as gaining a found family.

 **Novella:** *Werecockroach* by Polenth Blake

* Summary: Three odd roommates, two of whom are werecockroaches, deal with an alien invasion.
* Representation: aro ace main character, a pretty much aro ace side character (who doesn’t use these labels though) The representation is brought up pretty casually here and isn’t a major focus. I still think it worked well.
* Review: It was so odd but it the best way. It was pretty low stakes with a bit of an anticlimactic ending, but I really liked following this group of characters. There was also representation of nonbinary, hard of hearing (tinnitus), and working class characters.

 **Mundane Jobs:** *Of Books and Paper Dragons* by Vaela Denarr and Micah Iannandrea

* Summary: Three introverts slowly become friends while being 
* Representation: alloromantic asexual main character (arguably a demi main character as well, it’s a bit ambiguous) This representation was somewhat similar to The Threads that Bind as a depiction of a mostly genderless queernorm society that is inclusive to a-spec people in general. The main difference is that this one did it by blurring the line between romantic and platonic relationships and it was also way less explicit about any particular identities.
* Review: I liked it. It very cozy and the lowest stakes book I’ve ever read, but it was fun to read about a bunch of introverts slowly becoming friends.

 **YA:** *The Fae Keeper* by H.E. Edgmon

* Summary: Wyatt struggles with dealing with discrimination, figuring out interpersonal relationships, and facing off with bigots in order to create a better fae society.
* Representation: homoromantic demisexual side character, biromantic asexual side character Unlike the first book in this series where representation was mentioned off hand, this one went the more informative route. There were some missed oppertunities of some things having to do with the a-spec characters (an ace character struggling to set boundaries in relationships but not relating that to their sexuality), but I did like the focus on different types of relationships.
* Review: This is an aggressively Gen Z book, which worked for me, but I can see this bothering others. I liked the focus on systematic discrimination and systematic change, even if sometimes the answers felt a little simplistic. There was still a bit too much romance for me, but at least it was balanced out somewhat by some of the other relationship types. 

 **SWANA/Middle East (HM):** *The Bruising of Qilwa* by Naseem Jamnia

* Summary: The main character has to balance their responsibilities as a healing trainee, a refugee, an older sibling, and a teacher.  
* Representation: aro ace main character. The main character is shown to be asexual and aromantic, but each is only really mentioned in a single line.
* Review: I liked the setting and the ideas behind this novella, I just feel like there was too many ideas in too few pages. There’s a lot that I think could have been fleshed out more. Also, the time jumps did not help the pacing. 

 **Bookclub/Readalong:** *In the Lives of Puppets* by TJ Klune

* Summary: A human in a world full of robots rescues an android.
* Representation: gay ace main character. I think this one does a pretty good job explaining the basics of asexuality, which would probably be helpful for an allo audience. I thought this premise would be a good opportunity to talk about why asexual people are often seen as “robotic”/why robots are coded as asexual, but this book just didn’t engage much with any of that. I didn’t get much out of it, personally.
* Review: This wasn’t my favorite. I wasn’t a huge fan of how TJ Klune handled the themes of this story, and there were also a few inconsistencies with the worldbuilding I found pretty weird. It was also a bit too sweet, but in a slightly preachy way? It’s hard to describe.

 **Elemental Magic:** *A Dance of Water and Air* by Antonia Aquiline

* Summary: A prince is engaged to marry the queen of a neighboring country for political reasons, but he starts falling in love with her brother instead.
* Representation: demisexual (and possibly demiromantic?) main character. It was mentioned a couple of times and was definitely pretty clear about it. It didn’t do anything creative with it though. I think I would have appreciated it if we saw more of these characters becoming friends instead of speeding through the time they got to know each other.
* Review: I didn’t like it, but I also don’t like romance, so no surprise there. I’m in no way qualified to judge what makes for a good fantasy romance book. 

 **Bottom of the TBR (HM)**: *Sufficiently Advanced Magic* by Andrew Rowe

* Summary: A boy goes to school to learn magic and gets caught up in a mysterious plot.
* Representation alloromantic ace main character. It was mentioned, but it wasn’t too big of a focus in this book. I don’t think that there was anything really new for me in the representation in this book. It’s cool to see a progression fantasy book though—not many ace characters fit into that subgenre.
* Review: This wasn’t my favorite. I found it to info dump too much and the pacing to be too slow for me personally. 

**Robots (HM):** *This Golden Flame* by Emily Victoria:

* Summary: A girl in a Greek inspired setting teams up with an automation to find her brother and freedom.
* Representation: aro ace main character (the girl, the automation is the other mc). It was mentioned a couple of times, but wasn’t a major focus. I liked the emphasis on friendship.
* Review: This was a bit too YA for me. There were some plot bits that felt a bit too convenient. I liked the way magic was used to make automations though.

 **Druids:** *Of the Wild* by E. Wambheim

* Summary: A forest spirit rescues and cares for abused children.
* Representation: gay ace main character. It wasn’t a huge factor in this book, just mentioned a couple of times. This has a non-human ace lead, but it was never implied that being non-human was the cause of him being asexual, so I counted it. Also, it was really fun to see an ace character in a parental role.
* Review: I really liked this one—it ended up being wholesome and comforting. I loved the emphasis on parental love, and I thought that the themes were well handled.

 **Published in the 00s:** *The King's Peace* by Jo Walton

* Summary: A thinly disguised King Arthur retelling from the perspective of basically a female asexual version of Lancelot.
* Representation: aromantic? asexual main character. It came up a couple of times, mostly in regards to the MC not wanting to get married and also her being raped, which happens right at the start of the book. It generally tried to make it clear that being raped did not make her asexual, but I think that the book could have gone a little bit more into that intersection. 
* Review: This one didn’t quite work for me. There were too many people and places that I had difficulty caring about or keeping track of, and the plot would get interrupted by stretches of not much happening.

**Title with a Title**: *Redemptor* by Jordan Ifueko

* Summary: Tarisai has to deal with her empire’s nobles, evil beings from the underworld, and her own mental health.
* Representation: biromantic ace side character. This is the sequel to Raybearer, which I read last year, and it generally was an improvement in terms of representation. Dayo was significantly less infantilized. It generally had some good (if relatively basic) discussions in regard to asexuality, but there was one thing I thought was not handled super well. It was still cool to see an African inspired ace male character.
* Review: It was ok. I liked how the themes in this one were handled most of the time. There was a love triangle that annoyed me, and the plot was pretty fragmented. 

**Multiverse:** *An Accident of Stars* by Foz Meadows

* Summary: A girl accidentally crosses into a fantasy world, meets new people, and gets involved in a rebellion.
* Representation: bisexual aromantic side character. It was only mentioned a couple of times, so it wasn’t a big focus. It was cool to see a Black middle-aged polyamorous aro allo character though.
* Review: It was pretty decent. It was a bit slowly paced and the ending was anticlimactic for me, but I liked the setting and the way several characters were written.

**Mythical Beasts :** *Our Bloody Pearl* by D.N. Bryn

* Summary: A pirate rescues a siren from an abusive situation and helps them heal.
* Representation: alloromantic asexual side character. It wasn’t a huge focus but just kind of mentioned at the end. It also touches on that character being sexually abused on a child, and personally, I would have liked it more if the intersectionality of being aseuxal and a survivor of sexual abuse was dealt with in more depth instead of being brushed over a bit.
* Review: This was too romance heavy for me personally. There’s a mix of both action heavy and more thoughtful healing moments, which clashed sometimes but worked surprisingly well at others.

**Angels and Demons:** *Dust* by Elizabeth Bear

* Summary: A girl who got captured by an enemy faction must escape and find a way to save the multi-generational starship they are all on.
* Representation: Homoromantic? ace MC. This one just barely qualified as representation. There was a lot of conflation between the main character not having sexual desires and choosing to be celibate (as a married to the job type knight), which isn’t how asexuality works, generally. Also, the nanobots inside the main character can change her sexuality, which also confuses things a bit. That being said, trying to change the main character’s asexuality was explicitly described as a very bad thing, which was nice to see especially in this old of a book.
* Review: The world building in this book was so cool—it mixed a scifi multigenerational spaceship with AIs and nanobots with fantasy ideas such as knights, princesses, and swords as well as religious elements like angels and biblical stories. It really helped make the world feel unique. On the other hand, there was some >!unnecessary incest (thankfully not sexually graphic)!< that was grossing me out. 

 **Horror** **(HM):** *The Magnus Archives* written by Jonathan Sims (especially Season 3)

* Summary: This is a horror podcast/audio drama about an archivist who records statements of creepy supernatural encounters on tapes. There’s connections between the statements that feed into an overarching plot. 
* Representation: Biromantic ace MC. There’s like a two sentences that implies that the MC is ace in season 3 (episode 106), so it’s not really that relevant, which is why it’s so low. On the other hand, Jon is one of the few ace characters that actually has a presence in a fandom that seems to mostly know he’s ace, so that’s cool.
* Review: Honestly, this was really fun. I didn’t think I liked horror, but this podcast really worked for me. There was a good mix of creepy statements (equivalent to short stories) and overarching plot and character development. The voice acting was also good. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this for ace representation alone, but if you’re listening to it anyway, it’s not a bad choice.

# Conclusions

Similar to last year, I’d like to reiterate that plenty of a-spec representation exists in SFF books (I mean, I could manage to pull off two entire bingo cards!), despite what the common perception is both inside and outside the a-spec community. I think people don’t see much in mainstream books, say we have none, and then don’t look for less mainstream examples (especial indie and self published ones). I hope that we can break this cycle, especially since a lot of the best/most creative representation I read was in indie/self published books. 

Also, it was generally harder to find aromantic representation than asexual representation. There were just way more online lists for ace representation than aro ones. Even books that contain aro ace characters were commonly only acknowledged as having asexual representation, not aromantic representation. Allo aro characters were particularly hard—but not impossible—to find.

If anyone had any questions about asexuality or aromanticism, I will do my best to answer them! I would also be happy to see if anyone had more recommendations for a-spec characters, thoughts about the tropes used in representation, or comments about representation in general. I can also give more targeted recommendations for anyone looking for a specific type of a-spec representation. If anyone read one of these books and feels differently (or the same) about it, I’d love to discuss it. I have more thoughts than I can fit in this post.

Thanks for reading, I know this was a long post!",Fantasy

**Bookclub: The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet by Becky Chambers**

This one was a surprisingly delightful story about a crew of a spaceship called the Wayfarer in the fair distant future, where many species have allied. Humans are not a powerful or dominant species, but accepted. Space travel is done via a process called tunneling, in which tunnels in the space time continuum are made. The Wayfarer is a ship that makes these tunnels, who get a contract to a distant planet of species newly invited into the galactic community. It’s a character driven story about the crew forming relationships, discovering each other’s secrets, dealing with the problems of space travel and interacting with other alien cultures. I’ve heard some people describe it as quiet, which I don’t agree with as they certainly hit a lot of problems along the way. Not recommended for people who need plot driven stories as this one was more multiple short vignettes along the way to their destination but heartily recommended for those who like science fiction, intricate worldbuilding and heavy characterization.

**Novella:  Demon's Daughter by Lois McMaster Bujold**

A nice novella in the ongoing saga of Penric, temple sorcerer, and his demon Desdemona. In the world of the Five Gods sorcerers are created when demons jump into people as they cannot exist unless sustained by the flesh of their mounts. They mentally imprint on the people and creatures they jump in. Getting a demon is no guarantee of being a sorcerer as not all demons and not all people are suited to sorcerer, and making sure all sorcerers are suitable is a major role of the temple. In this one we get to see the problems when a demon so newborn it knows nothing jumps into a six year old girl. Otta is an engaging child protagonist coming to terms with her new gift and life to help new readers, as well as the horrors she experienced receiving it, and returning fans get to enjoy seeing Penric and his extended family continuing to live happy, productive lives. A new reader can jump right into this story, although I would recommend starting earlier simply because Penric and Desdemona is a delightful series.

**Mythical Beasts: Dark Currents by Jacqueline Carey**

A nice little urban fantasy. Daisy is a half human half demon woman living in a tourist town which has a thriving community of creatures from myth living there. In this one alone there are naiads, fairies, a mermaid, an ogre, frost giants, vampires, werewolves, ghouls and a bunch more, some full-fledged major characters. She is also Hel’s Liaison (that’s Hel as in the Nordic Underworld goddess), attached to the police office to be the Liaison between the human and supernatural world. The plot involves her investigating the drowning of a college boy who appears to have been murdered by magical means and the tensions it creates between the supernatural and human community. I am lukewarm on the interpersonal issues Daisy has in her private life (three potential love interests is excessive and she did not handle friendship and secret keeping well) but it was a solidly told tale setting up future conflict I am interested enough in to want to read the rest of. The conflict between keeping her humanity and claiming her demonic birthright which could potentially bring Armageddon is the one which fascinates me most. 

&#x200B;

**Elemental Magic: Enna Burning by Shannon Hale**  

Sequel to The Goose Girl but this time the protagonist is Enna, the Princess’s friend. After acquiring the power of fire speaking when her country is invaded, she has several difficult choices to make about how and if she will use her gift. I didn’t like this one quite as much as the first The Goose Girl was about a protagonist going from weakness to strength, whereas Enna has to make a few stupid decisions and be careless with her friends and lover for the sake of the plot. They weren’t annoying dealbreakers for me though as the harsh realities of war, grief and desire to protect (all things that negatively impact good decision making) were exquisitely written. In this book the dangers of acquiring the power of nature speech is also shown, in a way it wasn’t in the last. They are classified as Young Adult but I do recommend Hale’s Bayern books for all ages.

**Myths and Retellings:**  **A Wolf at the Door and Other Retold Fairy Tales by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling**

I was excited to find this as Datlow and Windling have collaborated on excellent anthologies of retold dark fairy tales for adults before. This one was a a surprise as it was actually for children. 

The Months of Manhattan by Delia Sherman: A retelling of Toads and Diamonds with two ten year old stepsisters set in modern New York, but evil stepsister learns and becomes a better person in this version.

Cinder Elephant by Jane Yolen: Amusing snack of a tale written because the author hated Disney’s Cinderella, especially the birds.

Instructions by Neil Gaiman: A whimsical prose poem about what to do if you get trapped in a fairy tale he later turned into an illustrated book. 

Mrs Big: Jack and the Beanstalk Retold by Michael Cadnum: A retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk from the point of view of the giant’s loving if exasperated and exasperating wife, with more emphasis on the mysterious peddler. 

Falada: The Goose Girl by Nancy Farmer: My favourite, Falada is a fairy horse charged with bringing the Princess to her betrothal as punishment for tossing Conrad in the rosebushes. The usurping Princess gets a happy ending I found hilarious and delightful in this one, and Falada survives. 

A Wolf at the Door by Tanith Lee: A girl and her father foolishly invited a slob of a wolf into their house, but is he what he seems? And if he isn’t, is the price of saving him worth paying? Another favourite for its humour and post-apocalyptic setting.

Ali Baba and the Forty Aliens by Janeen Web: An Italian-Australian boy who enjoys exploring the abandoned gold mines comes across some aliens and loses his brother. Focuses on the trauma of losing a brother more than the original fairy tale, even if Al does find his life improved after he’s gone. 

Swans by Kelly Link: A modern day take on the story of the Princess who needs to save her brothers by weaving shirts of nettles. I liked this one greatly as the stepmother isn’t turning people into swans on purpose and there is a better explanation than the original, and while the Princess in this tale has bigger problems than beswanned brothers, she is also clever and practical enough to know how to solve them. 

The Kingdom of Melting Glances by Katherine Vaz: In most versions of this tale, the girl’s Prince visits her in the form of a bird and is then torn apart when her wicked sisters put razors in her window. This girl doesn’t give a stuff about a Prince. She travels great miles and begs the Prince for her hummingbird. The hummingbird is her happily ever after. 

Hansel’s Eyes by Garth Nix: Would have been my favourite if I hadn’t had read it before. Another modern day take, where they are abandoned in a city, ensnared by a PS4 shop and risks the witch taking Hansel apart to sell his organs. 

Becoming Charise by Kathe Koje: A modern tale of the ugly duckling, except in this one the girl who feels like she doesn’t belong doesn’t turn into the swan, or get the learning and belonging she desires so desperately. What she gets is hope in her future and herself, as after all the ugly duckling was always swan and would have become a swan regardless of circumstances. 

The Seven Stage a Comeback by Gregory Maguire: A fascinating take on what the Seven Dwarves could have done after Snow White left them with the Prince told entirely through dialogue. At first you feel sympathy for the dwarves, then horror as their love turns to obsession before the happy ending. 

The Twelve Dancing Princesses by Patricia McKillip: An oddity in the book as it was an actual retelling of the fairy tale, rather than a modern take, but done beautifully with exquisite prose. ",Fantasy

The thing that brothers me the most is that so many fantasy/ grim dark fantasy will have a very patriarchal society where women are treated like shit, get SAed, have no rights and I'm honest over it. So many people give the argument of its accuracy for the time period. Like seriously? We can have complex magic system, dragons, people coming back from the dead but God forbid women are treated equally the world will stop.

Even thrillers will have a plot of the killer SA his victims or the woman in the book has some sort of substance abuse to make them an unreliable narrator.

Romance is no better understanding the guise of ""dark romance"" everything seems to fly the romantic love intrest tortured, SAed, stalked the MC but it's all hehehe because he's hot and had some trauma from his childhood that only the MC can fix *gag*.

1711518861.0,"Good, effective--not necessarily un-annoying--child characters in SFF","I finished reading Dreamsnake today (a sci-fantasy of sorts).

She was very competent and heroic and sympathetic without feeling like a little adult. On a totally different side, I really liked and had my heartstrings tugged by what are sometimes considered annoying child characters, Simon (from The Dragonbone Chair, he's more of a young adult after that) and Fitz from the Farseer trilogy. That's because their annoying parts seemed very very true to life, and their progressions were earned and could readily be tracked with their developing brains as well as their life experiences. I felt like a protective aunt toward them, even when they frustrated me.

What child characters do you find effective in speculative fiction, and why? How does the unique nature of the world being built affect that?

1711512914.0,"Review of Star Trek: Picard: Firewall by David Mack - AKA How Seven became a D&D Ranger (tag: scifi, queer, Trek)","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ocxey9efysqc1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77e600308b169f72e3bf0af8d09da9a4f97b83c2

Link: [https://beforewegoblog.com/review-star-trek-picard-firewall-by-david-mack/](https://beforewegoblog.com/review-star-trek-picard-firewall-by-david-mack/)

*Star Trek: Picard* is a controversial spin off in my circle  as it draws out very strong emotions from its viewers. Some people love  it, some people hate it, and some people’s feelings change between the  seasons. On my end, I think the Picard show was of varying quality but  came up with some of the best ideas the franchise ever had. Also, I  think that it has consistently produced some of the best novels that *Star Trek*  has ever produced. THE LAST BEST HOPE by Doctor Una McCormack and ROGUE  ELEMENTS by John Jackson Miller are two of my all time favorite Star  Trek novels ever. FIREWALL by David Mack is now up there as well.

The premise is that Seven of Nine has found herself adrift after the  ship’s return to the Alpha Quadrant. Starfleet has made the possibly  justifiable decision to exclude her from Starfleet based on the idea she  might be a danger. Which becomes considerably less justifiable when you  remember that if she could be remotely hacked or was going to taken  over by the Borg, would have probably happened during the show’s seven  year run. It becomes even more spiteful and prejudice-filled when you  find out they’ve also denied her Federation citizenship. Which doesn’t  actually prevent her from living there but exists purely to make her  feel unwelcome.

I wasn’t a big fan of “Ad Astra Per Aspera” from *Star Trek: Strange New Worlds*  because it depicted a Federation that was engaged in hate crimes and  ghetto-ization of a large chunk of its population in the Illyrians. I  like to believe in Roddenberry’s future, we may not be perfect but we’ve  moved past Nazi/Terran Empire behavior. I’m more inclined to accept  Seven’s treatment, though, because it is far more isolated and we see  pushback from Janeway and others. It’s also practiced only by a handful  of individuals in the Federation which, sadly, include people of power.

Anyway, Seven seeks to find herself by living on the fringes of  Federation society that are also pretty dystopian and seem capitalist  despite the fact they don’t have money. This is a pretty common issue in  many works, though, so I don’t mind. That’s when she’s offered a chance  to get her membership in the Federation and possible Starfleet  commission if she infiltrates an organization called the Fenris Rangers.

Like all prequels, the actual destination is less important than the  journey. There’s a lot of interesting character beats in this book like  Seven coming to terms her bisexuality and also analyzing the idea that  the Federation’s Romulan Rescue Plan resulted in a total collapse of  necessary humanitarian relief in other parts of the galaxy. It makes the  question to cut their losses after the destruction of Mars seem more  justified.

Some fans were offput by Seven’s attraction to women but I think it  results in some of the more interesting parts of the book. We also get a  relationship that is surprisingly drama free and one that I feel like  will resonate with queer reader. I really liked the character of Ellory  Kayd and hope she shows up in future *Star Trek* material. I  understand that David Mack envisioned her as played by Jessica Henwick  and I think that helped my mental picture a great deal.

The Fenris Rangers are actually given a backstory and we get a sense  of what they are, other than having a cool name and fighting crime.  Apparently, they were once a legitimate law enforcement/security company  (for lack of a better term) contracted to protect the Qiris Sector.  When the governments collapsed, they continued carrying out their jobs  of enforcing the law of the previous regimes. Frankly, Starfleet  labeling them vigilantes in that respect is a sign of Federation  arrogance as who else would qualify as a legitimate government in that  situation?

The villains of the book are also interesting because they’re some of  the vilest ones in Star Trek, up there with the Cardassians, but some  of the most easily understood too. General Kohgish and Erol Tazgül are  guilty of horrific crimes against sapience but their motives are both  believable as well as extremely petty. General Kohgish just wants to  make as much bank as humanly possible while Arastoo believes that he’s  able to keep the Romulans out of the Federation by making a buffer state  via any means necessary once the Neutral Zones collapses. I also  appreciate Erol isn’t a part of Section 31 as that would be the “easy”  way to do it. No, he’s just a guy who got fired for his extreme  politics.

Admiral Janeway gets something of an off kilter performance and why I  put this book as a 9.5/10 instead of a 10 out of 10. Well, that and  because I feel like some of the locations like Starfield are a little  too like capitalistic intolerant Earth than the Federation should be.  Basically, Janeway seems awfully naive throughout the book. She doesn’t  seem to understand how much pressure and prejudice Seven is getting or  that Starfleet’s opinion on the Rangers are wholly unjustified. I wonder  if those blinders are just something every Federation citizen has or  it’s because she wasn’t in the Dominion War and saw how fallible the  Federation’s leadership could be.

In conclusion, I find this to be a fantastic novel and one I really  enjoyed. Seven of Nine has always been one of my favorite characters in  Star Trek and this is a great bridge between her VOY and Picard  personas. I really liked the Fenris Rangers as a concept and hope they  eventually invite David Mack to do a sequel or perhaps even a series of  novels set between this one and Season One of Picard.",Fantasy
1711512815.0,Perfect book for my friend who hasn't read much.,"So I decided a while ago, back in January actually that my friend who does little to no recreational reading (he only reads the things his college classes tell him to read) that I would get him his first big epic fantasy novel for his birthday. I thought the most fitting choice was ""the name of the wind"" because it's pretty easy to read, not overly complicated or anything ya know. Now though, I'm starting to think it was the wrong choice because like I've stated he doesn't read a ton outside of assigned things and I'm afraid maybe it was too big a leap to assume he'd transition from assigned reading to reading a dense 700 and something page fantasy book for fun. Should I have gotten him something lighter? (I still haven't given him the book yet because we don't see each other too often)  

Edit: here are some of the things he's watched and played: elden ring, one piece, solo leveling, black clover, halo, grounded, the finals, outward, the elder scrolls games. There's more stuff I could probably think of but that's just to name a few.",Fantasy
1711509079.0,Another First Timer Bingo Card w/Mini Reviews,"First, the card, made amazingly in MS Paint because I'm high class like that: 

[The lil H indicates a Hard Mode Title](https://preview.redd.it/pjog0cxs0sqc1.png?width=1077&format=png&auto=webp&s=e651c1add17c31f4fd63d6c2f33b7420d5dacb46)

So, I'll say I find the idea of having a POC author be a box to check kind of off-putting, so I made an effort to read more than what I ""had"" to, and this card clocks in at \*almost\* 50% POC.  I'll try to better that this coming year.

**First Row**

**Title Within a Title:** *The Blacktongue Thief,*  Christopher Buehlman.  I don't have anything substantive to add to the mass of ink spilled about this book already.  I will say I haven't read proper epic fantasy in a few years and this got me back into it and was thoroughly enjoyable.  Nothing particularly new, but it's a solid effort.  The whaling sidetrack was better than it had any right to be.

**Superheroes:** *We Could be Heroes,* Mike Chen.  I loved the underlying premise--our intrepid hero wakes up with no memory of who he is or where he comes from, just a name on a sticky note and superpowers he has to quickly learn about.  Having a would-be supervillain as the protagonist is a pretty interesting choice, and the superheroine with an eerily similar backstory whom he meets and eventually allies with as they try to discover their hidden histories is possibly a more interesting character.  Ultimately, I didn't feel like the writing really lived up to the promise of the premise, but it's a pretty solid book and people who aren't as picky about prose probably won't have any issue.

**Bottom of the TBR:** *Kitty's House of Horrors,* Carrie Vaughn.  I don't have a physical bookstack, so I went into my ""wish list"" for my library's Overdrive site and picked the oldest book there that fit.  I really lost 90% of my interest in Kitty Norville after *Kitty and the Dead Man's Hand*, because a werewolf being scared by a conventional gun show just existing in the same hotel was a bit rich.  This book really came back strong, though.  There was some good tension here, and I'm curious where it will go in the future, but not so curious I'm out here lining up the rest of her books.  

**Magical Realism:** *People in my Neighborhood,* Hiromi Kawakami Really my bread-and-butter subgenre these days, as the rest of this card will make clear.  I fell in love with Kawakami's work with *Strange Weather in Tokyo*, which in spite of the floating woman on its cover isn't fantastical at all, but a rather sweet take on romance.  I was not entirely prepared for the magical realism in this story collection, but it's enjoyably done.  The stories are loosely connected in that they are all (obviously) set in the same neighborhood and feature some of the same characters here and there, but there's no through-story.  You have to be a fan of slow, subtle stories to like this, I think, but I am.

**Young Adult:** *Library of Souls*, Ransom Riggs.  I used to read Riggs' Mental Floss columns on the regular and read the first two books in this series when they came out.  The first was good, the second was middling, and this one is...a bit in the middle of the others, I guess.  The photos blended seamlessly in the first book, but here they really feel forced, and the whole thing is a bit convoluted and the deus ex machina that allows our protagonist and his heroine to have their happy ending was just painfully contrived.  I know Riggs eventually continued this past the intended conclusion in this novel, but I'm just going to pretend like it remained a trilogy.

**Second Row**

**Mundane Jobs:** *Legends and Lattes,* Travis Baldree.  Another super popular novel in this sub for which I have no substantial additional commentary.  The book is cozy and mildly amusing.  The characters are solid, if not particularly deep or original.  The way one of the central problems was handled was less than satisfying, but at least that one annoying guy >!got eaten.!<

**Published in the 00s:** *Monster*, A.  Lee Martinez.  Martinez is, I feel, one of the more underrated urban/modern fantasy authors out there.  Unfortunately, I am among the number not giving him enough respect, because while I love his books whenever I read them, I immediately forget about him as soon as I am finished.  This is a pretty good book about a girl in retail who finds out monsters really exist and are terrible customers, the titular pest control guy (his name really *is* Monster, because he is one), and the hijinks they get into.  It's basically a buddy comedy with a demon girlfriend and a bunch of small paranormal critters to kill.  Not deep, and ultimately forgettable.

**Angels and Demons:** *Comfort Me with Apples*, Catherynne M. Valente.  You know, I thought I might be screwing over my oldest daughter by giving her the middle name Catharine, but at least that's a legitimate variant of the name.  Not sure what Valente's mom was thinking.  But anyway.  This is lushly written, but just not that good.  It starts out like a retelling of a fairy tale, but you twig to what's being retold pretty quickly.  Now, I'm no biblical literalist, but honestly I find the whole >!what if God was evil and the angels were evil and Lilith was really just misunderstood!< thing to be overdone, so ultimately this was unsatisfying.  Beautiful writing, though.  I'm more and more a fan of short novels as I get older, because they have to be pared down so well, and you've got to work to get a lot of story in comparatively few pages.  Valente does that fantastically well, at least.  There's not a wasted word in the story; everything is placed just so.

**Five SFF Short Stories:** *Bliss Montage,* Ling Ma.  Someone on Reddit gave me *Severance* for a Secret Santa exchange a few years back and I absolutely loved it.  So I actually preordered this when I heard about it.  It was...not what I was hoping.  I think the first two stories featuring a character not just obviously based off the same person but with the same exact name was just too precious.  ""Office Hours"" was pretty enjoyable, though.

**Horror:** *How to Sell a Haunted House,* Grady Hendrix.  Hendrix always has such amazing sounding plots.  This was actually the third of his novels I've tried to read, and the first one I've completed.  (I've since also read *Horrorstor.*)  This book would have worked really well as a family drama.  As a horror novel, it missed the mark with me.  I guess not finding puppets or dolls remotely creepy means it's not my sort of novel.  This was my first experience with Hendrix's idea of a plot twist, and it was silly enough that I knew to expect it in *Horrorstor*, because it's just what he does.  I feel like this Bingo card is really a mess of ""competent, but not great"" novels.

 **Third Row Across:** 

**Self-Published OR Indie Publisher:** *White Trash Warlock,* David R. Slayton.  I was actually shocked to learn this is a ""real"", albeit indie publisher behind this novel and it wasn't just self-published.  It's awful.  It feels strongly of a middle class dude's idea of white trash, the love interest makes me really hope the author came up with him as an anime-obsessed teenager.  I'm not compelled to read anything else in this series.  Again, decent premise, but trash execution.

**Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF:** *Slipping*, Mohamed Kheir.  This category gave me fits because the first thing I read for it, *10 Minutes, 38 Seconds in this Strange World*, while technically at least magical realism because it was told from the point of view of a murdered woman, just didn't feel like it had enough of the fantastic in it.  This *did*, but barely.  It's a great little book, elegantly written, but the plot is kind of hard to tease out because of just how much jumping around there is.  Still, it's really beautiful.  Not for people who need a heavy fantastical element, or for people who prefer a linear narrative.  But if you're down with piecing things together, it's great.

**Published in 2023:**  *Lone Women*, Victor La Valle.  I loved this book.  He takes a little-known bit of American History--a couple of them, really, because it seems like no one knows about the small black enclaves of success like the one at the beginning of the book--and spins a compelling story out of it.  Sure, the bad guys are a bit cliche, but the heroine is interesting enough to make up for it  I've gone and added the rest of La Valle's novels to my wish list.

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities:** *The Possibilities*, Yael Goldstein-Love.  You cand tell by looking elsewhere at the card that this wasn't my first attempt at this square; I actually rearranged things so I could use it instead.  It's one of the two best books I've read in the last five years, and one of the top five best I've ever read as far as the writing itself goes.  I'm also very drawn to the plot, though I realize many won't be.  It's about a woman who almost loses her son in childbirth, and then he really does disappear, and, worse, everyone starts forgetting he existed at all.  She has to figure out her ability to move from one reality to the next before he disappears entirely.  Ultimately, it's a book about the power of motherhood and mother love, and I nearly cried because of how true it rang in discussing those things.  The author, apparently, is a therapist who specializes in the adjustment to new motherhood, and I'm guessing that's why she was able to capture that period so well.

**POC Author:** *Nothing but Blackened Teeth*, Cassandra Khaw.  If this had been any longer, I wouldn't have made it.  In fact, the only reason I read it was I needed something to fill this square and I couldn't think of anything else.  Of all the yokai you can base a novel about, why choose a jokester like an Ohaguru bettari, whose victims in folklore are simply embarrassed?  Add in a bunch of rich and self-centered ""friends"" who all hate each other, and I was really hoping everyone died at the end.  Alas, it was only >!the least annoying among them!<.

**Fourth Row:** 

**Book Club OR Readalong Book:** *The Crane Husband*, Kelly Barnhill.  Again, a concept much more interesting than the execution.  I'm not saying it was bad, just that I felt the most compelling parts of the underlying (in world) mythology were basically ignored.  The Spooky Evil Corporation isn't new enough or well enough done to be interesting, so I'm glad it was mostly background noise.  I really liked the main character, though, and the struggle here felt a lot more real than in some of the books I've read in the last year or so.

**Novella:** *The Aunt Who Wouldn't Die*, Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay.  I like this sort of story very much, where it's kept close in and deals almost wholly with women and their worlds.  The titular aunt is a bitch of a ghost, and the story of how Somlata is eventually able to work around her is compelling.  The romance of her daughter is a bit pat and well-trodden stuff, but on the whole it's enjoyable.  Kind of toeing the line for fantasy, to be honest, but I'll happily go with my library's categorization.

**Mythical Beasts:** *The Hidden,* Melanie Golding.  Oh, this was a good one.  I'm a sucker for a selkie story.  Obvious feminist undertones.  The intersecting triangles around the heroine, the questionable male love interest, the selkie and her daughter, and the heroine's mother make for a fascinating story, and ultimately it was almost all satisfying, except for the all-too-real ending for the daughter.  (No children are harmed in the book, don't worry there.)

**Elemental Magic**: *The Library of the Dead*, T. L. Huchu.  This feels to me strongly similar to the Rivers of London series, but better.  I was glad to find the elemental magic hidden in the novel, because I knew to begin with this was a square I'd struggle with since it's such a done trope.  But I like this protagonist, her innate powers, and the setting of a not-quite-now Edinburgh.  I had to stop myself from reading the sequel immediately so I could finish out the rest of my card.

**Myths and Retellings:** *Thornhedge*, T. Kingfisher.  I'm a sucker for Kingfisher's work since reading *The Hollow Places* last year.  I'm also a sucker for retellings of the Briar Rose story.  I almost burned my one reread on Jane Yolen's Holocaust-set *Briar Rose*, in fact, but went with this instead.  And I'm glad I did.  Toadling is a darling heroine, the knight is just different enough from the norm to make me read more about him, and the idea of >!protecting people from Sleeping Beauty rather than putting her to sleep as an act of evil is just enough of a twist to be satisfying.!<  I was even happy with the ending, because it's enough of a fairy tale to work.

**Fifth Row:**

**Queernorm Setting:** *Summer Sons****,*** Lee Mandelo.  I'm kind of pushing it calling this novel's setting Queernorm, since it's nominally our world, but for real within the scope of the novel it *was* Queernorm.  Again, we've got a good premise and so-so follow-through.  You can absolutely tell the author is an academic, because those bits of the novel, few as they were, were the only ones written with any sort of authority.  The car guy bits rang hollow at best but mostly false (I was really, really bothered that he just left his car sitting in the parking area of the impound lot with no way to get it back; car guys *don't do that*).  The characters felt like a checklist for representation rather than anything authentic.  The central mystery is too easily solved, the spooky ghost bits don't feel nearly explored enough, and basically nothing felt authentic.  It was OK, it was competent, but I really, really wanted it to be more than it was.  

**Coastal or Island Setting:** *The Hike*, Drew Magary.  Yes, this was initially my multiverse pick.  But it works as a coastal story, and they even go to sea.  This is a fascinating book, and interestingly contrasts with *The Possibilities* as there are strong similarities--in each case, a parent trying to get back to their family.  At some point this gets a bit ridiculous.  >!(Yes, the turning into a crab and going back to help himself.)!<  And it has a much more pat ending than *The Possibilities*.  But it's still a compelling, quick read, and all the many things he got up to in his alternate dimension were interesting circumstances.  There's never a real lull in the narrative here, which I appreciate.

**Druids:** *Iron and Magic,* Ilona Andrews.  I almost swapped this square out, because Druids bore me and it seems as though my library has ten thousand Kevin Hearne (whom I can't stand) books and maybe five others that might or might not have Druids, but I stumbled upon this at the last minute, and thank goodness for the ""or nature magic user"" bit because there's a druid who plays an important part in the narrative, but it's mostly the heroine's use of nature magic that qualifies this.  I do find Andrews's world compelling, and they write solidly competent paranormal romances when not writing solidly competent urban fantasy, but this isn't a great entry.  I know Enemies to Lovers is somehow the hot trope, but I'm not hugely fond of it, and it's pretty ham-handed here.  Oh, and it features the *worst* sex scene I've ever read that was not written by Diana Gabaldon.  But I just like Andrews's take on the tech/magic dichotomy so much.  Not sad to see they never got around to writing a sequel, though.

**Robots:** *High Noon on Proxima B*, ed. David Boop.  I am, admittedly, stretching with this one.  But there are just enough stories that heavily feature robots and one or two more with androids.  Sadly, only the first story had a robot protagonist.  And that was a fantastic story that gave me high hopes for the rest.  But they were mostly just good enough to keep reading.  There is, of course, an Evil Corporation or three, but mostly they're handled well, and a couple of the stories (I did not take notes on titles, as I should have) are amusing enough even if nothing lives up to that initial promise.

**Sequel:** *Amongst Our Weapons*, Ben Aaronovitch.  I feel like the Rivers of London series has weakened a bit since the initial antagonist was defeated enough to be run offscreen.  But I'll admit it was exciting to find Bev pregnant with twins around the same time I found I was pregnant with twins.  I only just got around to this book, though.  I'll freely admit I don't recall a whole hell of a lot about it aside from their birth at the end and how jealous I was of the sheer beauty of the whole thing.  The silver mystery felt like they were building up yet more mythology far past what I can bring myself to care about.  I will say I appreciate Aaronovitch's ability to give Grant a very clear voice as narrator.  These books are easier for me on my Kindle app where I can stop & Google unfamiliar architectural terms.

1711507863.0,Audiobook like a Tarantino movie (for reference I loved the First Law Trilogy),"Hello fantastic people of reddit! Could there be a man or woman in the cyber- space we share, who would be willing to suggest a GREAT audio book that will incapsulate me in a characters blood and bones, while not being a drama!!!! Many characters, even many plots are very fine. Please something exciting!!",Fantasy
1711504060.0,More 2023 Bingo Mini Reviews!,"I finished all of these books months ago and have been procrastinating making this post, but I have my 2023 reading journal in front of me so let's get started! [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/onzVLE2) my card for a visual aid.

**Title with a Title: LEGENDBORN by Tracy Deonn, 4/5-** I have to admit, this was a little bit of a letdown because this book had been so hyped up for me. So here, let me help your expectations--this is a very YA YA book, perfect for teens but a bit harder connect to as an adult. (Which is perfectly fine! YA is *for* teens!) It's well written with interesting characters; for me it was slow until around 60% in, and then I couldn't put it down. However, I don't know if I'll be continuing after BLOODMARKED, because I never got sucked into that one. LEGENDBORN is definitely the better book.

**Superheroes: STEELHEART by Brandon Sanderson, 3.5/5-** Definitely not my favorite of Sanderson's. I found it cheesy and awkward, though it's a good fit for the target audience of teen boys (I definitely think it's more for younger teens). Pacing and ending were both good, but I found the protagonist very annoying, and I often rolled my eyes at the hand-wavy tech that fixed plot contrivances. 

**Bottom of the TBR: A WIZARD OF EARTHSEA by Ursula K. Le Guin, 3.75/5-** I respect it because it's a classic but it's very slow, and I didn't like the audiobook narrator. The prose was excellent ""besides some stinkers"" as I wrote in my journal back in July, and the ending was very satisfying. I'm glad I finally got around to it, but won't be continuing with the series. Just wasn't interesting enough to me.

**Literary Fantasy: OUR WIVES UNDER THE SEA by Julia Armfield, 3.75/5-** I'm not one for literary fiction--I often find it pretentious and plodding. I also spent this entire book screaming FOR LOVE OF GOD VISIT A DOCTOR. But that would mess with the ~literariness~ so I guess they couldn't. It had the lengthy metaphors and anecdotes typical of literary fiction, but it was still interesting enough to finish. Did a very good job of capturing melancholy and did great character work.

**Young Adult: SORCERY OF THORNS by Margaret Rogerson, 4.5/5-** My only complaint here is that the ending was a liiiittle bit of a cop-out, but I really enjoyed the characters and bookish plot. This book was my first of Rogerson's, and it made me read the others too--I loved the novella sequel and I wish all of my favorite books could get extended epilogues. VESPERTINE is the best of hers, truly excellent YA. AN ENCHANTMENT OF RAVENS was also good, an interesting take on fae with a sweet relationship. 

**Mundane Jobs: DIVINE RIVALS by Rebecca Ross, 4.25/5-** Simultaneously cheesy and sad, this was a fun read that I devoured while also seeing its flaws. It could be choppy in places, and I found myself raising an eyebrow at some parts of the plot, but overall I had a good time. Haven't read the sequel yet.

**Published in the 00s: THE BLADE ITSELF by Joe Abercrombie, 4/5-** Very well written prose and good character work, but I have to say I didn't fall in love with r/Fantasy's darling. I found the plot kind of boring and rather than reading the rest of the trilogy, I Googled what happened, and I have to say I'm glad I didn't continue. It took around half the book for a woman to appear, and the two that eventually became characters were pretty one-note. I heard Abercrombie gets better at writing women and I may eventually read his later work, but while I could appreciate that this was a good book, it just wasn't for me.

**Angels and Demons: EVEN THOUGH I KNEW THE END by C.L. Polk, 4.5/5-** A bittersweet, engaging novella with excellent pacing that reminded me of TREAD OF ANGELS. I connected to the characters and rooted for them, and the ending satisfied me. Warm feelings only.

**Five SFF Short Stories: THE GATHERING DARK edited by Tori Bovalino, 3.75/5-** This anthology was just alright. None of the stories were scary and none stood out to me as particularly good (though I do remember one being particularly bad), but I did get some enjoyment out of it. Disclaimer that I am not really the short-stories type. Rereading this, I really sound like I didn't like this collection; I definitely did. I just didn't find anything particularly groundbreaking, but not everything has to be. 

**Horror: JACKAL by Erin E. Adams, 4.25/5-** I'm surprised this is a debut because it's so well written. There were times I felt disconnected from the protagonist's paranoia and a few sudden logical leaps, but overall this was a tense, emotional novel that I had a good time reading.

**Self-Published: AS BORN TO RULE THE STORM by Cate Baumer, 4/5-** A few formatting errors made my eyebrow twitch, but was cleanly written otherwise. Overall a short, enjoyable read, with interesting characters and a bittersweet time-loop plot. The author says it has ace rep but wouldn't have thought so from the text; it definitely wasn't overt, unless I missed something. Lots of pining.

**Middle Eastern SFF: THE CITY OF BRASS by S.A. Chakraborty, 4/5-** A decent start to a phenomenal trilogy. The book was bogged down by the extended travel sequence, but it ended in an interesting enough place that after some deliberation, I decided to continue. I'm so glad I did--Daevabad is easily one of my favorite trilogies now, and I love the short story collection too. If you're on the fence after reading the first book, I urge you to continue!

**Published in 2023: HELL BENT by Leigh Bardugo, 3.75/5-** A bit of a let-down, but I'm still excited for the final book. I spent a lot of this book waiting for Bardugo to get on with it--it dragged, and I found myself bored. However, the world-building remains excellent, and I love Alex Stern as a protagonist. Wish there was more Darlington; I think I'll get what I want in the last book.

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities: SABRIEL by Garth Nix, 4.25/5-** My one re-read. I read this for the first time around twelve years ago and it holds up. The relationships and characters could be more developed, but the plot was unique and engaging and I definitely *liked* the characters, I just thought we could delve a bit deeper. Bells + necromancy = love. 

**POC Author: THE SPEAR CUTS THROUGH WATER by Simon Jimenez, 4.75/5-** What an absolute triumph. 0.25 retracted because the first half dragged a bit and because of how often some words were repeated, but from the third part onward it was an absolutely excellent book, my favorite of 2023. It's a crime it wasn't nominated for the major awards. The POV work in this book is *chef's kiss,* a masterclass; if you liked THE SAINT OF BRIGHT DOORS and haven't read this, I think it scratches a similar itch despite being pretty different. 

**Book Club: THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE by Shirley Jackson, 4/5-** I liked it, but I would've liked it more if >!Eleanor had jumped in the library.!< Ending was a bit lackluster and could be jarring in places, and I was kinda disappointed because I didn't find it scary. But it was still good classic horror with interesting characters.  

**Novella: THE SCOURGE BETWEEN STARS by Ness Brown, 4.25/5-** A fun debut full of tension and emotion. There were a few things that didn't quite click into place for me, but overall, I enjoyed my time in Brown's world, and there were definitely parts where I was on the edge of my seat.

**Mythical Beasts: UNTETHERED SKY by Fonda Lee, 4/5-** Lee has discussed how much she hates the advice ""show don't tell,"" and while there are justified criticisms of it, all of her books have way too much telling in them for me. I don't read books for infodumps and surface-level prose. There are definitely things I like about this novella--the fast pace, the story itself, and the characters to an extent too. However, after reading JADE LEGACY this year as well, I think I'm done. Lee doesn't quite scratch the itch for me, even though there is a lot to admire about her work. 

**Elemental Magic: GODLY HEATHENS by H.E. Edgmon, 3.5/5-** Good ending, meh everything else. I found the character work very messy and the book was hard to get into. However, I do think I would've liked it more ten years ago when I was a teen, so if you have trans teens in your life, I'd recommend it.

**Myths and Retellings: THE DAUGHTER OF DOCTOR MOREAU by Silvia Moreno-Garcia, 4.25/5-** For sci-fi, this is much more character-heavy than science-heavy. I'm cloudy on some of the details and wish the world was a bit more fleshed out, but overall a good read. I need to read more Moreno-Garcia--I loved MEXICAN GOTHIC, but haven't read any others. Of the two, MEXICAN GOTHIC was better imo.

**Queernorm Setting: STAR EATER by Kerstin Hall, 2.75/5-** My least favorite of the list, which is unfortunate because I was really looking forward to it. I found the world to be over-complicated and scatterbrained, and the ending wasn't very satisfying to me. There were some things, like the magic system, that could've been more interesting if developed better.

**Coastal/Island Setting: THE BONE SHARD WAR by Andrea Stewart, 3.5/5-** I really would have benefited from reading this trilogy one right after the other, because the two year gap I took between books two and three didn't help. The conclusion was satisfying once I remembered what the hell was going on, but the pacing was a bit wonky. For the whole trilogy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the prose--I found it a bit too straightforward and even a bit juvenile. But I enjoyed the characters and the worldbuilding.

**Druids: SILVER IN THE BONE by Alexandra Bracken, 3.5/5-** Ending spoilers: >!I was totally into the downer ending, but it was completely cheapened by people close to the MC coming back to life. I found the ending cowardly.!< Anyway, there were interesting elements to this book, but I failed to really connect with it. I'm curious about what happens next, but not enough to read the upcoming sequel. There are better Arthurian retellings, like my first square or SPEAR. 

**Featuring Robots: SYSTEM COLLAPSE by Martha Wells, 4.5/5-** Mmm love me some Murderbot, even though it's been repetitive for the last few iterations. It's like putting on my favorite pair of socks. If you're looking for an interesting cozy sci-fi with an intensely likeable protagonist, Murderbot is for you.

**Sequel: PAINTED DEVILS by Margaret Owen, 4.25/5-** LITTLE THIEVES was my favorite book of 2022, and while I enjoyed this one too, I felt like Vanja's character arc took a nosedive. This book is more for teen girls with low self-esteem than the first book, but it had a lot of the same magic too. Loved the familial elements. I'm eagerly awaiting the conclusion of the trilogy!

1711502298.0,Looking for Suggestions on Fantasy Books that are not in a Series,"Hello all!

I was wondering if any of you had any suggestions of books that I could read: 

\- I would like a book that is NOT part of a series - already have tons of it, and I would like to get a book to ""reset"" between 2 series

\- I read the series ""From Blood & Ash"", I liked it, but I preferred ""Shadow in the amber"" - I, like, devoured it

\- I really like dragons, magic, but I was wondering if I could find something more mystical, grim. Maybe something with a thieve or an assassin, that could change from what I usually read (tired of dragons)

\- Preferably in a world that does not exist, I don't like something that is too close to reality

\- BONUS if I can find a hardcover limited version (:

My first language is not English (it's French), so it is kind of hard for me to really find something that would suit me when going through the lists, because there are sooooooo many choices and I really don't know where to orient myself. The selection is not that developed in French, and I would like to read some books in English also. I don't mind if it is difficult to read - I'm searching for a ""kindof"" challenge, and I want to push myself to read more in my second language.

If it can give you an idea, here are some series that I've read recently:

\- Eragon Series (I know,

\- From Blood & Ash Series

\- A Court of Thorns and Roses Series

\- Bone Season Series

\- A Chorus of Dragons Series

\- I am planning on getting myself the Shadow and Bone trilogy

\- My boyfriend got me the first tome of Blood & Steel, so I will give it a try later

Thank you kind people! <3

1) enemies to lovers but in a specific form - the vampire hunter falls in love with the vampire. I am almost finish with the Anita Blake series which is this plus other supernatural and police work. Books on this trope or read-a-likes to this series would be lovely. 

2) dystopia - I've recently read ""Wilder girls"" by rory powers, ""Station eleven"" by Emily st John Mandel and ""hungry"" by Heather swain and loved all of them even though they are vastly different in style and setting. Anything like them would be lovely. 

3) the fae court - the books I have loved most with the fae court have been the Mery Gentry series which is mostly spicy (reverse harem) and lots of court drama. But I love the fae court mythology and would love other books set there

1711492734.0,Charlotte Reads: Vespertine by Margaret Rogerson," (Thanks to u/noldotrash for giving me the inspiration to post this review today!)

**So What’s It About?**  


*The dead of Loraille do not rest.*  


*Artemisia  is training to be a Gray Sister, a nun who cleanses the bodies of the  deceased so that their souls can pass on; otherwise, they will rise as  spirits with a ravenous hunger for the living. She would rather deal  with the dead than the living, who trade whispers about her scarred  hands and troubled past.*  


*When her convent is attacked by  possessed soldiers, Artemisia defends it by awakening an ancient spirit  bound to a saint’s relic. It is a revenant, a malevolent being that  threatens to possess her the moment she drops her guard. Wielding its  extraordinary power almost consumes her—but death has come to Loraille,  and only a vespertine, a priestess trained to wield a high relic, has  any chance of stopping it. With all knowledge of vespertines lost to  time, Artemisia turns to the last remaining expert for help: the  revenant itself.*  


*As she unravels a sinister mystery of saints,  secrets, and dark magic, her bond with the revenant grows. And when a  hidden evil begins to surface, she discovers that facing this enemy  might require her to betray everything she has been taught to believe—if  the revenant doesn’t betray her first.*  


**What I Thought**  


I think *Vespertine* is an example of the best YA fantasy has to offer today!!!! :)   


By  far my favorite part of the book is the relationship that develops  between Artemesia and the revenant inhabiting her. Mistrust and a grudging alliance eventually transform into a unique bond where they  truly care for each other (even if that care doesn’t look the way we  typically expect it to). A huge part of the connection they form comes  from Artemisia realizing that no one has ever treated the revenant like a  person or cared for it in all its years being a bound spirit. She is  able to realize this and empathize because of how she has been  dehumanized for a large part of her life as well. I love both of their  personalities and how well they work together - to a certain extent,  they’re both morbid, misanthropic weirdos! The revenant definitely  steals the show a lot of the time with its macabre sense of humor and  disgust for humans (and nuns in particular).   


Artemisia is a  great character in her own right. She is odd and unhappy and socially  awkward due to all the time she was forced to spend in isolation, and  she has some very thoughtfully incorporated trauma responses such as not  really knowing how to take care of her body or notice what’s happening  to it. The revenant notices this and helps her learn to take care of  herself in another example of what makes their relationship unique. The  book has a bit of a sense of humor about Artemesia’s social awkwardness  and negativity sometimes, such as when she’s miserable when dragged  along to windowshop on a holiday, but it’s always done in a very  understanding, loving way.   


She is also able to form some lovely  relationships with humans. There’s a great moment where she and her  convent roommate Marguerite realize how they have both made assumptions  and miscommunicated with each other and turn over a fresh leaf after  that. She is also able to understand and protect a traumatized soldier  who everyone fears and get the help of a truly badass convent Mother named Mother Dolours.   


My only critiques are very minimal. I  don’t know quite how to explain the first one, but it feels like there  is no real sense of what is happening with the world’s magic and lore or  what is actually possible with them until Artemesia uncovers a new  plot-related discovery. It’s all complicated enough that I’m not sure  how Rogerson could have done this more effectively, but it did feel a  bit like grasping at straws all the way through as a reader. My final  thought is just a passing silly one - while I think Leander is an  interesting character and his relationship with Artemesia is good, I  feel like he never gets described without a reference to his angelic,  chiseled face, his elegant, long-fingered hands, his hard chest, his  spare, tense, taut body etc etc lol. We get it!!!!!!  


This was such a thorough pleasure to read that I’m bumping *A Sorcery of Thorns* up in my TBR queue. I really hope I enjoy it just as much!! ",Fantasy
1711491233.0,My Bingo Reviews: Row 4,"  

My penultimate row of bingo reviews: 

**The Doctrines of Fire by CL Jarvis**

**Bingo Squares: Book Club,** mundane jobs

George Stephens is a lousy medical student. Lacking the social and financial resources to succeed in Edinburgh’s elite medical school, his dream of becoming a physician appears over before it began. Then George comes to the attention of two famous professors, William Cullen and Joseph Black. Medical students are dying mysteriously - the professors suspect an embittered rival and dark magic is to blame - and they need George’s help uncovering the truth. Their investigation pulls them into the murkiest, most dangerous corners of Enlightenment Edinburgh. The professors are secret wielders of fire magic, but their foes are courting even darker forces. With violence threatening to erupt, and George struggling to navigate this confusing city, getting justice for the dead will be harder than he imagined.

**My Review: 3/5 stars**

As someone who is Scottish, I am always intrigued (and wary) of books set in my home country. Doctrines of Fire is set in Edinburgh and does a great job of capturing the essence of Edinburgh and building an atmosphere that interlaces mystery and dark academia. The historical element of the story works well and is carefully detailed – at no point does it feel unrealistic or forced, instead the reader feels that they have stepped clearly into 1700s Edinburgh as the plot unfolds. 

Unfortunately, the other elements of the story didn’t work as well for me. George, as the main character felt a bit bland, and I struggled to become fully invested in his character. I also felt that the academic rivalry that underpinned the story as a whole was just a bit too low stakes for me and seemed almost secondary to the world building going on. All in all, the book was well-written, but I suspect more suited to those who enjoy historical or low-fantasy fantasy novels.

**Montego – Brian McClellan**

**Bingo Squares: Novella (HM)**

**What it is about:** Twelve-year-old Montego al'Bou is an orphan, a provincial peasant boy left alone by the recent death of his grandmother. Possessing nothing more than his grandmother's cudgel, he strikes out to the capital where the influential Grappo have offered to bring him up in the luxury of an Ossan guild-family. He finds his welcome frosty and quickly discovers that the greatest sin in the capital is to be born without money. Montego dreams of being his own man, of making it in the cudgelling arenas of the Empire's deadly spectator sport where even a provincial can be worshipped like a god. But skill isn't the only barrier, without allies, cunning, and a helping of daring, he can't hope to make it in the capital.

**My Review: 3/5 stars**

Montego is a prequal to McClellan’s *In the Shadow of Lightning,* but it is one that benefits majorly from reading Shadow of Lightning first. My problem, however, was that despite reading the first book, I had forgotten quite a lot of the major plot points. Although I enjoyed Montego, I possibly would have enjoyed it more if I hadn’t spent so much of it trying to remember who everyone was. 

Having read McClellan’s previous works, I would generally have said that his strength lies in magic systems and action scenes. However, although Montego has action, the magic system plays only a limited role. In Montego, we really get to see McClellan’s strength as a character writer, we learn about Montego’s background, not only getting a better of Montego himself, but also the characters of Demir and Kizzie. McClellan writes these characters well, and you do find yourself invested both in them and their friendship.

**Untethered Sky – Fonda Lee**

**Bingo Squares: Fantastic Beasts (HM),** POC Author, Novella

**What it is about:** Ester’s family was torn apart when a manticore killed her mother and baby brother, leaving her with nothing but her father’s painful silence and a single, overwhelming need to kill the monsters that took her family. Ester’s path leads her to the King’s Royal Mews, where the giant rocs of legend are flown to hunt manticores by their brave and dedicated ruhkers. Paired with a fledgling roc named Zahra, Ester finds purpose and acclaim by devoting herself to a calling that demands absolute sacrifice and a creature that will never return her love. The terrifying partnership between woman and roc leads Ester not only on the empire’s most dangerous manticore hunt, but on a journey of perseverance and acceptance.

**My Review: 5/5 stars**

I loved this book, and if I have any complaints, it is that it’s only a novella, I absolutely feel this world deserves a longer story. Untethered Sky is a story that I would describe as fantastic in the most literal sense. Fonda Lee has managed to create this amazing world that I would love to visit (despite the monsters). Rocs are wild animals that can be unpredictable, requiring a lot of knowledge in their trainers. Lee has clearly researched falconry and has infused this into the story. It means that such a fantastic career feels so real and as a reader I felt so invested in Ester and Zahra and the success of their relationship. 

Ester as the main character is engaging, and I found it impressive that in such a short story Lee is able to make the reader empathise so much with Ester. We feel her anger at what happened to her family, her desperation to be a good rukher and how much she cares about her Roc, Zahra. It is easy to become emotionally invested in what happens to the pair. Probably because of the length of Untether Sky, we are introduced to other characters, but they are not especially fleshed out. The other rukhers that Ester befriends act to flesh out the world. Some of the lessons of Rukhery that Ester describes, we see made flesh in these other characters (and their rocs) and the decisions they make, both good and bad.

**Her Majesty’s Royal Coven – Juno Dawson**

**Bingo Squares: Elemental Magic (HM),** Mundane Jobs

**What it is about:** Hidden among us is a secret government department of witches known as Her Majesty’s Royal Coven. They protect crown and country from magical forces and otherworldly evil, but their greatest enemy will come from within…There are whisperings of a prophecy that will bring the coven to its knees, and four best friends are about to be caught at the centre. Life as a modern witch was never simple … but now it’s about to get apocalyptic.

**My Review: 2/5 stars**

This is a book that I feel would have benefitted from more editing, there is the bones of a good story I just really struggled with the execution. Dawson covers some important issues in this book, about transgender and LGBT rights but the execution just fell flat to me. It felt like the reader was being told about these issues, but not really shown the impact. We are told about how evil the main antagonist is, and how wrong her views are instead of really seeing the impact it is having on the character in question. It felt preachy, which is never good. I was also disappointed by the treatment of Leonie and her coven, it is clear that Dawson wanted to acknowledge the difficulties of BME women, but it is given so little time or space that it feels more like a tick box exercise that actual representation. 

I also struggled with the character development, other than Niamh none of the main characters felt fully fleshed out. The main villain of the story is a terf, who goes through such a rapid and extreme change in character that it feels unrealistic and honestly just baffling at times. By the end of the story, the villain is about as believable as one of those moustache twirling villains you see in a panto. I also feel like she is given too much space in the book, that actually could have been spent with the transgender character in question. Given this book is being lauded in transgender and LGBT communities, a lot of must be really triggering and yet there are no warnings given about this. 

&#x200B;

**Grace of Kings – Ken Liu**

**Bingo Squares: Myths and Retellings (HM),** POC author, queer-norm, coastal setting.

Emperor Mapidéré was the first to unite the island kingdoms of Dara under a single banner. But now the emperor is on his deathbed, his people are exhausted by his vast, conscriptive engineering projects and his counsellors conspire only for their own gain. A wily, charismatic bandit and the vengeance-sworn son of a deposed duke cross paths as they each lead their own rebellion against the emperor's brutal regime. Together, they will journey to the heart of the empire, witnessing the clash of armies, fleets of silk-draped airships, magical books and shapeshifting gods. Their unlikely friendship will drastically change the balance of power in Dara... but at what price?

**My Review: 5/5 stars**

I thoroughly enjoyed this book, if I was tempted to knock a star off it is mainly because Liu could not continue his brilliance into the next book. I was surprised to hear that this book is often described as hard to finish, because I found the story flowed really well. I thought the book was excellently written and well-paced, this is quite a long book and covers a span of time, but because of Liu’s tendency to move from plot point to plot point without getting too bogged down in exposition, it works brilliantly and really helps to keep the reader engaged in the story. 

I also liked that the setting was not yet another Western Europe knockoff, it feels clearly East Asian in inspiration. Although I will say the meddling Gods give me Ancient Greek vibes. However, it is the characters that really make this story, although we are introduced to various characters, it is really Kuni Garu and Mati Zyndu that form the heart of this. These two compliment and contrast one another well and it is easy to become invested in their friendship and heartbroken about how that evolves. I do think the story could have benefitted from more impactful female characters, but in the end this was not enough for me to change my rating of the story. ",Fantasy
1711487243.0,2023 5-star Bingo Reviews!,"This was my first time completing a bingo and it totally reignited my love for reading! I picked up books I probably never would have before and literally fell in love with them! Like seriously, I discovered new all time favorites thanks to bingo! I can’t wait to do it again this year.

My full card is linked at the bottom of this post!

Here are mini, spoiler-free reviews of my 5 star standouts from this card:

**Set in the Middle East: City of Brass by SA Chakraborty**

Such a unique fantasy story set in the 18th century middle east. I've never read anything like this before. The characters, the world-building, the magic, everything about it I just loved!! I love how this world is rooted in real 18th century middle eastern politics and culture. I feel like I'm learning a lot about this time period and this part of the world which I previously had very little knowledge of. I'm even learning a little Arabic along the way :))

**Book Club: The Justice of Kings by Richard Swan** 

You know when a book checks every box for you?? This is pretty much that book for me. 

Complicated, flawed, deeply human characters that evolve and change throughout the story? Check.

Rich world-building in a fantasy setting with a hint of magic? Check.

Discussions about the nature of good and evil, right and wrong, law and order? Super check!

**Queernorm Setting: Winter’s Orbit by Everina Maxwell**

This is an amazing start to a compelling sci-fi duology filled with action, betrayal, plot-twists, gut-wrenching romance, and political scandal set against a futuristic backdrop.The way the author illustrated the after-effects of being in abusive relationship (not trusting anyone, even yourself, monitoring your partner's emotions, worrying about what goes on in private) was so sensitive and well handled.

**Coastal Setting: The Bone Ships by RJ Baker**

This book!!! I am just so so obsessed with this epic fantasy saga on the high seas! It has everything I could possibly want: mysterious sea dragons, high seas naval battles, underdog yet still badass captain and crew! This was one of the best starts to a fantasy series I've ever read! This story also does something that I truly love about the fantasy genre: it imagines a world where things are completely different from the one we are currently living in. Better in some ways, worse in other ways.

**Published in 2023: Deep as the Sky, Red as the Sea by Chang-Eppig**

What a powerful, emotional story! This high-seas historical-fiction adventure in the South China Sea is also a story of womanhood and the price of survival in a cruel, unforgiving world. Chang-Eppig tells this story in a succinct, but also beautiful way. No scene or word felt like filler or unnecessary fluff. Her words were chosen carefully and with intent to make the reader think and feel. I flew through this story as a result of the masterful storytelling. I really felt like I was sailing through the seas on a pirate ship with Shek Yeung and her crew.

**Angels and Demons: Light from Uncommon Stars by Rya Aoki** 

Who would've thought to combine demons, donuts, space aliens, and violins?!? Ryka Aoki, that's who!! There's a lot of amazing themes in this book but the main one that grabbed me was the struggle for acceptance and what does it mean to be included? I also really love the way Aoki writes about music and violins. Music is hard to capture with words, but I felt like I could hear the violin songs playing in my head as I was turning the pages of this book. 

**Horror: The Hacienda By Isabel Canas**

This is such a beautiful, haunting, dark ghost story about, among other things, a haunted Hacienda. Set in the aftermath of the Mexican war of independence, the story takes you on a captivating journey of pain, death, life, suspense, and romance. This book has some of the most beautiful prose I've ever read. If you're looking for dark, atmospheric vibes and beautiful turn-of-phrase, look no further. I almost want to reread this book in physical form so I can highlight Canas' beautiful, descriptive sentences.

**Mundane Job: A Wizard’s Guide to Defensive Baking by TJ Kingfisher**

I highly recommend the audiobook because the narrator truly made this character come alive for me. This is my first time trying cozy fantasy and let me tell you I’m obsessed! I loved the baking magic and Mona’s adorably sassy gingerbread and sourdough starter familiars. I just couldn’t stop smiling at the creative use of magic, even though there were definitely some dark moments. I wish I could go visit Mona’s bakery and try a magical chocolate chip muffin! Seriously, this is one of the most unique wizard magic I’ve ever read and I love the concept of making the most of what you have and coming up with clever solutions!

1711479713.0,"In the context of Fantasy books, what's your opinion on Roland Barthes’ theory of critique?","Literary critic Roland Barthes created the ""Death of the Author"" theory in an essay of the same name during the 1960s. It posits that the author's intentions or background shouldn't be used to glean a definitive meaning for a text but rather the readers’ individual interpretations of it are more correct because the work essentially is subsumed into the entire body of all works written by humankind. A popular way of phrasing the concept is “separate the art from the artist” (and a popular rebuttal is “seizing the art from the artist”), and it's apparently a theory particularly susceptible to misinterpretations.

I'm trying to learn more and gauge opinions from other people and was wondering what this community thinks about it in the context of Fantasy, where all aspects of story—theme, characters, worldbuilding, etc—might actually *be* intentional allegories or metaphors for which the author intends a specific meaning.

https://preview.redd.it/f3allicrrpqc1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa6dfecc0d9080f46958ca927e79dc54673999f

Review originally on [JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/the-hallows-by-hl-tinsley)

 

*The Hallows* is a grim fantasy standalone novel, written by H.L. Tinsley, also known as the author of *We Men of Ash and Shadow*, SPFBO7 finalist. I was absolutely captivated by the taglines in the cover, and I can tell you, it totally fulfills its promise, throwing an incredible story where the 1920s inspired setting is part of what makes it absolutely incredible to read, with characters that you won't forget easily.

Camellia is a low-ranking employee for the Providence Company, the powerful company which controls the production and distribution of The Hallow, a serum which after being taken grants magical abilities to the Auld Ones; the distribution of this serum is not only controlled as a business, but also because it is deadly for humans. But the Providence Company is not only a business, but a religion, with the highest ranking among them combining the functions of nuns and businessmen; the low-ranking employees are assigned to small teams, taking their name from the theme of the team (Camellia belong to the Garden).  
At the start of our story, Camellia is tasked with the investigation of a series of deaths that might be related with the serum consumption, coinciding with the election of an Auld One for the first time for the office; a story with this premise goes from the low strata of the society to the more powerful ones, while weaving a complex plot that trusts on the reader to reconstruct the full image.

Trust me, this is a really dark story, specially when we are diving deep into the complicated world that exists as a result of the use of The Hallow: power comes with a cost, meaning that after years using it, it's inevitable to get affected and ""be retired"" from the company; the low-ranking Auld are basically expendable people that use their condition as a way to keep a salary, even if that means the risk of using The Hallow. Companies that employ them are driven by greed, forcing them to overdose in order to fulfill the quotas; and Auld Ones are in a lower social class in terms of rights.  
However, there's also space for camaraderie and found family among all the darkness, as Tinsley has an ability to paint exceptionally human characters, like Camellia, who appreciates and try to help all those that are under his guide; some fun is hidden among the darkness.

Worldbuilding is an integral part of *The Hallows*, the underneath layer that keeps all working and that at the same time, makes this book a special one, which is not afraid of touching themes such as identity (lack of real names in the organization, names that are reused) and the dangers of extremism. You can feel an alive city where the characters and the story is just a drop of water in the ocean.

*The Hallows* is an excellent grimdark story set in an unique backdrop; but even if you are not fan of the genre, you should give a try to this book, as it touches really deep themes. Tinsley is a master at writing grim fantasy, and hopefully, this is not the only entry on this world.",Fantasy
1711473065.0,"2023 Bingo mini-reviews: Vespertine, Oleander Sword, Thorn, and other great reads","Another successful bingo year! This year I was so close to full hard mode I decided to go for it, although Robots and Mundane Jobs nearly tripped me up.

My favorite bingo book this year was *Vespertine* by Margaret Rogerson (I cannot scream enough about this book, go read it), and my favorite new-to-me author was Richard Swan, author of *The Justice of Kings*.

[Crossed swords emoji indicates hard mode. I could have read a whole 'nother book last week in the amount of time I spent fiddling with my spreadsheet to make it produce this card.](https://preview.redd.it/igckkxitjpqc1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a881bb24714c9a62a382f03381c663473ece6b4c)

**ROW 1**

**Title With a Title:** *The Daughter of Doctor Moreau* by Silvia Moreno-Garcia. This retelling of The Island of Doctor Moreau (which I have not read btw) is not the author's strongest work but is still great. I wasn't really sold on the hybrids but was very sold on Sad Boy Montgomery. 4 stars

**Superheroes:** *Hench* by Natalie Zina Walschots. Fun, clever anti-superhero book that I devoured in an evening. Love me some spreadsheet nerd rep. However, be warned: there was some nauseating body horror at the end that I was not prepared for!! Eugh. 4 stars

**Bottom of the TBR:** *The Blue Sword* by Robin McKinley. I would've been absolutely OBSESSED with this as a kid. It made me feel so nostalgic for the time when I too would have loved to be kidnapped by super cool horse warriors and trained to fight. 4 stars

**Magical Realism:** *The Mirror Season* by Anna-Marie McLemore. YA magical realism focused on the aftermath of sexual assault. This was an uncomfortable (and occasionally graphic) read at times but one I'm very glad I read. Beautifully written and very thought provoking. 4.5 stars

**Young Adult:** *Vespertine* by Margaret Rogerson. I cannot yell enough about this book. Nuanced characters who break stereotypes! Villains with depth! Found family! Everything about this was *amazing*. Please read this. 5 stars

&#x200B;

**ROW 2**

**Mundane Jobs:** *Going Postal* by Terry Pratchett. I originally a different book for this and then a week ago remembered that book has flashbacks to earth and might not count. Panic ensued, but it had a happy ending and I am so glad I read this book. It's cleverly hilarious - Pratchett's character descriptions had me in stitches - but with a core of deeper meaning to it. 4.5 stars.

**Published in the 2000s:** *Never Let Me Go* by Kazuo Ishiguro. The less you know about this book going into it, the better your reading experience will probably be. That said, I went into it knowing the twist and was still blown away. It's a literary novel that is super thought-provoking. I was impressed by the subtlety of character dynamics. 5 stars

**Angels and Demons:** *The Screwtape Letters* by C.S. Lewis. This book is a collection of letters from a senior demon to a more junior demon. I appreciated it from a faith perspective, but if you're reading it purely as a fantasy book, your mileage may vary. C.S. Lewis’ writing is excellent – the voice and tone make this an entertaining read despite the heavy (in a religious sense) subject matter. 4 stars

**Short Stories:** *New Suns*, Ed. Nisi Shawl. Some stories I enjoyed, others not so much. It's a fine collection but I'm not super into short stories overall. 3.5 stars

**Horror:** *The Only Good Indians* by Steven Graham Jones. I read this book and thought “this wasn't that scary,” and then heard a random noise in my apartment and was paralyzed with fear that I was about to be killed lol. For someone who doesn't usually read horror I found this a bit gruesome, but I still liked it overall, especially the ending. 4 stars

&#x200B;

**ROW 3**

**Self-Published:** *Where Madness Lies* by Heidi K. Allen. This story focused on Greek gods has some debut roughness, but I'll still keep an eye out for more in this series. There are some interesting takes on the gods that I wasn't expecting, and I appreciate the author dug deeper instead of sticking with only surface-level Greek god stereotypes. 3 stars

**Set in the Middle East:** *The Map of Salt and Stars* by Zeyn Joukhadar. This barely counts as speculative IMO, but I’m super glad I read this. The B plot about the mapmaker is not that interesting, but the main plot of a 12 year old refugee crossing the Middle East is a very compelling and important story. I highly recommend it. The first chapter came across a bit pretentious, but the writing style gets better. 4 stars

**Published in 2023:** *Midnight Strikes* by Zeba Shahnaz. Finally a book to scratch my time loop itch. It also had some debut roughness with a few iffy plot choices and political scheming that didn't quite work for me, but I still enjoyed it. The time looping was handled really well, and the ending was surprisingly nuanced. No I did not tear up, I just got something in my eye, ok? 3 stars

**Multiverse:** *The Gone World* by Tom Sweterlisch. This was pitched as Christopher Nolan meets gritty crime show, and that's very accurate. Not really the book for me – between some gore and the overall brain-twistiness, I found it too disturbing – but it's a very well-executed and tightly plotted novel. 4.5 stars

**POC Author:** *We Have Always Been Here* by Lena Nguyen. 5/5 concepts, 3/5 execution. This sci-fi thriller featuring a misanthropic psychologist and lots of robots was a good enough book, but it could've been an amazing book. I will absolutely be reading more of this author though. 3.5 stars

&#x200B;

**ROW 4**

**Book Club:** *The Justice of Kings* by Richard Swan. Super glad book club picked this book – it was awesome! It's a murder mystery, but also there's tension at a much larger scale. Konrad's arc was super interesting and I'm excited to keep reading the series. 4.5 stars

**Novella:** *Tread of Angels* by Rebecca Roanhorse. A perfectly serviceable novella featuring angels, demons, and legal drama/mystery, although it could've benefited from being longer. Everything else I've read by Rebecca Roanhorse I've enjoyed a lot more though. 3 stars

**Mythical Beasts:** *Bad Cree* by Jessica Johns. Interesting supernatural thriller. It's advertised as horror…but IMO this is not that scary and I don't even read horror. I liked the slow backstory reveal, family helping family, and reading about Cree culture. 4 stars

**Elemental Magic:** *The Rise of Kyoshi* by F.C. Lee. It's been a long time since I watched The Last Airbender, but I didn't really vibe with this as a backstory for Kyoshi. Still enjoyed it though, and the antagonist was really well written. 3.5 stars

**Myths and Retellings:** *Thorn* by Intisar Khanani. Another book with incredible characterization. Really heart-breaking and thought-provoking depiction of the trauma of abuse, yet the main character remained strong, noble, and kind despite that. 4.5 stars

&#x200B;

**ROW 5**

**Queernorm:** *The Bone Shard War* by Andrea Stewart. A decent, satisfying ending to a good series. It's not as good as book one (there was a bit much talking things out in this one) but I still recommend the series. The worldbuilding is very interesting. Jovis is definitely the star of this last book. 4 stars

**Coastal Setting:** *The Fall of Numenor* by J.R.R. Tolkien. This is a timeline of the second age of Middle Earth. Some timeline elements are brief, others are longer narratives. I loved this - as usual, Tolkien has some great themes - but if you're expecting it to be a novel with one narrative, it's not that. 5 stars

**Druid:** *The Oleander Sword* by Tasha Suri. I wish I could write like this. Tasha Suri has created an absolutely incredible fantasy world, and the characters really drive the story forward in fascinating ways. Definitely one of the best written books I read for bingo, and I can't wait for book three. 4.5 stars

**Featuring Robots:** *Network Effect* by Martha Wells. I started reading System Collapse for this, but got confused by that and reread Network Effect instead. (I usually do not reread previous books in a series no matter how confused I am, so this is major personal growth for me.) How did I not clock how good this book was the first time I read it?? It’s awesome. Just the right amount of snark, a hefty dose of robot emotions, and a taste of horror. I've found some other Murderbot books to be too heavy on the snark but Network Effect is \*chef’s kiss.\* 4.5 stars

**Sequel:** *Locklands* by Robert Jackson Bennett. This was a great ending to the series, up till the epilogue, which I honestly wish had been left off and really killed any satisfaction I had. 4 stars",Fantasy

1711466767.0,Book Review: The Will of the Many,"I never write book reviews, but I just discovered this one and couldn’t help myself! The Will of the Many by James Islington caught my attention because of the classical cover art, the Roman Empire backdrop, and the magical academy trope. I'm glad I found it! The single POV, Islington's thoroughly descriptive prose, and his real-time writing made me *feel* the passage of time and deeply connect with the main character, Vis. This was intensified by the slow world-building and a play-by-play of Vis' interactions with secondary characters. His thoughts, hopes, doubts, and constant strategizing ran through the pages like a chyron at the bottom of a news channel.

If you're a movie connoisseur and appreciate cinematography, I would liken this book to the war film, 1917. It is referred to as a ""one-shot masterpiece"" and appears to be filmed in one continuous take. Despite the fact that 1917 spans several hours in one day, the one-shot method makes viewers feel as if they are living each action-packed moment alongside the protagonists. The effect, then, is an incredible attachment to each event as it plays out and to the characters emotional journey. Similarly, Islington's writing develops a deep connectedness with the MMC and the plot. Thus, I was hooked on the sub-plots as much as the main plot... if not more.

Along with Vis, I didn't know who to trust and constantly awaited new information. By the end, it felt like I was watching Inception, Tenet or Interstellar for the first time [more movie references, I know]. I was SO mind blown by the ending that I felt inclined to reread the book in light of my newfound knowledge.

When recommending this book to folks, I tell them to settle in with the main character and prepare for the world building. Write things down if you need to! Each part of the book is different from the next and the ending is worth the wait. It's a great coming of age story with Roman composition and a gnarly reel-you in cliffhanger at the end.

Finally, I have two concluding thoughts: a request and a lamentation.

My request is based on personal preference and is not a deficiency. In other words, it is feedback regarding book one and a request to Islington for book two. I love epic fantasies that are woven with tidbits for readers to over-analyze and formulate theories about what's coming down the line. The Will of the Many did not have enough (or, I daresay, any) easter eggs that allowed me to remotely anticipate the book's ending. Now, that was probably by design; however, I would have loved for more things to figure out or read into along the way. Therefore, I humbly request for more in book

Second, my lamentation... I am deeply wounded by the fact that I discovered this book long after the release of special edition copies. The special edition cover art, sprayed edges, and inside book cover are TO DIE FOR and anything left on the internet is highly sought after and, therefore, very expensive. Well done, Islington & Co.! ! love books that are as wonderful on the outside as they are on the inside. I'l be prepared to jump on any future special edition releases! Can't wait to see what happens with book two, The Strength of the Few.

Cheers.",Fantasy
1711466716.0,Book Review: Play of Shadows (Court of Shadows #1) by Sebastian de Castell,"**TL;DR:** True to the spirit of the Greatcoats, but fresh and unique. Thrilling, complex, and absolutely addictive.

https://preview.redd.it/3kier0o75pqc1.jpg?width=667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b101545f7874177c925990bfef061f9e5cc422e

### Full Review:

It’s not often a book leaves me speechless.

This one pulled it off. Repeatedly.

*The Court of Shadows* plays in Tristia, the world of the *Greatcoats,* at some unspecified number of years following the end of *Tyrant’s Throne.*

In it, we follow Damelas Chademantaigne, grandson to not one, but *two* Greatcoats. And, unfortunately, a coward who begins his story by fleeing a duel and hiding out in a theatre to become an actor rather than face certain death at the hands of a superior foe.

But this is where *Court of Shadows,* like *Greatcoats,* proves its true worth. For the character we meet in the opening pages is not the *true* character—just who he thinks himself to be.

In *Greatcoats*, Falcio was like a chipped, dented sword that still had a razor’s edge. Damelas, however, is a sword covered in the tarnish and rust of perceived cowardice. But underneath lies the same steel. Through his trials and tribulations—many the results of his own actions, naturally—he is scoured and honed until his true courage is bared for all to see.

His character arc is absolutely delightful, but the truth is that he doesn’t have a great deal of growing to do. The more we come to know this “Rabbit” who fled a fight in the beginning, the more we see just how much the ethos and spirit of the Greatcoats is present in every fiber of his being.

The characters around him are as colorful and varied as would be expected from a company of actors. His lecherous-yet-steadfast best friend is a comedic foil to his somber moments, yet brings a great deal of heart and daring when his courage inevitably falters. His fellow players provide excellent contrasts for every aspect of his journey and personality, and before long, they are as foundational to his world—and our story—as Damelas himself is.

From the beginning, there is a subtle sense of foreshadowing, of lurking villains hiding in the darkness, that slowly permeates the story and grows ever-more noticeable as events unfold. What starts out as a flicker of shadow in the corner is cleverly built upon and played out until it becomes the all-consuming monster threatening to swallow the city of Jereste and destroy everything Damelas is fighting to protect.

The antagonists of the piece are clear from the beginning, and yet there is so much more to the story than meets the eye. Heroes become villains and villains become heroes in the blink of an eye or the recitation of a single line. And every new discovery in this marvelous—and magical—play adds a fresh layer to the grand mystery. A mystery into which I guarantee you will be inexorably drawn.

I found myself intrigued at first, then entertained, then swept up in the story so fully I devoured the second half in one sitting to find out how it ended. The story brought me to tears not once, but *twice* (no mean feat), and I got chills on more than one occasion as the heroism of Damelas and his fellow players came to the fore.  

For Greatcoats fans, we are gifted with a greater insight into the workings of the Bardatti (the counterparts to the Trattari), and the subtle manipulations that were hinted at in the original series are now core to Damelas’ story. It’s an expansion on the magic, myths, and worldbuilding that made us fall in love with Tristia in the first place.

*Play of Shadows* is true to the spirit of the original Greatcoats in every way, and yet is utterly fresh and unique. From its humble beginning to its epic end, it stands among the author’s finest works—and has me absolutely champing at the bit to see where the Court of Shadows’ adventure will take me next.  ",Fantasy

1711464074.0,"New Release, Nocturnus, by Devon C Ford #Review #MilitaryUrbanFantasy","TLDR: Werewolves in a barrel, that was fun!

I’ve read a bunch of Devon C Ford and rate this among his most entertaining! This is a bit Urban Fantasy with a secret fantasy realm existing in the shadows because humanity couldn’t handle if werewolves were real. Suspended disbelief: check. The setting is fascinating, with plenty of room to become a Jim Butcher side piece ;). I don’t seek Urban Fantasies, maybe because suspending disbelief is harder for me in that genre. After this I think I’ll branch out a little more. 

Next up: characters. His pov characters are all realistic and pleasant to follow. The hero is a bit gruff, but he’s understandable and I’m rooting for him in this new endeavor. We have a couple female characters of focus that show how well rounded Devon is with his cast. While the setting has enough detail and intrigue to keep me interested, the characters and their growth is the real driver of the story and series.

The audio sounded great! Jay Snyder strikes a great tone to match the characters and the action to come. His books are always top notch, and this is no exception. Maybe my favorite of his so far. Good enough audio will be my preferred method for consuming this series.

Anyone else read this or Devon’s works? What do you think about the Urban Military Fantasy mashup? Reminds me a bit of Myke Cole.",Fantasy

>**A dangerous cat-and-mouse quest for revenge. An empire that    spans star systems, built on the bones of a genocide. A carefully   hidden  secret that could collapse worlds, hunted by three women with   secrets  of their own. All collide in this twisty, explosive space opera   debut,  perfect for readers of Arkady Martine and Kameron Hurley.**  
Jun   Ironway—hacker, con artist, and occasional thief—has gotten her  hands   on a piece of contraband that could set her up for proof that    implicates the powerful Nightfoot family in a planet-wide genocide    seventy-five years ago. The Nightfoots control the precious sevite that    fuels interplanetary travel through three star systems. And someone is    sure to pay handsomely for anything that could break their hold.  
Of   course, anything valuable is also dangerous. The Kindom, the  ruling   power of the star systems, is inextricably tied up in the  Nightfoots’   monopoly—and they can’t afford to let Jun expose the truth.  They task   two of their most brutal clerics with hunting her  preternaturally stoic   Chono, and brilliant hothead Esek, who also  happens to be the heir to   the Nightfoot empire.  
But Chono and Esek are haunted in turn by a   figure from their shared  past, known only as Six. What Six truly wants   is anyone’s guess. And  the closer they get to finding Jun, the surer   Chono is that Six is  manipulating them all.  
​It's a game that could destroy their lives and devastate the stars.  And they have no choice but to see it through to the end.

1711454054.0,Red Rising Confusion,"I find myself quite confused about Red Rising. Not the plot of course, but the book in general. A few weeks back I was looking for fantasy/sci-fi to read, and of course went online for recommendations. And of course Red Rising appeared A LOT. I have never seen a book with so much praise. Hundreds and hundreds of people calling it one of their favorite books EVER. I was quite excited. I went and bought it eagerly, and read through the first half and… DNF. I tried again a few weeks later and again… DNF. I have never been so confused about mountains of praise for a book that I just couldn’t seem to enjoy despite my best efforts.

1) the whole color thing seemed so cringy right out of the gate. Like a very YA idea for a book that just felt forced and cliche in all the worst ways.

2) I was told the book was dark at times, and while I don’t doubt it, the writing itself is sooo YA. Everything felt cliche as YA often does, the characters were 1 dimensional (another YA issue), and the good guys/villains are so black and white that it is painful.

3) The main character is so poorly written. Such a Mary Stu, perfect, kind of guy that has to have trauma in his life to grow I guess. (Again, going back to the cliche, YA style of writing.)

4) I know that fans of this book HATE this comparison, but I’m just throwing it out there… it feels like a much worse version of Hunger Games. (And I don’t even like Hunger Games to begin with, so not great)

5) Everyone says the books get so much better, but I honestly just can’t imagine it. The setting might change, the world might get bigger, the the problems above would still exist.

Please know I’m not trying to be mean to anyone. And there really is nothing wrong with YA (not my preferred thing, but more power to everyone else) I’m just wondering if anyone feels the same as me? Or, if any fans can explain to me the positives and why I should push through a 3rd try, because I want to like it, I really do.",Fantasy

1711460147.0,First Time Bingo Card Review 3/5,"11. Self published-On Fragile Waves E. Lily Yu. 4/5. A-


 This was on the list of AMA from r/fantasy, but what fantasy elements there are are very light. This is a bitterly sad look into the refugees’ journey, tenuous citizenship, and intra-family struggles from the perspective of an Afghan child. There are short fairy tales scattered throughout, but the only element I’d consider fantasy is that the main character envisions a dead friend, speaking with her as a sort of embodiment of her subconscious, but also maybe real? I am still including it because I was impressed by the writing and appreciated what the author was trying to capture. About the only bit I didn’t like was the inclusion of a POV of college students teaching English to the kids, because it felt unnecessary, but that is wholly a nitpick. I believe this author has won a Hugo award, but fantasy or no, I’d read another book by her. Read if: you want a sad, but well-written short book about refugees. Don’t read if: you need happiness in your story; this one is pretty bleak.



12. Middle East by Middle East- The Immortals of Tehran by Ali Araghi. 4.5/5 A+


If you take nothing else away from this book, take this: don’t mess with cats. This is a magical realism book that follows a possibly cursed family across multiple generations throughout the tumultuous twentieth century of Iran marred by multiple revolutions, all of which are, of course, orchestrated by vengeful cats. I am probably biased, because I find Iran historically and culturally fascinating, but I loved this book. It primarily follows a MC who becomes mute after his father makes him assist in his suicide, but it does include different POVs from other family members and friends. This book took me a bit to get into it, but once I was in, I couldn’t put it down. I grew to really love the family, though they are far from perfect people. It also does a really excellent job of taking you through multiple revolutions, the toll they take, how activists view them, how ordinary people get by, etc. from the perspective of a prosperous family living through those difficult times. I really liked how he showed the different viewpoints across 4 generations to the same conflict and how those characters, or at least MC, changed over time. I found the MC to be just as selfish as some people around him suggest, but absolutely loved his mother, grandfather, and youngest daughter. Each character feels fully realized and most have some degree of character development. If you are confused by the cats part, it begins with a story about a family who sought shelter from a nation of cats and ended up killing their king, for which the cats vowed revenge and cursed the family. Honestly, I would have been fine reading this catless. It was an odd decision, probably some symbolism I’m missing, not to mention some jarring cruelty towards animals on rare occasion, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. More often, it just gives some delightful scenes of the serious patriarch of the family going deep down his conspiracy hole tracking and imprisoning cats to unveil their insidious plots. Like a lot of magical realism books, this reads closest to literary fiction so if that is not your jam I’d steer clear. If it is your jam, this is an excellently written multi-generational family drama spanning a fascinating historical period that I highly recommend.




13. Debut 2023 novel- The Jasad Heir by Sara Hashem. 3/5 B-



I guess this is my Middle East portion of reviews. OK, full disclosure, I chose to read this book largely because I have a daughter named Sylvia. Also, this writer is brand new so I will admit I was a bit torn between wanting to be kind and generous because writing is hard, criticism from strangers can hurt, and I feel a bit like an ass being critical in light of this, or judging her as if she was any other writer. I think I landed closer to the latter and I do indeed feel like a bit of an ass for it, but I chose to be more critical because I think she does have potential. Also, this was one of my later reads, so I do wonder if I am rating it lower due to making comparisons across my bingo card and saying “Ok. Well if that was a B, this has to be a bit lower.” I’d say this is a solid, but not spectacular book from a new writer. It’s a familiar trope, hidden royal with secret powers raised to be an elite fighter, but competently done. The characters were interesting if not necessarily complex. The language could be a bit of the overly formal pseudo-medieval speech that I often read in fantasy. It’s not too bad and something I find improves significantly over a writing career. The story is fairly standard fantasy story, but competently executed as well. I would say she avoided the worst pitfalls of new writing, the flaws are pretty common for new fantasy writers, and she did a solid, good job if not necessarily a standout. If you are someone like me who enjoys following authors from debut to watch how they grow, I think I’d read this book. On a side note, I listened to this on audible and while I actually didn’t love the performance, I do appreciate finding a voice actor more suitable to the setting. Nothing against the English accent but it does feel out of place sometimes reading a book set ostensibly in Africa or China or Egypt. Almost every country has a fair amount of English speakers, so it’s not like it should be hard to find. It’s a bit like having a Russian voice actor read a book about Kansas. Although B- may seem low, I think it should be taken in light of my B and A rankings. I say, well done for a first book. I look forward to her second and hope she continues to grow, though I believe she’s about to be a brand new lawyer so unless she completely forgoes sleep, I have no idea how she’ll find time to write.



14. Multiverse w/o portal (doors) His Dark Materials Phillip Pullman 5/5 S 


I don’t know if it’s allowed to review an entire series, but I binge read this so my individual thoughts are a bit blurred. This centers around a bold, clever, and deceptive girl raised by the masters at Jordan college when her world is turned upside down as kids begin going missing, her uncle becomes hunted by the all-powerful church for his research into “Dust”, and she is given a magical device only she seems to be able to operate (well). A battle across worlds is forming and she seems to be a key figure. This was a reread. I first read this series when I was about 12 and loved it, but wanted to see if it holds up. Though I didn’t cry at the ending this time and mope around for about a week, if anything, I am more impressed by his world building now and I will defend to the death that any series containing a race of people who ride dragonflies is worth reading. I really appreciated daemons as both clever that anyone aspiring to write a book for a younger audience should include what is essentially an online personality quiz (ahem, Hogwarts houses), but also really fascinating world-building where daemons (the soul) is an external person and yet also your truest self. Also, not to stir any pots, but did J.K. Rowling rip dementors off this series? These days, I usually find myself wishing books had been trimmed down a bit. For this series, however, I found myself really wishing more was fleshed out with more exploration of the world and development of side characters. I was surprised that my memory of characters was actually much more detailed than they actually were, but probably just my younger imagination filling gaps. Despite this, the character development and the characters themselves are absolutely exceptional—particularly Lyra, Lord Asriel, and Mrs. Coulter. He managed to make an adolescent girl both seem like a real adolescent girl and be a very enjoyable, complex character. Not an easy task. I also think that the romantic subplot in this series is one of the better I have read in YA even if I didn’t cry this time through. Now, as to the flaws. The only major flaw I found, and this one drove me crazy reading as an adult, was that the philosophy is shallow and cartoonishly anti-Catholic. I see this listed as the atheist counter to Narnia. This is more on par with an atheist counter to 90s Christian Alt-Rock praise music. Now, to be fair, this is a YA series, so I don’t ordinarily go in expecting great philosophical depth—the bad guys are often cartoonishly evil, but it’s a little different if you make pretty explicit allusions to a current institution. It’s a shame too, because he actually writes far more complexity in things like his characters than you usually find in YA. This doesn’t get very heavy-handed until the last book though. I will caveat this by saying that my standards of philosophy in fantasy may be set a bit high as I tend to find both pro and anti-religion in fantasy to be fairly shallow and I have a deep loathing for straw man arguments even if it were in support of my own views/beliefs/ideology. All in all, this is still absolutely worth reading. I still give it a 5/5. The storytelling in these books is fantastic, the world building is absolutely exceptional, easily one of the best I have ever read,  and the characters are complex and interesting enough that I’d be happy with standalone books following side characters. Read if: you like world building and complex characters, well-executed adolescent characters, you like fantasy (I’d give this a general worth a read recommendation), you are an atheist in need of a vigorous, self-satisfying pat on your back. Don’t read if: you despise YA, you are a very sensitive Catholic. 



15. Futuristic person of color, author of color- The Fifth Season by N. K. Jemisin. 4/5 A



 OK. I did it. I survived second person. Man am I glad I did. This book follows a child, young woman, and grieving mother with special powers based on sensing and controlling the earth in a land wracked by frequent earthquakes. They are treated like demons by their own people and those who are not killed in childhood may come to an organization that trains and uses them like tools and valuable slaves, though they never call them that. It’s hard to go into more detail than that without spoiling. This was a great mix of fantasy and dystopian futurism. It’s a book where the mystery you want to solve is the nature of the world, with a satisfying magic system and a well-crafted world-building that Jemisin has the maturity to reveal slowly, keeping interest through both the reveal and compelling characters. I will admit, I had a little trepidation going into this book after reading some reviews talking about ideology and how important this was. I thought, “Oh boy. Here we go. Another author who thinks they’re the first person to discover racism or misogyny is bad.” Refreshingly, it was not. Nor was it a MC with modern sensibilities thrown into a pseudo-medieval world hopping up and down, yelling and pointing, “Look! Bad! Bad! Look! Look!“ She managed to handle a topic such as slavery subtly and yet powerfully, if not deeply. I do wish there was a bit more world-building into the society, and this is a world that feels very small though that may be intentional. However, I expect it will continue to flesh out further into the series. Still, I think this is generally worth getting to at least the 1/3 point before putting it down if it’s just not for you.

1711459304.0,Para's Proper Reviews: Carved from Stone and Dream by T. Frohock,"Yes, I just might be back :) I've been away from reviewing and book spaces for a long time now due to health issues, but I'm feeling well enough to read and review. Hopefully it holds!
  
---  
Whew! This was one of the most stressful books I ever read. The whole series is some of the best historical fantasy out there and *Carved from Stone and Dream* is no different. But WOW it does not pull any punches. Funnily enough, I originally got it as an ARC, but even though I was sure it was going to be good, I avoided it for ages because I wasn’t in the right headspace for something as anxiety-inducing as the summary implied. Some books just need the right moment.

Los Nefilim are in trouble. After Franco’s forces under Jordi’s oversight take control of Catalonia, they are forced to split up and retreat to France. Diago and Guillermo with two escorts take a secret journey through the Pyrenees, while Miquel, Rafael, Ysabel, Juanita, and others join the mortal Spanish refugees crossing the border. They plan to meet up in Paris, but treachery lies everywhere and soon everything goes disastrously wrong.

And it’s insanely intense. The protagonists are constantly in mortal danger with never a moment of rest. And the author pulled off the breakneck pacing *perfectly*. It’s never disjointed and the stakes feel as high as they should. The ending, too, was just the right mix of ominous about what comes next and relieving some of the tension.

Another thing I really admire is how seamlessly Frohock blends history and magic. Speculative historical fiction can often break suspension of disbelief because the real and speculative elements do not blend seamlessly and the made up parts feel tacked on, or it makes you wonder why, if there is magic, it did not change the course of history. But in the whole *Los Nefilim* series, the inclusion of angels and daimons and nefilim feels quite organic. And for those interested in the time period, there’s a list of non-fiction books in the end 😁  
  
I’m not sure what’s the point of writing a full review for a middle book in the series when I didn’t do so for any of the others, but I highly recommend it, and I hope I find the mood and the time to finish the series soon.

1711458122.0,"Reading The Big Book of Cyberpunk, Week 9","Welcome to **Reading The Big Book of Cyberpunk**!

Each week we (u/FarragutCircle and u/fanny_bertram) will be reading 5-ish stories from Jared Shurin’s *The Big Book of Cyberpunk*, which includes a curated selection of cyberpunk stories written from 1950 to 2022! We’ll include synopses of the stories along with links to any legally available online versions we can find. Feel free to read along with us or just stop by and hear our thoughts about some cyberpunk stories to decide if any of them sound interesting to you.

**“P” by Yun Ko-eun** (published 2011, translated from Korean by Sean Lin Halbert)

Living in P City, Chang’s entire life is centered around the company and he’s forced to participate in a medical trial that leads to a strange jellyfish-like endoscope being stuck inside him.

* **Farragut’s thoughts:** Yun is a South Korean author whose most recent book (in English) is [The Disaster Tourist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42366547-the-disaster-tourist). This short story about a man living in a company town (really a city) started out really interesting, with a Kafka-esque plot as Chang struggled to get the “endoscope” jellyfish out of him and which mysteriously starts to grow inside him. He starts the story already alienated from his family (now living in New Jersey of all places—no offense to any New Jerseyites reading this), and becomes estranged from his work and his company, too. A chance encounter with his doctor towards the end of the story really highlighted the lengths Chang would sink to return to normalcy, but the final scene was incredibly bizarre and I can’t wait to see what Fanny thinks of this.

* **fanny’s thoughts:** This is the story for a man living entirely in a company town and the company essentially runs his life. The company coerces everyone into taking an endoscope and since it doesn't pass Chang has a “jellyfish” shape stuck in him. As the jellyfish evolves Chang becomes more and more estranged from his work and everything. Yeah the ending is bizarre and weird and I am not sure how I feel about it. Also, I hate tentacles. 

**“I Can Transform You” by Maurice Broaddus** (2013; also available in his collection of the same name)

Private detective Mac’s undercover cop ex-girlfriend is mysteriously killed and he and the cyborg cop Ade struggle to find her killer in a dystopian Midwestern city.

* **Special Guest Wish:** I was interested in many of the stories when Farragut solicited the mod team for guest spots on this big book read. Cyberpunk is generally very interesting to me because I particularly enjoy the inherent political-ness. I ended up choosing this story because, years ago, I DNFd one of Broaddus's early novels. I had picked up his [“King Arthur in Indianapolis” retelling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7163878-king-maker), and it was FAR too dark for me. But, the greater themes stuck with me. I've written off authors for less than what I read in *King Maker*, but I've always intended to give Broaddus another chance. And this story absolutely delivers. There is certainly the race consciousness I expected, given his work I was familiar with. There is absolutely every beat of a noir private detective story. There's the half turn to dystopia that's the hallmark of cyberpunk. And then there's so much more. I'm not sure that I loved it, but I will definitely be thinking about it for a while. And I'll certainly reread it, I suspect it will reward that. I think it does what it set out to do very effectively, though it takes a different direction in doing so than what it initially looks and feels like.

* **Farragut:** I’ve been very hit or miss with Broaddus, but this was a big hit for me. *I Can Transform You* was a fun cyberpunk story--in a lot of ways it's quite cliched and over the top, but that was both on purpose and quite entertaining. I liked the revelation of what was going on behind the case, and it was quite strange (the murderer was caught, but they did nothing to stop the larger threat!).

* **fanny:** This story was so over the top that I did not really appreciate it at the beginning. It was a really interesting take on cyberpunk. While it has a lot of the standard tropes used in the genre, it is very fun. 

**“Be Seeing You” by Madeline Ashby** (2015; also excerpted from her novel *Company Town*) ([link to story](https://www.vice.com/en/article/aekd9b/be-seeing-you-5886b737aa0e2845abcf8219))

Hwa has been hired as a bodyguard for an all-seeing, all-knowing company, but she still has connections she needs to protect.

* **Farragut:** Ashby is an American writer who moved to Canada and is also known for her Machine Dynasty trilogy. This story is apparently a standalone-ish chapter from her novel [*Company Town*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20447745-company-town), though this chapter is a great capsule of some of the cyberpunk issues. Hwa has no implants, unlikely everyone else, and this technological future also comes with a side of omnipresent surveillance by the company, not that that negates the need for bodyguards. Her boss apparently also has nothing better to do than to spy on her all day, which led to amusement on my part. I presume the full book would be clearer on the exact “company town” scenario, but I found it pretty engaging and am likely to pick up the book.

* **fanny:** I was a little confused why Hwa does bodyguard-related activities when there is omnipresent surveillance. Hwa’s boss essentially keeps track of everything about her and has nothing else to do which is amusing. It is an interesting exploration of someone with no implants living in a world full of it. It also shows the differences well with Hwa and her boss, but it doesn't feel complete. 

**“Keeping Up With Mr. Johnson” by Steven S. Long** (2016; also available in the anthology *World of Shadows* edited by John Helfers)

A corporate stooge who goes by Mr. Johnson joins the shadowrunners on a heist.

* **Farragut:** In terms of storytelling and cyberpunkitude, I liked the earlier Shadowrun story we read from [Week 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1aq2jko/reading_the_big_book_of_cyberpunk_week_3/), but “Keeping Up with Mr. Johnson” was also just *fun*. Tons of action, and a heist gone wrong, and an interesting protagonist. I’m not as familiar with Shadowrun as Shurin appears to be, but you can easily pick out who would be the RPG players and the fact that we’re following an NPC is just amusing.

* **fanny:** Huh, I did not realize this was related to something else we read. My favorite part of this story was the different fantasy races and mages all working together, at least temporarily. The corporate stooge needs a job done and hires a team. They are trapped in a swamp area and the person we follow facilitates the plot, but isn't the main character which was fun. This was very fun and I think it was all corporate espionage, but that was the least important part of the story. 

**“Flyover Country” by Tim Maughan** (2016) ([link to story](https://www.vice.com/en/article/78kqkd/flyover-country))

The narrator sneaks an SD card full of photos for an imprisoned man working slave labor for Foxconn.

* **Farragut:** This story was originally published in November 2016 as a possible future after that election in the US. It’s very short, and good, and uses a lot of good cyberpunk attitudes, especially where greed and hate overlap.

* **fanny:** This story was very short and still packed in a lot. I really liked seeing cyberpunk take on the overlap of corporate greed and hate. I found this one too real of a possible future. I also appreciated that it showed that some level of management would have to be involved to achieve this smuggling of chips through the process. It was more realistic and made it feel more fraught with danger.

That’s it for this week! Check back the same time next week where we’ll be reading and discussing ""Darkout"" by E. Lily Yu, ""2045 Dystopia"" by Ryuko Azuma, ""Thoughts and Prayers"" by Ken Liu, ""Somatosensory Cortex Dog Mess You Up Big Time, You Sick Sack of S\*\*T"" by Minister Faust, and ""The Life Cycle of a Cyber Bar"" by Arthur Liu.

**Self Published: Sweep of the Heart by Ilona Andrews**

Dina and Sean’s attempt at domestic happiness is interrupted when Sean’s mentor is kidnapped by an old enemy of Dina’s. The Inns of Earth are run by the Innkeepers, who keep Earth open as a waystation for numerous alien species in return for keeping Earth neutral ground and the citizens unaware of the rest of the galaxy. Innkeepers have magical abilities to bond with their inns and treat the laws of physics as guidelines within their inns. In return for information they agree to host the Spouse Hunt for the Emperor of the Dominion. Thus follows a reality TV show with the final ten spouses. At this rate Dina is going to get a reputation for running dangerous events no other innkeepers will touch. As well as being glorious action/adventure romance stories, the Innkeeper series are also funny. In no particular order, this book has a sapient fish having a nervous breakdown, sapient murderous trees shown documentaries of beaver dam building, a pirate ship trying to nuke a building from space, multiple assassins, a sphinx who used a junior book of riddles and a debate on why we are here in which the participants spent half an hour unable to even agree on the parameters of ‘here’. For long term fans of the series, a lot of information is given on the backstory of the inn’s permanent guest Calendia the galactic tyrant who murdered her brother as well as a few more details on Dina’s missing parents and their missing inn. A fun series I recommend.

**Middle East SF: Baba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn by Danielle Ackley-McPhail & Day Al-Mohamed**

A delightful retelling of Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves in a steampunk setting. Ali is an apprentice artificer who inherits a mysterious puzzle box which embroils him in a family secret duty which others are willing to kill him to usurp and maintain the status quo. Along the way he must deal with his greedy brother and growing affection for the Djinn of the title. I loved this story. It’s full of love for traditional middle eastern settings and steampunk. Ali himself is an unusual protagonist by modern standards for his unceasing piety in Islam which I enjoyed. It added nicely to the atmosphere and his character as a man who strives to do the right thing at all times, even when it contradicts his passion for artificing. Despite it being a retelling it comes across as a unique story to my Western eyes, and I recommend it for that reason.

&#x200B;

**Published in 2023: The Saint of Bright Doors by Vajra Chandrasekera**

I did like this book but must admit it was exceedingly weird. Fetter, raised by his cultist mother to kill his father who is one of the top ten messiahs in the world, has grown up and decided to ignore his destiny. He lives in the modern city of Luriat, full of ‘bright doors’ which all the cities doors turn into if they are left closed too long. He joins a support group for other almost chosen ones, or not chosen ones, or chosen ones who rejected their destiny and soon gets caught up in a revolution of the chaotic city as well as several subterfuges. But neither of his parents are done with him yet, despite his best efforts to forge his own identity. I’d advise everyone to give it a go but if you find it too weird early on I wouldn’t persist because it only gets weirder

&#x200B;

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities: The King of Faerie by AJ Lancaster**

The fourth in the Stariel quartet, a delightful book about Hetta who became the Lord of Stariel in the first and her love interest Wyn, a faerie prince from the Fae Realm. At the start of the series the borders between the fae realm and mortal realm have been come down after 300 years, giving the new Lord of Stariel a lot more to worry about than the problems of being magically connected to a sentient land that urgently needs better management. This book deals mostly with Hetta and Wyn trying to find the High King of Faerie so they can marry, a date they urgently need to set thanks to their impending parenthood. Loose plot threads involving Wyn’s Court of Ten Thousand Spires which has been without a ruler thanks to actions in previous books as well as the war between the Court of Ten Thousand Spires and the Court of Dusken Roses are tied up. More impressively, the book also answers questions I hadn’t thought to ask, such as why the borders between Fae and Mortal went up in the first place, the truth behind the numerous peculiarities of Wyn’s family and why the High King is so elusive. Lancaster sticks the landing of this story beautifully and I recommend the Lord of Stariel Quartet for all fans of fantasy, romance, mystery and action.

**POC Author: Children of Virtue and Vengeance by Tomi Adeyami**

The second of her Children of Blood and Bone series. Adeyami has excellent worldbuilding and magic systems. I am invested enough in this series to want to know how it ends. But this fantasy series was written as a way of channeling her rage about racial police brutality and it shows. It’s awfully grim and depressing, the way both sides of the conflict persist in thinking of and doing the worst to each other and keep missing chances for peace. I also found the teenage characters irritating, constantly doing something they had been told not to do, doing it anyway, then feeling miserable about how it all went wrong. Just about every happy point in the series seem to only be there to make the inevitable future misery gut punch worse, and the whole thing ended on a cliffhanger so a lot of my issues with interpersonal relationships I cannot decide are issues or not yet because it depends on how the story ends. A pity, the first one was so good.",Fantasy

The Queen's Poisoner. **Title with a Title**

Cute little fairy-tale-type story told from a child's point of view.

&nbsp;

Turbulence.  **Superheroes**

All the people who were on a random commercial airline flight are found to have developed superpowers.  Some are cool about it, some are not.

&nbsp;

Dark Ascension. **Bottom of the TBR**

Morally outraged that these books didn't do well on the market.  I have been saving this book for years because it's the last in the series and the author has said the series will never be finished because publishers won't pay her to write the rest of it.  This book is urban fantasy for people who don't like urban fantasy.  It skips both the angst and the hyper-masculinity.  Anyway try it out (but start with the first one, Generation V, not to be confused with the new TV show Gen V).

&nbsp;

The Night Tiger. **Magical Realism**

Magical realism isn't my thing but the plot and the relationships between the characters made this book pretty good.  Only complaint is >!did not like her love interest pressuring her to have sex, that was pretty gross.!<

&nbsp;

Court of Fives. **Young Adult**

How I imagine this book getting written is Kate Elliott, a writer with Robin Hobb-like character-writing skills, is approached about writing a YA book.  They offer her a bunch of cash, and she agrees.  They tell her it has to fit the current YA stereotype: talented underdog girl living in dystopia enters competitive event with high stakes, with of course the luv triangle between handsome royalty and handsome bad boy.  Elliott just wants to get paid.  So she puts zero thought into the competitive event (must have turned the TV on that evening and seen American Ninja Warrior), comes up with a super bland royalty love interest and rather than slowly develop the romance just tells him and the MC ""Now kith,"" apparently got bored and couldn't be bothered to develop the bad boy side of the triangle so just sticks him into the book ""Hi I'm a rude criminal"" and skips the romance part, slaps a cover on the book and fucks off with bags of money.  Buuuuut...Elliott just can't help herself and into the middle of this pile of mediocre she drops an INCREDIBLY INTERESTING AND FLAWED father and a saint-like mother with hints at more beneath the surface. I tell you I stayed up past my bedtime, I was that engaged.  I am so curious about what will happen in the sequels.  Will I suffer as Elliott indulges herself in her favorite pastime of making me really really care about the characters, and then tormenting them mercilessly?  Or will she remember that she's in it for the sweet YA cash and the opening scene of the next book is gonna be the MC trying on a beautiful new dress for a ball?

Andrea Vernon and the Corporation for Ultrahuman Protection.  **Mundane Jobs**

This is the antithesis of 'Hench;' MC is an administrative assistant for a corporation that employs superheroes.  Fairly flippant and non-serious.  

&nbsp;

A Brother's Price.  **Published in the 2000's**

I'm still not sure if this book was a masterful parody that whooshed right over my head, or an honest-to-god harem/reverse harem (it's confusing) that accidentally raised questions about the stereotypical societal roles of men and women.  It's a combo Wild West/British Royalty alternate reality where something like 10 to 15 women are born for every one man.  In this reality, women run everything and men do as they're told, raise the children, keep the household, and get married to entire families of sisters.  Like one man will marry 10 women sisters (not his own!!!).  The MC was too meek for my tastes not to mention that one of the sisters he marries is a predator (which again makes me think parody), but I had so many questions I felt like I had to include it on my card.

&nbsp;

Today is Too Late.  **Angels and Demons**

MC is an anti-hero. He's the right-hand man to a conquering tyrant.  The MC doesn't really have a change of heart so much as do a favor out of unrequited (or not?) love. There's a lot of battle scenes and cool necromantic beasts.   

&nbsp;

**Five Short Stories**

The Home Crowd Advantage (Ben Aaronovitch)

Mr. Death (Alex E. Harrow)

Cat's Meat (Robin Hobb)

Defending Elysium (Branden Sanderson)

A Kisian Christmas (Devin Madson)

Every year, the short story category shows up on the card like a pile of bird droppings.  It's easier to deal with a disliked category if I at least know I won't have to do it again next year.  This year I took a different approach: I made a list of authors whose books I love, and then checked to see if they had any short stories.  It's not really within the spirit of ""reading something you normally wouldn't"" buuuuut I wouldn't read short stories if my arm weren't getting twisted, so you get what you get.  
&nbsp;

The Luminous Dead.  **Horror**

Hell no, I HATE HORROR.  I don't like feeling scared, I don't like gruesome deaths, I don't like reading books where I know there's a pretty good chance things will not end well.  This sci-fi book I guess qualifies as an atmospheric horror book.  It's the only one I read for this category because I wasn't going to take a chance on trying another one and getting some awful image stuck in my head for the rest of my days.  There are only two characters, and they communicate via radio for the majority of the book, only meeting in person at the very end.  The author still managed to keep my interest despite the slim cast.  I think people who enjoy true stories about climbers and explorers might like this book.

&nbsp;

The Traitors We Are. **Self Published/Indie Publisher**

This was a gem.  I really liked it.  There are multiple viewpoints and three MCs.  There is magic, but not much--it's more about sword-fighting and politicking (but not tedious politicking because the three MCs could not be more useless at intrigue if they tried the poor things).  The cast feels nice and fleshed out, the conversations between characters are interesting, and the MCs have differing goals.  Definitely going to read the sequel.  

&nbsp;

This Woven Kingdom. **Set in the Middle East**

MC is a maid and seamstress who is hiding her magical genie powers, but accidentally comes to the attention of royalty, some which want to kill her, some of which want to kiss her.  This book was good but it ends on a cliff-hanger and I cannot recommend the sequel because >!it adds a love-triangle element and the MC spends many an agonizing chapter alternately arguing with and comforting the bad boy, who has KIDNAPPED her; for me this was too tedious and I DNF'd the sequel.  It had become far more romance than fantasy!<.

&nbsp;

The Book that Wouldn't Burn.  **Published in 2023**

I really liked the first 25% of this book.  Vivid description of the world, peppy MC, element of mystery.  Then the time skips hit and it started dragging.  It is tough to keep the dramatic tension when skipping forward several years at a time.  My other complaint, and this is totally a personal taste thing, is >!I'm very rarely a fan of time travel or plots where the world ends and this has both.  I know the MC has basically escaped into one of the alternate realities, but it kind of feels like the stakes are lowered now since she'll always have that as an out!<.

&nbsp;

There Is No AntiMemetic Division.  **Multiverses**

Interesting concept of a modern-day government organization that investigates and contains beings that eat your memory.  If you liked the Thursday Next books or The Rook/Checquy books, you might like this.  

&nbsp;

Blood over Bright Haven.  **POC Author**

Genius academic magic-working MC in an Industrial Revolution-type setting where most people are confined to a single city.  I mostly liked it and >!I always appreciate an author with the guts to have their MC take the nuclear option.  It did deprive me of my 100% happy ending but it was pretty darn satisfying that she took out the whole corrupt government with her!<.

&nbsp;

The Wolf of Oren-Yaro.  **Book Club or Readalong Book**

 Queen travels to a foreign country to re-unite with her wayward king.  Some basic sword-fighting and shenanigans against a more complicated backdrop of why her political power is, for multiple reasons, hobbled.  This is one of the few fantasy MCs I've read about that has a child, even though the child is off-screen for the entirety of the book.  >!She better ditch that horrible deadbeat husband of hers ASAP in the next book; I cannot believe she is still even a little on the fence after the threat to her child!<.

&nbsp;

The Sea and Little Fishes.  **Novella**

I already read short stories and now you want me to do a novella too?  I followed my Short Story tactic and just read a novella by an author I already knew I liked, Terry Pratchett.  It was about Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg so obviously it was dope.

&nbsp;

The Skinner.  **Mythical Beasts**

I totally cheated on this card.  There are a ton of extremely creative beasts/animals/monsters/what-have-you in this sci-fi world, but they bear no resemblance to anything in fairy tales or mythology.  The book was so good though, I had to include it.  Multiple viewpoints and the plot moves quickly without ever seeming hurried.  We got sentient AIs, we got mercenaries, we got deep-sea fisherman, we got awful people-farming aliens, loving it all.  >!if you've read this book, who was your favorite character and why was it Sniper?!<

&nbsp;

A Shadow Bright and Burning.  **Elemental Magic**

Wow I did not think this square was going to be so hard.  But it was.  It was so hard.  I'd already read a fair amount of the top choices for elemental magic so Sanderson, Schwab, Butcher, etc were not options.  The remaining choices all had significant romance elements.  I could not for the life of me find a book with elemental magic that was well-written and didn't have its MC spending an inordinate amount of time mooning over someone.  I DNF'd multitudes.  I made it all the way through a Sharon Shinn one but was extremely grossed out by >!the MC being OK with the infertile king having a harem of wives whom he blindfolds to let other men have sex with so he can have 'heirs,'!< so I didn't want to include it on the card.  Instead we have this book, a verge-of-the-industrial-revolution England where sorcerers use elemental powers to ward off god-like monsters.  Unfortunately for me it contains not just a love triangle but a love square.

&nbsp;

How Rory Thorne Destroyed the Multiverse.  **Myths and Retellings**

Sci-fi retelling of Sleeping Beauty that takes a sharp left-turn in the middle of the fairy blessing scene and never returns to the confines of the archetype after that.

&nbsp;

The Bone Shard Daughter.  **Queernorm setting**

 Interesting world.  The pacing is good.  My main complaint, which is fairly minor, is that >!the plot armor was too thick so by the end it almost felt like a Cozy fantasy, especially with the cute fuzzy sentient animal sidekick!<.  

&nbsp;

Gullstruck.  **Coastal Setting**

This was different-feeling book!  MC is a child but I would not consider this a children's book or even a YA book.  Fairly unique hook to start us off.  A villain I truly hated.  The narration felt slightly removed from the intensity of what was happening, which was probably good because >!the description of her village being murdered was heart-rending and felt much more real than a lot of other fantasy-death-scenes I've read, even without being as graphic.!<

&nbsp;

The Jasmine Throne.  **Druid**

Hands-down had the most vivid opening scene of the whole bingo card.  >!When she said ""My brother, I will not forget"" I got chills.!<  This was a long book and while not everything was wrapped up at the end, a lot of the important things were so it felt very satisfying.  There are two MCs and multiple other POVs, but most of the book was seen through the MCs' eyes.  Setting is kind of a pre-industrial India.  We have evil emperor, rebels, plant magic that may or may not be evil, prophesies, and good solid writing.  >!Priya and Malini were the MCs but my favorite character was Bhumika, what a fricking bad-ass, and kept her compassion the whole time!<.

&nbsp;

The Alchemy of Stone.  **Features Robots**

Industrial revolution world but with gargoyles, self-aware robots, and magical chemistry.  This book had good writing but was too bleak for me, just a matter of preference.  Not grimdark, more bleakly intellectual.  >!jesus the level of domestic abuse suffered by the poor MC was terrifying, I could have put this on my Horror square and felt OK about it.  Also how you gonna put her through all that and then not have things work out for her at all!<.

&nbsp;

Prince's Gambit.  **Sequel**

The problem with this book is that you had to read the first book to get to it, and the first book was rooooouuuuugh.  I had bounced off it in years past but for whatever reason got through it this year and the sequel made it worth-while.  Plot is smut, extremely well-done political intrigue, some fighting, and a love interest who's walk-out music would definitely be DJ Khaled ""All I do is win.""",Fantasy

1711446471.0,Is there a book where nobles maintain a conspiracy that only they can use magic?,"I'm looking for book recommendations on a rather specific premise.

A feudal fantasy where the ruling noble class maintain a conspiracy that magic is hereditary and only they of noble blood are able to use it which gives them their divine right to rule over the puny mortal peasants. But the truth is the art of sorcery is not hereditary, maybe talent for it is, but the capacity to use magic is inherent to everyone and only needs proper training and materials to unlock it.

The plot is centred on the protagonists discovering this truth and trying to bring it to light and upend the balance of power.",Fantasy

1711431219.0,Academy Romance- Reverse Harem,"Hello Beautiful People!

I am looking for a series where the FMC thinks she is human and doesn’t know if the existence of supernaturals. She ends up at an academy for supernaturals (I’m not super picky with how that happens). I don’t need her harem to be fated mates although it is preferred but I do need them to not bully her (I don’t mind if they aren’t super friendly to start with). I would like the FMC to have like unprecedented power or a power that has not existed for centuries (basically the “chosen one” trope, however that may be). I do prefer larger harems and that her men are of different supernatural species but again neither are requirements. I do love a shy, innocent, traumatised FMC, and I LOVE it when her men are her sage space where she can heal and be herself but again again not a requirement.

1711429019.0,Discussion about Powerless and An Ember in the Ashes,"Is Powerless just like An Ember in the Ashes? I keep finding similarities.

Hey everyone,

I just finished An Ember in the Ashes, the entire series and I started reading Powerless by Lauren Roberts, only 23 pages in, and I see a lot of similarities between the books that I’m wondering if I should even read this at all.

For instance, the way Paedyn describes the Ordinaries makes it sound a lot like Laia and the scholar slaves, oppressed by the Empire, which is what the Kingdom in Powerless sounds like so far. 

Kai is introduced and he is to hopefully be the “Enforcer” which its description sounds a lot like the Blood Shrike position in An Ember in the Ashes.

There are the trials coming up apparently and even in the beginning on An Ember in the Ashes, there were trials to decide who the Emperor and Blood Shrike will be. Just like who the Enforcer will apparently be in Powerless.

There’s the “Bitchy Blair” character just introduced and she sounds like Keris, although not exactly a leader within the kingdom like Keris was in An Ember in the Ashes. But I don’t quite know this character yet.

Also, according to the description. It says the people within the Kingdom, the Elites are the “hunters” and the Ordinaries are the “hunted”. In An Ember in the Ashes, the scholar slaves were hunted by the martials.

Finally, Kai is apparently thought of as the best Elite in decades. Just as Elias was apparently the finest soldier in the entire Empire. 

So many similarities and I’ve gathered these points from only about 20 pages. 

Does anyone else feel like this is a similar story? ",Fantasy

1711422878.0,Bingo '23 - Trans authors & trans characters,"This is my second year doing bingo, and I decided to tackle a theme this year! All these books either have a major canonically trans character (the main character, the love interest, or a POV character in an ensemble cast) AND/OR the author is trans. When it came to identities for authors, I selected specifically authors who have given significant interviews about it, or have that information easily available on social media, in press kits, etc. I did not go digging beyond that, as I want to respect the privacy of queer authors if they so choose. Please consider any information on author identity to be a non-exhaustive list, and please let me know if you catch anything I've gotten wrong :)

Please note mini reviews may contain mild spoilers - mostly in that sometimes the characters or their LIs are revealed to be trans midway through the story, meaning their presence on this list might be a spoiler in and of itself.

**Title Within a Title -**  [The Witch King by H.E. Edgmon](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/04f295bc-07e5-4acf-b374-8da1b5dd03e1) - 3.5/5 stars  
Trans man MC, trans author. A trans witch must return to the fae realm to face his traumatic past and the royal fiancé he left behind. This was an enjoyable read, if sometimes 'not for me' in the sense that I struggle with YA that feels like it's going to be dated fast (i.e., modern day references, slang, etc). This is also probably the only ""fated mates"" story I've ever personally enjoyed, simply because it changes the dynamic if they're gay and trans.

**Superheroes -** [Dreadnought by April Daniels](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a7e1f221-581d-426d-ba68-99cb72c5e3a7) **-** 3.5/5 stars  
Trans girl MC, trans woman author. A closeted trans girl inherits the powers of one of the most famous superheroes - transforming into her dream body as side effect. Danny is a delightful protagonist, and while I've never really been into superheroes before, this time around I understood why this can be such a compelling genre for stories about identity, society, and power. Thank you bingo for getting me to read books outside of my niche!

**Bottom of the TBR -** [PET by Akwaeke Emezi](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/63fdcc0c-b8ae-4872-9ad2-8866c05cca71) - 5/5 stars  
Trans girl MC, nonbinary author. Jam has always been told there are no more monsters, until a creature named Pet emerges from her mother's painting and tells her there's a shadow lurking in her best friend's house. As you can guess from my rating, I LOVED this one. There is a very powerful and expansive story packed into a short book, but it never felt rushed. Loved the worldbuilding, the characters, and the incredible writing. I don't know what else to say other than man, I wish I'd read this sooner, and I will absolutely be checking out their other novels.

**Magical Realism** - [Lakelore by Anna-Marie McLemore](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/550c6d2e-1a0f-4273-96b7-5634181511a2) - 4/5 stars  
Nonbinary MC, nonbinary LI, nonbinary author. Teen Bastián protects the magical world under the lake, until Lore Garcia finds their way into that space and changes everything. Both the MC and the LI are neurodivergent as well (dyslexia and ADHD). This one is as much about self love as anything else. The writing is very visceral, and even as someone who struggles to visualize what I'm reading, I left with a clear picture in mind. I at times work with queer and trans teens, and I've added this to my 'go to' list of books to recommend them.

**Young Adult -** [Iron Widow by  Xiran Jay Zhao](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8f403954-2950-4903-bdc3-cecb460279e2) - 2.5/5 stars  
Nonbinary author.  The boys of Huaxia dream of pairing up with girls to pilot Chrysalises, giant transforming robots that can battle mecha aliens - but the girls often die from the mental strain. This one was, unfortunately, my biggest disappointment for bingo. I was SO excited for this one, both because of the plot and the selling point of 'YA where the love triangle ends in polyamory'. Unfortunately, this just really wasn't for me. It felt very surface level #girlboss for me, and some of the writing is jarring in that it's very modern despite the setting.

**Modern Jobs -** [Finna by Nino Cipri](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/41b2094c-9169-4085-b68b-34f644ff7f67) - 5/5 stars  
Nonbinary author, nonbinary LI.  When an elderly customer at a big box furniture store slips through a portal to another dimension, it’s up to two minimum-wage employees (who only just broke up!) to track her across the multiverse and protect their company’s bottom line. Hilarious, anti-capitalist, queer novella about traveling through space and time (in IKEA). It's whimsical, bizarre, heartfelt, and I can't wait to read the next one.

**Published in the 2000s** - [The Red Tree by Caitlín R. Kiernan](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/d2f9c929-b009-4eca-80c6-0d103d963a4b) - 5/5 stars  
Genderfluid author. A paranoid author discovers an unfinished manuscript written by the house's former tenant, which focuses on the supernatural folklore surrounding the ancient oak growing on a desolate corner of the property. This was the hardest square for me given my theme, but someone on this very subreddit recommended this book! Unfortunately, I forgot who. If you're out there, thanks for the rec! I love creepy novels and unreliable narrators. I found this one very predictable, but that was actually part of what I enjoyed about it. The foreboding horror builds and looms throughout the book. Kiernan is a new to me author, and I definitely plan to check out some of their other works.

**Angels & Demons -** [Yours Celestially by Al Hess](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/a4d20cb0-fb90-44df-9565-03d3665bf06b) - 4.5/5 stars  
Trans author, nonbinary main character (in an ensemble cast).  Sasha has recently been resurrected, having died young from a heart attack (precipitated by addiction and drug use). Alongside the struggles of sobriety, divorce, and resurrection, he's plagued by the echoed feelings of his AI guardian angel...who has fallen in love with a soul in Limbo. I've read several of Hess' books now, and I love them all so far. He specializes in cozy, feel-good, queer sci fi/romance (and specifically, seems to enjoy plots where robots fall in love). This was another delightful read!

**5 SFF Short Stories -** [Your Body is Not Your Body: An Anthology](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/1b94a592-067d-4d5c-90da-85ffa6e89195) - 4/5 stars  
I believe every author involved in this anthology identified as trans or gender nonconforming, and many of the stories featured trans characters as well! Like all anthologies, this one has highs and lows. Overall, it's gruesome, frequently gory, and at times highly uncomfortable to read (in a good way). If you love body horror, which I very much do, I recommend this one.

**Horror -** [Tell Me I'm Worthless by Alison Rumfitt](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ad2249c7-db88-4898-9aa5-19ae8d9c4437)- 4/5 stars  
Trans woman MC, trans woman author. Alice spent the night in a haunted house with her two best friends three years ago, and things have never been the same since. This book is...fucked up and brutal. I went back and forth on my rating so many times, and I'm still not sure how I feel about it, or who I'd recommend it to. The haunted house is very much secondary to the horrors of the real world in this one. Additionally, it contains a graphic rape scene, which is something I usually try to avoid in literature. That being said, this novel has definitely stayed with me, and I felt the catharsis big time by the end.

**Self Published** - [Heart, Haunt, Havoc by Freydís Moon](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/12d3bd64-3993-4920-b45a-63437e839870) - 3/5 stars  
Trans MC, nonbinary MC, nonbinary author. An exorcist goes to a haunted house, where he falls in love with its owner. I remember enjoying this book; unfortunately, I don't remember a single thing about it now. I'll leave it at that.

**Set In the Middle East -** [The Map of Salt and Stars by Zeyn Joukhadar](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/656b4a42-1116-467d-b1d5-870b6d3fa067) - 5/5 stars  
Trans author. This story is really the intertwined tales of two young girls, set eight hundred years apart - a modern-day Syrian refugee seeking safety and a medieval adventurer apprenticed to a legendary mapmaker. The fantasy elements in this are very minimal, and they're only present in one of the two tales (the medieval one). That being said, this is a very visceral, visual, and heartrending novel. I actually cried at the end, which was embarrassing, because I was listening to the audiobook and actively out for a run when it happened. Fortunately, it was also raining, so I don't think my neighbors noticed.

**Published in 2023 -** [The Spirit Bares Its Teeth by Andrew Joseph White](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ba9a3fd4-d7d7-4a08-ae69-abe761bb026c) - 5/5 stars  
Trans MC, trans LI, trans man author. A trans autistic boy in an alternate Victorian era is sent to an all girls finishing school/sanatorium/horror show to ‘fix’ him. Also, he can speak to ghosts. Another one where the supernatural is far less horrifying than the horrors of society. Easy 5/5 stars for me, as this has so many elements I love - brutal and visceral body horror, queer resilience, queer anger, and hope.

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities** - [The Affair of the Mysterious Letter by Alexis Hall](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cbeaf53d-7ca2-4048-b59d-a78cc1a6d1a3)- 3.5/5 stars  
Trans MC. A Sherlock Holmes retelling where Watson is a trans man, Sherlock is a queer woman, and also they're traveling through time and space. Honestly, this one was just so bizarre and FUN.

**POC Author** - [Ninefox Gambit by Yoon Ha Lee](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/24ce970f-a9a3-437d-85f3-44efe858c923) - 4/5 stars  
Trans man author. Disgraced Captain Kel Cheris is given a chance to redeem herself by teaming up with the famously mad, undead tactician Shuos Jedao (and by teaming up, I mean letting his ghost hijack a ride in her body). Honestly, I just had to embrace not understanding a single thing for half this novel, but that paid off! I felt like I was solving a puzzle the entire time, spurred on by how much I enjoyed the characters.

**Book Club/Read-a-long Book -** [Dead Collections by  Isaac Fellman](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c47b2902-c213-4181-a4e1-1df13f08e171) - 2/5 stars  
Trans MC, trans LI, trans author. A trans vampire archivist falls for a grieving widow. This book was just okay, unfortunately. I wish we'd spent more time on the worldbuilding and the vampire lore, since that was the most interesting part of the book. I really didn't love the portrayal of butch lesbians (in that they were all either secretly trans men or transphobic, and sometimes both?). There is space for nuanced takes on the community, intersection, and interplay between butch lesbians and trans men but this...wasn't it. The writing is beautiful, but it couldn't save the book for me.

**Novella -** [You Always Cry at Endings by S.J. Whitby](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/0b637482-3ed7-456f-b9ed-9b094c306afc) - 4/5  
Nonbinary MC, nonbinary author. Described as a "" genrebent novella"", which is probably more fitting than any blurb I could come up with. It's like a bizarre fever dream, and it's all in second person. This one is super weird, and the ending was a bit rushed, but I sure had a lot of fun reading it!

**Mythical Beasts** - [The Hobgoblin Riot by Matt Dinniman](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f16074fe-b33c-4348-8ace-80619f19b95a) - 4/5  
Trans man MC (in an ensemble cast). Let me tell you all a story. Once upon a time, I read my first LitRPG book. It was Dominion of Blades by Matt Dinniman, and the main character was revealed to be a trans man. What a brilliant idea, I thought! Of course a genre that is about people entering VR or MMORPG inspired spaces would be a great place to include trans characters. After all, ""trans person cracking their egg via video games"" is a trope for a reason, right? Surely this is explored in many, many LitRPG books! The answer, of course, is that it is only explored in Dominion of Blades and it's sequel - The Hobgoblin Riot. I was devastated.

So, yes, this is a reread. It's not my first time rereading this book, and it won't be my last. I am not joking when I say my gf (who barely reads fantasy, let alone litRPG) knows Matt Dinniman's name because of how often I LAMENT that this series isn't completed yet. I know there are fellow Dungeon Crawler Carl fans on this subreddit, and I highly recommend Dominion of Blades as well. This is entirely for selfish reasons. Please, can we come together as a subreddit and ~~peer pressure~~ encourage Matt to finish this series someday? For me?

**Elemental Magic** - [The Wicked Bargain by Gabe Cole Novoa](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/886b06a0-3cfc-4ee2-b5be-04ef42e0c820) - 4/5  
Transmasculine MC,  transmasculine  author. This novel follows a nonbinary transmasculine pirate as they survive of the fallout of a devil's deal their father made for their life sixteen years ago. I find YA to be more hit or miss than other genres, but I loved this novel.  It encompasses found family, the euphoria of transition, the complexities of the MC's gender identity, and tells a great narrative about piracy without overwriting some of the harm famous pirates perpetuated. The audiobook is narrated by Vico Ortiz, so it also probably helps if you have a huge celebrity crush on them (I do).

**Myths and Retellings** - [Wrath Goddess Sing by Maya Deane](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c39c6018-2d91-4dfb-b164-d6737229f06e) - 3.5/5  
Trans woman MC, trans woman author. Achilles, but she's a trans woman. I'm grateful for bingo, because I would've DNF'd this one otherwise. If I had, I would've missed out on the back half of this book, which I really enjoyed. The first half less so, as I found it slow, dense, and pretty clumsy in how it handled slavery - and also I really, really struggled with the fact that there are super horny dolphins in here for seemingly no reason.

**Queernorm** - [The Black Tides of Heaven Tensorate by Neon Yang](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/44e2b58f-e22b-416e-a851-63c56123e212) - 3/5  
Nonbinary author. Several significant characters would be trans by our standards. In this world, all children are gender neutral by default, and choose/confirm their gender as they age. The story focuses on two twins, and a brewing rebellion. This was another book that was just okay, unfortunately, and I wanted it to be more. I have read time skip novellas and enjoyed them, but this one glossed over too much. I never felt invested, unfortunately, and I think this novella could've done with at least 50 more pages to flesh out plotlines and relationships.

**Coastal or Island Setting** - [Odder Still by D.N. Bryn](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/9939deda-b92d-496b-b23b-0a7b4e6f1e0c) - 3/5  
Trans LI, nonbinary author. A loner with a parasite bonded to his brainstem and a selkie take on an underwater steampunk city. Fun and fast paced - unfortunately, a little too fast paced (and insta-lovey), and it all kind of fell apart by the end. I think this book would've benefitted from more space to let the plot and the characters breathe. I'll likely still check out the sequel, as I'm attached to the characters now.

**Druids** - [Jack of Thorns by A.K. Faulkner](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/edec4b5a-80a0-4f71-9115-edfe4a25a6f9) - 1.5/5  
Agender author. A florist inadvertently summons a god and deals with the consequences, all while falling in love with an earl on the run from his past. Argh, I really want to rate queer books well honestly, but this one is just...not good. The LI refers to himself as ""one"" instead of ""I"" (as in ""one does not have such a device""), and he acts like he's been locked in a basement for the entirety of the modern age. It's also boring. I would've DNF'd this one if it weren't for bingo, but unlike the pleasant surprise in the back half of Wrath Goddess Sing, I was just left wishing I'd found a DIFFERENT druid book to read.

**Featuring Robots -** [A Psalm for the Wild-Built by Becky Chambers](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c64c1bdd-2ca5-442c-a45d-ea2ff00978bd) - 5/5  
Nonbinary MC, nonbinary secondary character. A slice of life about a tea monk and a robot trying to make sense of their lives. Becky Chambers never misses! I'm certainly projecting, but I'm going to rec this one to all my fellow healthcare friends. Intentional or otherwise, Dex sure seems to me like they're suffering a serious case of burnout in their role as a caregiver (a job you love, and derive meaning from, that still feels completely exhausting at times? so much so that you have to disappear into nature to cope?). Anyway, I always finish Chambers' books feeling so comforted.

**Sequel** - [The Barrow Will Send What it May by Margaret Killjoy](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/27d784d8-5300-49c4-9a99-96d34fd6c298) - 5/5  
Transfeminine author, multiple trans characters across the series. Punk fantasy about traveling anarchist turned demon hunter Danielle Cain and her crew. Killjoy is another author who I already know and love, so I was unsurprisingly delighted by this novella. The Danielle Cain novels are bad ass, imaginative, beautifully written, and marvelously fun. I highly recommend them. I would read countless books about this queer found family traveling through small town America to kick demon ass and evade cops together.",Fantasy
1711418582.0,"New to reading &  the wheel of time, I have 2 chapters left in The eye of the world. ","Ever since I started this book I havnt been able to stop thinking about it, and it has become a comforting story and world to fall into. As a first time reader with 0 idea of anything at all going into it i have been extremely suprised at just how much I am loving this book.

I have enjoyed the last 3 weeks of reading this book and i’ve been procrastinating finishing the last 2 chapters because i’m sad that it is ending and im nervous that the next books won’t live up to the first one. I already bought the whole series so im going to finish it but Im procrastinating it because i don’t want it to end. 

I’m a very nostalgic person so this reminds me of how I felt after my first read through of Lord of the rings as a kid of 13 & now that i’m aware of how fleeting that warm nostalgic feeling as a 27yo man, It makes me  cherish these moments so much. 

I was one of those guys who struggled a lot with school and never read again after i turned like 16, so it’s been over a decade since i’ve read a book and I am such a fantasy game nerd and movie nerd that the book genre contains so many stories that my mind has yet to experience, and in some ways I am traveling back in time to this undiscovered medium of reading and I stumble upon this wheel of time series that i’ve always heard about but never experienced and it all feels like it has come full circle.

In some ways this book has been therapeutic and “the wheel weaves as the wheel wills”

I guess this goes for all forms of fantasy, the escape, the imagination. whether it’s books, games, movies, comics, art, whatever.

my favorite quote from the book is: “it is the pleasure of a guest’s company that should be remembered, not the sadness of parting.”

this is such. a deep rooted lesson that I am also learning to be true as I grow older. it is beautiful how life can give you somthing as simple as a book and it can heal parts of you that you didn’t know were hurt. as we experience heart break, work stress, break ups, death, debt, and all the other realities of existence. 


anyways, i could go on, but im sitting here staring at my last 2 chapters of this book and I know I have 13 more books to read and im sure a bunch of other good book series, but i am just nervous they won’t live up to the first one.

im new to the community of books and wheel of time so im curious to see how you guys react to this type of post. judging on your ability to read alot of words(long books) this post should be right up your alley. 

anyways thank you reddit for listening to me as I become aware of my mortality. and realize how important and gratful i am.

i hope i never loose this part of me that loves nostalgia and fantasy and art and imagination. i was taught as a kid id grow out of it, here I am, a grown man with a good career and has walked through some amazing memories with equally as tough ones. and I still love it. i hope i do til i die. it gives life meaning in some weird way: the ability to be aware of just how special every moment is.

alright i’m done

thank you.",Fantasy
1711418572.0,I want to start looking for my next series now. But I'm annoyingly picky.,"I spent ages trying to find my current series, cause I'm annoying about what I like, so I want recommendations now.

Basically, I have a bit of a love affair with the Wheel of Time, but I'm only still quite new to actually *reading* and the fantasy/sci-fi space. I started WoT when I was a kid, and have reread it every few years until RJ passed away. Then I thought it would never be finished, and it somehow came as a huge shock to me two years ago (after not reading for like a decade) that Sanderson had completed it. So, I started it again, finished it, felt a gap in my life, and ended up reading it again. When I finished the second time, I tried a whole bunch of other series that I'll detail below, and then found The Stormlight Archive - Sanderson, which has now become a new favorite. And now, so that I don't have to struggle with nothing in my life while I look for a new book, I'm searching while I still have a book and a half to go in my current series.

&#x200B;

* I started off with Mistborn - didn't care about the characters, and the magic system felt like I was being explained how to play a video game. So even though the magic system and world was quite good, I quit half way through book 1.
* I started the first Terry Pratchett book, and quit in Chapter 1, cause I did't like the humor (don't come for me!)
* I redid the Harry potter series, and that was okay, though I certainly felt my age reading them, but I liked the familiar feel to it I guess.
* I finished the first Malazan book, and honestly hated it. The style wasn't what I want in a series at all, and I never ended up liking any character except Kruppe.
* I ended up reading The Martian - Andy Weir, which I finished in about a day. It was fantastic, but I'm probably not feeling something so close to reality for my next series.
* I read the first Dune, and it was quite good, but I found myself not caring about any of the characters, so didn't continue the series.
* I enjoyed the first two books of the Dragonriders of Pern, a lot! But really didn't like book 3 at all or where the world went, and it made me not want to continue the series.
* I absolutely loved the first 3/4s of Magician, by Feist, but I fell crashing hard out of love after Pugs return, and have no desire to continue the series.
* I devoured the Split Infinity trilogy by Piers Anthony.
* I couldn't get into the Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy. Maybe I don't like too much humor in my books? I dunno.
* I read The Road by Cormac McCarthy....don't even talk to me about that, I'm still dying inside. I got to the part with the baby and legit went to wake up my babies and held them while I cried myself to sleep. I  don't want **anything** like this book at all.
* **ETA** \- LotR and all other books in the series is off the table, purely because Im saving it to read to my kids in a few years, the way it was read to me! 

&#x200B;

I have a feeling that The Realm of Elderlings is up my alley? Can anyone who has read a bulk of what Ive read, confirm?

TL:DR: I'm looking for something with the same depth of character, world building, prose, story, politics, etc as The Wheel of Time and Stormlight Archive, but that's not too dark. And if you have them, I'm open to Scifi recommendations as well.

1711416051.0,Looking for a proper adventure fantasy novel with romance as subplot and not main,"Looking for a well created adventure fantasy with good world building, smart characters and romance being secondary and not primary. No red flag guys, no toxic relationship, no trauma excuses for shitty behaviour, no girl trying to “fix” the guy.

As a reference, my recent favourite has been six of crows. I loved how the central theme of the story revolves around the heist and everyone’s motivation with romance being only a part of it.

I especially loved loved loved the female character Inez Ghafa- poised, calm, quiet and reserved but the best thief of secrets, assassin and such a mentally and emotionally strong and pious Wraith. I would love to read more characters like her",Fantasy

1711405808.0,Graphic Novel & Manga Bingo Card with Reviews,"I have finished my third card! While completing my [Hard Mode Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/16w8mbf/2023_hard_mode_bingo_complete_card_tier_list_and/), and my [Must-Be-Normal Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1b4sm7b/mustbenormal_complete_bingo_card_with_tier_list/), I got the idea to try to complete a Graphic Novel & Manga Card. Now, I realize this is against the rules, but since I already completed two cards where I did follow all the rules, I thought it could be fun to do this challenge. For this challenge, all books had to be some sort of graphic novel, comic, or manga.

I also achieved Library Mode and Hero Mode, which means I got all of my books from the library, and I wrote reviews for all of them here on r/Fantasy. Since manga and graphic novels often are series, I decided to try to read the entire series and not just the first volume. That made this card considerably harder. Since I received all of my books from the library, this slowed my process down when it came to some series (i.e., the library had not purchased the latest volume yet). For the vast majority of the squares, I read all of the volumes which are out. If I did not, then I would specify it in my ""info"" section. Only one series have I decided to DNF. 

Overall, I did really enjoy this experience. Several of the books I read became new favorites, and I am considering trying this challenge again next year. We will see! Please feel free to ask any questions you have in the chat.

**Title with a Title: The Apothecary Diaries by Natsu Hyuuga and Nekokurage**

* Info: Ongoing with 11 volumes out. I have read the first 10.
* Keywords: Seinen Manga / Mystery / Alternate World which is vaguely based on Ancient China / Inner Court of the Palace / Palace Intrigue / Awesome Female MC
* Review: Highly recommend! I find the characters very dynamic, and the mysteries, palace intrigue, and setting very interesting. I think it is a series that would appeal to a wide array of people. It doesn’t have any noticeable fantastical elements - it is speculative due to its alternate world setting.

&#x200B;

**Superheroes: Magical Boy by The Kao**

* Info: Complete with 2 volumes.
* Keywords: Young Adult Graphic Novel / Transboy MC / Magical Boy not Magical Girl / Nod to Magical Girl Tropes like Sailor Moon / Superheroes
* Review: Highly recommend! This is a great coming of age story, following an MC who has grown up in a family where everyone is a magical girl. But how can he be a magical girl when he knows he is a boy? Lots of fun!

&#x200B;

**Bottom of the TBR: The Girl from the Other Side: Siuil, a Run by Nagabe**

* Info: Complete with 12 volumes. 
* Keywords: Shonen Manga / Visually distinct and beautiful / Mystery / Found Family / Weird Cursed Beings / Separation Between Inside and Outside
* Review: A favorite of mine. A cursed being called Teacher cares for an abandoned girl named Shiva. But how did Teacher get cursed? And is something special about Shiva? Extremely engaging mystery, with gothic fairytale vibes.

&#x200B;

**Magical Realism: The Many Deaths of Laila Starr by Ram V and Philipe Andrade**

* Info: Standalone omnibus of 5 issues.
* Keywords: Graphic Novels / Magical Realism in Comic Form / Mumbai, India / Hindu Mythology / Art has nice color palette / Death is fired and becomes mortal / Life and Death / Queer
* Review: Incredibly unique. Death is fired from her job because it is predicted that a human will one day discover immortality. As Death tries to thwart the individual who discovers immortality, she learns a lot about mortal life and death along the way. A story which will make you think.

&#x200B;

**Young Adult: Natsume’s Book of Friends by Yuki Midorikawa**

* Info: Ongoing with 29 volumes. I read the first 15.
* Keywords: Shoujo Manga / Cozy Slice of Life Fantasy / Tons of Heart / All the whimsy / Rural Life / A boy is able to see yokai / Learning how to make friends / Helping people
* Review: An absolutely favorite of mine. We follow a boy named Natsume and his “bodyguard cat” Madara as Natsume learns to trust others and helps the humans and yokai around him. Everyone should read this.

&#x200B;

**Mundane Jobs: The Savior’s Book Café Story in Another World by Kyouka Izumi, Ouimiya, and Reiko Sakurada**

* Info: Complete with 5 volumes.
* Keywords: Josei Manga / Isekai or Portal Fantasy / MC is the magical savior but spends her time running a book café / MC is a woman in her 30s / MxF Romance / Cozy Fantasy
* Review: This was super cute! Near the end of volume 2 I didn’t like the pacing, but that fixed itself as the story continued. We follow our MC Tsukina as she falls in love, runs a book café, and occasionally (secretly) saves her country. Recommend if you want a cozy story, an “older” MC, and a sweet, subtle love story. 

&#x200B;

**Published in the 2000s: Fullmetal Alchemist by Hiromu Arakawa**

* Info: Complete with 27 volumes.
* Keywords: Shonen Manga / Absolutely Classic / Alternate world with alchemy / MC is trying to rescue his brother’s body / MC lost his arm and leg / Unique and well-written cast of characters / So much horrible things under the surface / War and genocide / Despite the tags is not graphic with gore
* Review: In my opinion, the best “classic shonen” ever written. We follow a genius boy alchemist (Edward) and his brother (Alphonse) whose soul is trapped in a suit of armor as they try to find a way to recover Alphonse’s body. But as they continue on this journey, horrible things come to light. They end up having to team up with a wide array of unique characters to save their country. 

&#x200B;

**Murder Mysteries by Neil Gaiman and P. Craig Russell**

* Info: Standalone.
* Keywords: Graphic Novel / Angels / First murder happens / Archangel is assigned to investigate / Contemplative / Creation and God’s Purpose
* Review: Very unique graphic novel. Based on a short story by Neil Gaiman, this story follows the first murder investigation, as an angel is found dead. Recommend to anyone who wants something different, or read Good Omens and wants something more (but a bit more contemplation and much less whimsy). 

&#x200B;

**Short Stories: Through the Woods by Emily Carroll**

* Info: Standalone.
* Keywords: Young Adult Graphic Novel / Gothic Fairy Tales / Short stories / Horror friendly to those who don’t like gore / Stunning art style
* Review: I absolutely love this and highly recommend it. A collection of gothic and creepy short stories with a fairy tale edge, it is a perfect read for an October night. 

&#x200B;

**Horror: Petshop of Horrors by Akino Matsuri**

* Info: Complete with 10 volumes.
* Keywords: Josei Manga / Gothic with horror undertones / Found Family / ‘90s LA Chinatown / Pet Shop with mythical creatures as pets / If you don’t follow your contract, you may die…
* Review: I really enjoyed this manga series. We follow our MC Count D, who works at a mysterious pet shop. Some of his clients who come to his pet shop, however, have some moral failing. If they follow their contract, then nothing bad will happen, but people seem to struggle with following their contract… This story oscillates between its more horror-side and found family-side. Which sounds like a weird combination, but somehow it works. Recommend to those interested in stories with mythical beings and some light horror.

&#x200B;

**Self or Indie Published: Heavenly Delusion by Masakazu Ishiguro**

* Info: Ongoing with 6 volumes out. I’ve read the first two.
* Keywords: Seinen Manga / Science Fiction / Post Apocalyptic / Two storylines / Storyline 1 is two teenagers traveling around post-apocalyptic Japan fighting “man-eaters” / storyline 2 follows an isolated school of genetically engineered teenagers who are isolated from the rest of the world.
* Review: To be honest, I decided this manga was not for me and have decided to not continue with it. It does have some interesting sci-fi elements, but the plot was all over the place and I felt one of the characters was objectified in a weird way. However, many people do like it, so give it a try if you are interested in some weird sci-fi.

&#x200B;

**Middle East: Squire by Sara Alfageeh and Madia Shammas**

* Info: Standalone. 
* Keyword: Young Adult Graphic Novel / Alternate world with a vaguely historical Arab setting / Coming of age story / Teenage girl dreams of becoming a Squire and Knight / But what does it mean to be in the military / Discrimination
* Review: I found the art, ideas, and characters to be beautiful in this story, although I think the plot was rushed at the end and felt a little messy and predictable. We follow a girl named Aiza who dreams of becoming a Squire and fighting in the military. To do so, however, she needs to hide her ethnic background, and along the way she realizes the real military experience is not like being a Knight in a story. I still recommend it even with the pacing issues.

&#x200B;

**Published in 2023: Stories of the Islands by Clar Angkasa**

* Info: Standalone
* Keyword: Middle Grade Graphic Novel / Short Story Collection / Indonesian Folklore / Feminist Retellings / Retelling of “Keong Max,” “Bawang Merah Bawang Putih,” and “Timun Mas” / Really beautiful art / Each story has its own color palette
* Review: I really enjoyed reading this beautiful collection of short stories. Based off of Indonesian folklore, these feminist retellings are depicted with truly gorgeous art.

&#x200B;

**Kakuriyo: Bed & Breakfast for Spirits by Waco Ioka**

* Info: Ongoing with 8 volumes
* Keyword: Shoujo Manga / Spirit World / Food / Cozy Fantasy / Maybe a romance will happen
* Review: This cozy, laid-back fantasy manga series follows a girl named Aoi, who needs to pay off her grandfather’s debt to the owner of a spirit inn. But instead of marrying the owner, she decides to start a restaurant. Cute, with a real emphasis on food. But the plot really just meanders along. So although I enjoyed it, I would only casually recommend it. 

&#x200B;

**POC Author: My Happy Marriage by Akumi Agitogi and Rito Kohsaka**

* Info: Ongoing with 5 volumes, I’ve read the first 4.
* Keywords: Shoujo Manga / Historical-ish Japan with magic / Cinderella-esque / MxF romance / Plot is ramping up
* Review: In this series we follow Miyo, who is married off to Kiyoka, who is described as being a very scary man. Mistreated by her family due to her lack of magical gift, Miyo finds Kiyoka to be a much kinder man than he seems. But as Miyo becomes used to her fiancé, mysterious and dangerous events seem to be going on in the background. I have really enjoyed this series so far, and I highly recommend it. 

&#x200B;

**Book Club or Readalong: Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow by Tom King, Bilquis Evely, and Mat Lopes**

* Info: Standalone Omnibus, consisting of 8 issues
* Keywords: Superhero story / Science Fiction / Space Travel / On a quest to save a dog / Revenge / Feminist / Hugo nominated
* Review: I am very new to reading superhero comics, but I really enjoyed this one. We follow Supergirl as she travels across the universe with a girl on a quest for revenge. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy science fiction and space operas. The art was stunning as well.  

&#x200B;

**Novella: Fangs by Sarah Andersen**

* Info: Standalone
* Keywords: Graphic Novel / Cute / Cozy / Vampire and Werewolf are in love / Slice of life / Relationship humor
* Review: This was a super cute short graphic novel, which follows the daily life of a vampire and werewolf couple. Read if you want something that is cute in a different way.

&#x200B;

**Mythical Beast: The Fox & Little Tanuki by Mi Tagawa**

* Info: Ongoing with 6 volumes
* Keywords: Shoujo Manga / Fantasy / All main characters are spirit creatures / Found Family / Japanese mythology / Foxes, Wolves, and Tanuki
* Review: We follow a black fox named Senzou, who is allowed to leave his imprisonment if he becomes a mentor to a tanuki cub named Manpachi. However, was Senzou truly guilty of the crime which originally imprisoned him? What secrets are beneath the surface? I absolutely love this series, and I cannot help but wonder why no one is talking about it. 

&#x200B;

**Elemental Magic: Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal Edition by Naoko Takeuchi**

* Info: Complete at 10 omnibuses. I have read the first 7.
* Keywords: Shoujo Manga / Classic / Magical Girl / Science Fantasy / ‘90s Japan / MxF romance / Queer Elements
* Review: “Fighting evil by moonlight. Winning love by daylight. Never running from a real fight. She is the one named Sailor Moon.” I am a bit too young to have watched the TV show, and I didn’t have cable anyway. But a few times I stayed over at my grandma’s house, I was able to watch this show, and I have been curious about it ever since. Reading it… my feelings on it are complex. Sometimes I really enjoy it. Other times, I really don’t. I plan on finishing it, and I am really glad I have read it, but I definitely don’t agree on some of the decisions the author made. \[With that said, I am really happy about the queer elements of the manga\]. 

&#x200B;

**Retelling: Hollow by Shannon Watters, Branden Boyer-White, and Berenice Nelle**

* Info: Standalone
* Keywords: Young Adult Graphic Novel / Queer Retelling of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow / Urban Fantasy / Paranormal / Fun
* Review: I found this to be a fun story to read around Halloween time. Not much to say besides the fact that it is a fun and queer retelling of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow.

&#x200B;

**Queernorm: Tea Dragon Series by Kay O’Neill**

* Info: Complete with three volumes
* Keywords: Middle Grade Graphic Novel / Tea Dragons / AMAZING art / Queer / Coming of age / Found family / Cozy
* Review: One of my favorite reads. We follow Greta, who is learning about the dying art of tea dragon care-taking from tea shop owners Hesekiel and Erik, and their ward Minette. The art in this story is amazing - you could rip off any random page in the book and frame it. I highly recommend it for anyone in a cozy mood. 

&#x200B;

**Coastal/Island: The Girl from the Sea by Molly Knox Ostertag**

* Info: Standalone
* Keywords: Young Adult Graphic Novel / LGBTQIA+ / Lesbian Romance / Selkie / Environmental Activism / Coming of age
* Review: This super cute graphic novel follows Morgan, who is a human girl coming to terms with her sexuality, and Keltie, a selkie girl who wants to save her home. Recommend for queer coming of age shenanigans. 

&#x200B;

**Druids: The Sprite and the Gardener by Rii Abrego and Joe Whitt**

* Info: Standalone
* Keywords: Middle Grade Graphic Novel / Short / Whimsical / Nature sprites / Cozy Fantasy / Gardening
* Review: In this story we follow a sprite named Wisteria, who wishes to learn how to garden, and in the process helps become friends with a human. I recommend if you want something very short and sweet.

&#x200B;

**Robots: Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou Deluxe Edition by Hitoshi Ashinano**

* Info: Ongoing with 4 omnibuses. I’ve read the first 2.
* Keywords: Seinen Manga / Cozy Science Fiction / Classic / MC is a robot / Quiet life after an apocalypse / Friendship
* Review: This quiet slice of life story follows Alpha, a robot, who runs a small, rural cafe. Although we have hints that this is post apocalypse, the story is really focused on slow living. I recommend it if you are in the mood for something cozy.

&#x200B;

**Sequel: Witch Hat Atelier Kitchen by Hiromi Sato and Kamome Shirahama**

* Info: Ongoing with 2 volumes.
* Keywords: Seinen Manga / Companion series to Witch Hat Atelier / Cozy Fantasy / Focus on cooking / Actual recipes are included
* Review: Are you a fan of Witch Hat Atelier? \[You should be, it’s amazing\]. Do you desire more content? Do you miss the cozy found family days? Then this series is for you! We follow Qifrey and Olruggio as they cook various dishes. Recipes are included, as well as plenty of cozy moments between the Atelier gang. I recommend it if you are a fan of the original series and/or you enjoy cooking.

Short stories:  
The Library of Babel by Jorge Luis Borges  
2018-04-01 by Cixin Liu  
Contraction by Cixin Liu  
The Time Migration by Cixin Liu  
Restoration of Faith by Jim Butcher

**Favourite book(s)**  
The First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie. The humour, the wit, the dialogue, the characters, everything was fantastic. Book two was the weakest but still good. I just wish the kissing was even slightly less disgusting.

**Worst book**  
The Twelve. This was so bad I was unable to finish it, but due to the nature of the prompt (TBR) I kept it here. Complete and utter rubbish, and I quite liked the first book. The paperback has been on my shelf since I listened to book one on CD, so it's been a while. Now I can finally get rid of it.

**Most pleasant surprise**  
The Spirit Bares Its Teeth. I didn't enjoy the author's first book (Hell Followed With Us) that much, because while I liked the ideas and the setting, it seemed immature and unpolished to me. This second book however I liked so much that I read it in a single day, and it had none of the same shortcomings in my opinion, it didn’t even read like it was aimed at a younger audience.

**Disappointing**  
I was very much looking forward to The Book That Wouldn't Burn, and the first half grabbed me with its beautiful prose and fantastic worldbuilding, but I just didn't seem to care about the actual plot towards the end. Unsure if I will read the next book in the series.

**Not what I expected**  
I thought City of Brass was adult fantasy but it turned out to be a very tropey YA romance story I didn’t really enjoy.

**Most frustrating**  
Witch King. I really wanted to like this one, I thought the writing and world were great but it was just too confusing. It's bad when the dramatis personae makes understanding things harder.

**Hidden Gem**  
Dear Spellbook. A DnD inspired progression fantasy with a time loop element. After spending most of last year in Baldur's Gate 3 I was more than happy to find a very similar magic system in this trilogy, along with great characters, good humour and a fun story. ",Fantasy

1. The First Law Trilogy is a series that has to be read as all three books because you don't realize what Joe was doing in #1 until you finish book #3.
2. George is probably never finishing those books but no point in pointing that out.
3. Have you tried Malazan?
4. Sanderson is overrated but will be recommended in every thread.
5. Seriously, have you tried Malazan?
6. If request want a book without X element, you will receive 1/3rd recommendations with X element.
7. A lot of posters have no idea about what David Eddings or Marion Zimmer Bradley did. Sometimes I wish none of us did.
8. Indie books will receive less respect than traditional books even when they're read by everyone
9. Whatever is requested, Malazan definitely fits.
10. Grimdark is the single most awful horrible thing that has ever been put to print OR it is just fantasy that has people swearing. No one can agree which is the proper definition.
11. Every thread on the Dresden Files will ask, ""Does the male gaze ever get any better?"" The answer is, ""Yes but no.""
12. The thing that annoys most fans about Kvothe is his sex god powers. 
13. Rothuss is also not finishing those books but really should have done those chapters for charity.
14. Scott Lynch WILL be finishing those books. But guy has health issues so leave him alone.
15. Mark Lawrence is the saint of Indie writers everywhere even when he's not an indie writer.
16. Bingo is an eldritch magical incantation that conjures all manner of fascinating books.
17. I understand what Hopepunk is in theory but am not sure what is an example. Maybe Malazan. JK. Probably.
18. 1/2 of all readers will nope out of Thomas Covenant after that scene.
19. A good half of the readers here love YA and half of those will admit to it.
20. It is always okay to DNF a book but lots of us still feel guilty about it.
21. Goodreads ratings are useless.
22. The best deals can probably be found here.
23. Kindle Unlimited is 90% terrible but 10% is fantastic. Seriously try Kings of Paradise, Cradle, and Dungeon Crawler Carl.
24. Dungeons and Dragons fiction is something everyone remembers liking but almost never discusses. Especially Dragonlance.
25. The Wheel of Time is something that almost everyone remembers starting but only about one in a hundred ever finish.
26. All LGBT book requests will be about lesbian necromancers in space, despite not being lesbians together, or a traitor that isn't a great ending if you like romance.
27. The new popular thing is not cool because it's new and popular.
28. Authors do post here but they're just like everybody else.
29. Awesome series can be cut short by publishers without any warning or explanation.
30. The same ten recommendations will dominate all thread requests but they are really good books. Especially Malazan.
31. Is Fitz ever going to get a break? No, he will not. 
32. Where to start with Discworld will receive ninety three answers. Also, Guards Guards.
33. Sanderson will challenge the gods of Amazon and something-something will benefit other authors.
34. The more you mention not wanting X, the more X will be recommended.
35. No post after 300 words will be read, only skimmed. Half will make it past 150.
36. LGBT recommendations have a 50% chance of not including any LGBT characters, and 100% chance of Sanderson.
37. Science fiction is **also** fantasy but some people take that definition personally. Unless it's Murderbot.
38. The Sword of Truth inflicts SAN damage and yet more people read it the more people describe how awful it is. Probably for the BDSM sex ninjas.
39. Almost everyone has read at least some of the Drizzt Do'urden books but almost no one actually has anything to say on them.
40. Michael R. Fletcher is fantastic but writes some WEIRD premises like stone guy out to recover his missing soul fragments or where magic requires you to be insane.
41. ""Am the only one who thinks X?"" will probably list an incredibly common viewpoint.
42. Listing all the books you've read usually don't actually say anything for what you might like, sadly. Because they will recommend Sanderson and Malazan even if you've read both.
43. ""Romantasy"" will be added as a description if it is by a female author and anyone kisses.
44. Romance requests almost certainly will get recommendations where one of the couple kills the other.
45. Audiobooks are incredibly common but treated as a new invention still.
46. People will assume you're making up the elements of John Ringo's books like the plague that makes all women look like Scarlet Johansen and nymphomaniacs.
47. People will continuously have difficulty describing what Lit-RPG is to someone who isn't a gamer or the appeal to so many fans.
48. The Vorkosigan Saga is awesome and severely underrated.
49. All opinions are welcome except THAT one. Then you must be downvoted to nonexistence.
50. Amazon adaptations are of the Devil but we're all still watching them.",Fantasy
1711402406.0,The Bone Ships/Tide Child trilogy questions ,"Finished the first of the Tide Child trilogy by RJ Barker yesterday and enjoyed it! No spoilers, but I do have a few questions:

1) how do you pronounce Joron? “Joe-ron”, “jore-on”, “jaw-on”, something else? I kept accidentally misreading it as Jordan ngl!

2) on a similar note, how do you pronounce Meas? I was reading it as “meez” or “mayz”

3) how old do you think Meas is supposed to be? I kept imagining her as being mid twenties because I’m used to main characters being 18-25 ish and if the age isn’t explicitly stated then I will automatically imagine the character to be around my own age. Pretty sure she’s supposed to be middle age - didn’t want to google anything in case I saw spoilers!

4) not a question, just wanted to say I fully imagine Gullaime as a bloke in a bird costume. He’s just a fella ready for Halloween👍

Just got back into reading fantasy after a two year long slump and discovered this subreddit. Thanks all! :)",Fantasy
1711401816.0,Another bingo newbie!,"Hello everyone! Just finished up my first year of bingo. I had a great time and read a lot of good stuff. Here's what I read. All but 3 squares are hard mode (my goal for next year will be to complete the whole card in hard mode).

**Title with a title, not royalty:** ***The Wizard’s Butler*** **by Nathan Lowell.** Read during a migraine. It was perfect because the plot wasn’t too complicated and I could follow along even with the brain fog. Basically, a veteran in need of a job gets hired as a butler for an elderly man who thinks himself a wizard. Some people complain the book has too many mundane details about MC’s learning the ropes as a butler, but I found those scenes enjoyable. 3 stars.

**Superheroes, not DC or Marvel:** ***Starter Villain*** **by John Scalzi.** Yes, it is about a supervillain instead of a superhero. And it’s not an individual with superpowers; Charlie inherits his uncle’s supervillain business, volcano lair and everything. I still think it fits the prompt. It’s a fun read and it has cats in it. 4 stars.

**Bottom of the TBR:** ***Immobility*** **by Brian Evenson** (audiobook), which has been on my TBR since its release in 2012. It was on Audible plus so I gave it a listen. I loved the performance and the story, and I would have given it 5 stars if not for the ending. Fuck that ending. 4.5 stars.

**Magical realism, hard mode:** ***All’s Wel*****l by Mona Awad**. I could not ask for a better read during a chronic pain flare-up! It was weird and darkly hilarious. I think I liked it even more than *Bunny*. 4.5 stars.

**Young Adult:** ***Howl’s Moving Castle*** **by Diana Wynne Jones** (audiobook). I’m only sorry it took me so long to finally read this book! It was as good as everyone said. Love the characters, love the story. I may continue with this series.

**Mundane jobs, not set on Earth:** ***Legends & Lattes*** **by Travis Baldree.** Picked this up for my kid while we were at the beach. She never read it, so I did. Look, I’m not ashamed to admit it - I loved this book and devoured it in one sitting. Also, Thimble is the best. So yeah, 5 stars.

**Published in the 2000s:** ***Succubus Blues*** **by Richelle Mead.** This 2007 urban fantasy is the first of the Georgia Kincaid series. Georgia is a succubus living in Seattle and working a day-job at a bookstore, and she’s about to meet Seth Mortensen, aka the writer of her favorite book series. But of course, things don’t quite go as planned. 3.5 stars.

**Angels and demons, protagonist is angel/demon:** ***A Witch’s Guide to Fake Dating a Demon*** **by Sarah Hawley**. A paranormal rom-com about a witch pretending to date a demon she accidentally summons and can’t get rid of, read for r/romancebooks’ Autumn Reading Challenge. Found it kind of a comfort read; it’s pretty low angst, with an HEA ending. 3.75 stars.

**An entire short story collection:** ***North American Lake Monsters*** **by Nathan Ballangrud.** I’m not sure how to describe my response to this book. Every time I finished one story, my brain said, “Another!” They are all good, but the strongest in my opinion is “The Good Husband.” I will definitely be reading more from Nathan Ballangrud. 4.5 stars.

**Horror, not Lovecraft or King:** ***Camp Damascus*** **by Chuck Tingle**. I un-ironically love Chuck Tingle (I’ve read and liked many of his “no-sex Tinglers”) and I’m a big horror fan, so it was pretty much a given that I’d read this. It is a solid entry into the horror genre, with a unique story and a likable protagonist (also, I really liked Mara Wilson as the narrator). And now it’s also a Stoker Award nominee. Love is real, buckaroos! 4 stars.

**Self-published or indie publisher, has fewer than 100 ratings on Goodreads:** ***The Demon Inside Me*** **by Chace Verity** \- I don’t know what I was expecting when I checked this book out on KU, but it wasn’t this - and I am *not* complaining! This book was funny and sweet (and yes, also kinda smutty, but in a way that fits the characters and the story). 4 stars.

**Set in the Middle East, author is of Middle Eastern heritage:** ***Girl, Serpent Thorn*** **by Melissa Bashardoust** (audiobook version).This is a book I might never have read if not for bingo. Although it is marketed as a YA novel, I think it works for adults, too. I was pleasantly surprised. Good narration, and an immersive story. 4 stars.

**Published in 2023, author’s debut novel:** ***The Centre*** **by Ayesha Manazir Siddiqi** (audiobook). In this debut novel, a translator attends an elite language school that promises complete fluency in just 10 days, but all is not as it seems. I thought the narration was good and the story well-written, if a little slow-paced. And I started to lose interest a little. Then the author dropped a bomb I didn’t see coming and I realized just how she had played me the whole book. Well done. 4 stars.

**Multiverse, no literal doors:** ***This Is How You Lose the Time War*** **by Amal El-Motar and Max Gladstone**. A time-traveling epistolary romance? Sign me up! Beautiful prose, too . Sometimes I had no idea what the heck was going on, and it was still lovely. I will probably read it again at some point. 4 stars.

**POC author, futuristic/sci-fi setting:** ***Dawn*** **by Octavia Butler** \- My one reread square. This is the first book in Octavia Butler’s Xenogenesis Trilogy. Basically, humans have fucked Earth up royally, so aliens intervene. I’d planned to read the second book, *Adulthood Rites*, for this square, but once I started it, I realized it’d been too long since I read *Dawn* and I’d forgotten too much. But Octavia Butler’s worth a reread. 4 stars.

**Book Club or Read Along Book:** ***Vita Nostra*** **by Marina & Sergey Dyachenko with Julia Meitov Hersey (Translator).** Someone on Goodreads described *Vita Nostra* as, “like Harry Potter, but if it was written by Kafka” and I was like, “I’m in.” I convinced my sister to do a buddy read of it with me. I found myself confused by it in the best way possible and I was utterly hooked; she DNFed. She swears she will finish it one day, out of spite. 4 stars.

**Novella not published by Tor:** ***Heart, Haunt, Havoc*** **by Freydis Moon.** A queer haunted house novella, and the first in the Gideon Testaments series. It was a fun read and I do plan to check out the next book in the series. 4 stars.

**Featuring mythical beasts, but not dragons:** ***Clean Sweep*** **by Ilona Andrews.** I’d tried Ilona Andrews’ Kate Daniels series and couldn't get into it. But I saw the Innkeeper series posted in the bingo recommendations thread when I was looking for a book that would fit this square for hard mode. I gave it a shot and now I am hooked on this series. That’s a win for me! 4 stars.

**Elemental magic, hard mode:** ***Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik*** \- I read this book specifically for this prompt, I chose it from the recommendations thread. I don’t think I’d have read it otherwise, but I'm so glad I did! I really enjoyed this one. I would have preferred it without so many third-person POVs, though. 4.5 stars.

**Myths and retellings, not Greek or Roman:**  >!Comfort Me with Apples by Catherynne M. Valente. !< I was told to go into the audiobook blind, without even reading the summary, so I did. I was underwhelmed; >!turns out it’s just a Garden of Eden retelling!<.  I mean, I liked it well enough, I just didn’t really get the hype. 3 stars.

**Queernorm, not a futuristic setting:** ***Prince and Bodyguard*** **by Tavia Lark.** A prince and his bodyguard fall in love while trying not to die. I read this one for a Bodyguard prompt in a different reading challenge, even though I had never read any of the other books in the  series and it’s not really meant to be a standalone. I was able to get the gist of the backstory for the most part. Good balance between romance and plot. 3.5 stars.

**Coastal setting, featuring seafaring:** ***Whalefall*** **by Daniel Krause.** Ok, this one probably skates by on a technicality for hard mode, since the seafaring happens, you know, *inside of a whale*. There are some flashback scenes where the MC is on a boat with his dad, so I still think it counts! Anyway, this book sucked me in and kept me there, just like that whale did to Jay. 5 stars.

**~~Druid~~** **Features vampires; a main character is a vampire:** ***A Dowry of Blood*** **by S. T. Gibson** (audiobook). This was my one square substitution. I like vampires, what can I say? This book is told from the point of view of one of Dracula’s wives. It’s not exactly a retelling, since the events of Bram Stoker’s *Dracula* don’t appear in this story at all. The narration was great, there’s good character development, and I thought it had a fitting ending. 4 stars.

**Features robots, a main character is a robot:** ***World Running Down*** **by Al Hess -** Queer, dystopian sci-fi with a bit of romance and found-family vibes. It meets hard mode because one of the MCs is an AI who has unwillingly been placed in an android body. It was a fun read and if there were a sequel I would read it. 4 stars.

**Sequel:** ***The Hour Mage*** **by Angelina J. Steffort.** Book #2 of the Quarter Mage series. The series is billed as “upper YA” and I guess it would be considered romantasy. I really liked the first one so I thought I’d read the next one. We get more character backstory and lore, and we see more of the Fae kingdom. 3 stars.",Fantasy
1711401596.0,Bingo Roundup 2023,"To start with, I give out a fair number of 5-star ratings on this card.  Those are books that I think are good, and/or enjoyed.  In terms of books that I read which are (1) good, (2) also *interesting*, in that I think that they have something to say and I was interested in conceptual arguments that they made, and (3) not already super-well known (so Piranisi doesn’t rank).  

tl;dr:  You should consider checking out: 

* **A Choir of Lies** - Alex Rowland 

* **The Mimicking of Known Successes** - Malka Older

* **Some Desperate Glory** - Emily Tesh

Title with a Title:  **The Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue** - McKenzie Lee - 2 / 5 

It was… fine.  It was silly, it was there.  It felt kind of fetishizing, and if I hadn’t looked it up specifically to write this, I’d have guessed that it was written around 2005.  Gay romance, plucky sister, nothing really grabbed me about it at all. 

Superheroes: **Dreadnought** - April Daniels - 2/10 

Look, I am not a superheroes person.  I read this classically superhero book in fulfillment of the spirit of the card.  I’m marginally more into queer books, so that part was okay.  It felt like a direct offshoot of the Whately universe stuff that was floating around on the internet for a while?  It was fast, and I didn’t totally hate it. 

Bottom of the TBR:  **Scythe** - Neil Schusterman - 5/5

Look, this book has been jostling around the bottom of my TBR since I was in the age group that it was aimed at.  Finally got to it this year while dogsitting for someone who had it on the shelf, and it was awesome.   Really creative, lots of interesting perspectives on death, lots of people in a post-mortality world espousing their opinions on mortality.  Their version of the internet was also super interesting.  Strongly recommend.  

Literary Fantasy:  **Piranesi** - Susannah Clark - 5/5 

Gorgeous.  The kind of atmospheric read that I wish that I could read over again, and some of the clearest visual imagery that I’ve ever gotten from a book.  The narrator was also a delight in all of his oddities, although I was a bit disappointed that no one ever turned into a bird. 

Young Adult - **The Stolen Heir** - Holly Black - 3 / 5 

I grew up on Holly Black, and it hits a specific kind of twistedness that I just really enjoy, in a form that’s palatable enough for young adults.  With that said, this wasn’t my favorite of her work.  It dragged a bit in the middle.   I appreciated that the narrator always felt like she was about 30 seconds away from biting someone. 

Mundane Jobs - **Cupcakes, Trinkets, and other Deadly Magic** - Meghan Ciana Dodge - 1.5/5

The main character was dumber than a bag of rocks, and horribly passive.  I’ve got a pretty high tolerance for romance/urban fantasy/whatever as long as it clips along at a decent pace.  I feel like being very readable and fast is one of the really significant upsides to that subgenre.  At least there were a lot of cupcakes that usually sounded good?  

Published in the 00s - **The Truth-Teller's Tale** - Sharon Shinn - 3.5/5

Felt even older than it was.  Honestly just a fairly quiet, slow, sweet  little story about a pair of sisters growing up who are very different but love each other very much.  

Angels and Demons - **Hell Bent** - Leigh Bardugo - 4/5

When I read *Ninth House*, I was not blown away.  This was frustrating, because Ninth House is the sort of book that on paper, I really should like.  “If I do not like this book,” I said to myself, “then I’m very confused about the reason for this book’s existence because on paper it should be right up my alley and if even I do not love this book, then who will?” 

Hell Bent was better, and I’m actually reasonably excited for the next one.  Everyone got more agency in this one, there wasn’t the set of flashbacks, and I liked that her roomates got fleshed out.  Cool visuals, less of Alex getting batted around by forces outside of her control. 

Horror - **The Twisted Ones** - T. Kingfisher - 5/5

Brilliant.  I feel like T. Kingfisher writes resoundingly mediocre romance, but really kick-ass horror.  The Hollow places was amazing, and the Twisted Ones was also fantastic - her fantasy race was great, and the snippets through of historical documentation, and the way that she intertwined the domestic with houses with horror was great.  

Self-Published - **Hands of the Emperor** - Victoria Goddard 5/5 

Excellent. It does a really nice job talking about family, and miscommunication, and the ways that miscommunication can and can’t be laid on the main character, and the ways that we struggle to talk about what is most important to us with those who should in theory be closest to us.  It also has the least othering portrayal of non-anglo culture that I’ve ever read, where the main character will put on a grass skirt and do ceremonial dances over a bed of coals and it’s treated like him changing his clothes and doing this utterly-normal-if-important thing.  Has strong ideas about universal basic income and also the postal system.  Surprisingly funny, and also very warm. 

 Often compared to the goblin Emperor, except that the Goblin Emperor annoyed the crap out of me (passive protagonist who is nice but never actually uses his immense power to fix any of the extremely serious underlying societal issues presented in the book), and this book fixed those problems.   Also the sequel read like straight-up fanfiction, but I was sold enough on the first one that I read it and enjoyed it anyway.  And will read the next one after. 

Middle Eastern Setting - **Neom** - Lavie Tidhar - 3.5/5 

A very surreal and dreamy little story about a robot and a flower-seller and the child of a terrorartist.  There was a bunch of little creative touches, and small delightful moments.  Interestingly, Neom is an actual proposed city, which is currently being built as per the orders of a prince in Saudi Arabia.  There were a lot of really *interesting* things in this book that were just hinted at and not really explored, and I feel like most of it went over my head.  I feel like it would appeal to fans of Strange the Dreamer. 

Published in 2023 - **Iron Flame** - Rebecca Yarros - 3.5/5 

Not as good as Fourth Wing, but I still flew through it.  Appreciated that it foregrounded her mother & sibling relationships more.  Still a masterclass in pacing.  More dragons, evil encroaching monster army, teenage rebellion, bad-boy romance, a pleasing amount of libraries, generally a good time. 

POC Author - **The Wicked and the Willing** - Lianyu Tan - 4/5

I don’t normally read erotica, and this is a choose-your-own-ending dark romance lesbian colonialism vampire book.  Vampire was horrible and got a fair amount of POV time and her own political struggles, main character was fundamentally passive but horrible in a fairly interesting way, and the wholesome driver who tried to rescue her was very stoically butch and generally just a fairly charming mess.  I don’t really know how to review this genre, but all sex aside I thought it was pretty good.  It also avoided that super annoying thing that a lot of fantasy books do where they’ll introduce a fantasy element (vampirism) as an metaphor for something else (colonialism) as a way to avoid interacting with that actual thing at all, and then the entire thing ends up as just an uncomfortable mess.  This one did a nice job of examining it, & was under no illusions that any of the main characters were less than monsters.    

Multiverse and Alternate Realities - **Some Desperate Glory** - Emily Tesh - 4.5/5

Took off the 0.5 because the ending was pretty messy, but otherwise this was a fascinating deconstruction of Ender’s Game.  Kyr was delightfully horrible for most of it, and watching her snipe with an alternate-universe version of herself inside of her own head with both of them just being these incredibly blind, overachieving, stick-up-the-ass characters was great.  Also laugh-out-loud funny a lot of the time, while being about the end of the human race and child soldiers?   It was ambitious, it had a lot of interesting things to say, it was good, and I loved it. 

Bookclub Book - **The Mimicking of Known Successes** - Malka Older - 5/5 

Novella about people fighting about how to reintroduce species to the earth, as they live in exile on Jupiter after the earth was rendered uninhabitable.  Also a murder mystery romance with lesbian Sherlock Holmes and an Earth History Professor.   And I’m a sucker for lesbians, *and* academia, *and*  Sherlock Holmes.  

I liked this book because it was thematically tight - You can’t go back in relationships, you can’t go back when rebuilding your planet, you’re never going to be get it perfect and cannot depend on the mimicking of known successes.  You have to move forward.  

Gained extra depth as a book that was very clearly in response to covid, and asking what it means to build vs. rebuild, and what we give up when we refrain from making those choices. 

Novella - **The Marrow Thieves** - Cherie Dimaline - 2.5 / 5 

Look, no shade on this book, but climate change stresses me out and politics scares me and I don’t want to think about it and I don’t want to read dystopias about teenagers realistically getting hunted in the woods and sent to camps.  I finished it and it made me scared and sad because it wasn’t scared and sad in a way that I can do anything about.  A good book for someone, but not for me. 

Mythical Beasts - **The Magician's Daughter** - H. G. Perry - 5/5 

This was delightful.  Whimsical and magical, it felt like Eva Ibbitson was writing in 2023 for a slightly older audience.  All about finding family and saving magic and rabbits and crows and unexpected allies.  Just a really fun time. 

Elemental Magic - **The Foxglove King** - Hannah Whitten - 4 / 5

I couldn’t finish *For the Wolf*, and didn’t realize the author when I picked this one up, so it was a pleasant surprise.  I like necromancers, I like dark romances, I like catacombs, I like fake french history, and I read it in Paris so it was generally very thematic.  

Myths and Retellings - **A curse so dark and lonely** - Brigid Kemmerer 1/ 5

Look, this was not a good book.  The romance was awful, it dragged on for ages, I’m pretty sure they’re going to bait-and-switch the protagonist's main interest because for some godforsaken reason people took the wrong idea from A Court of Thorns and Roses and think that’s a good idea, half the characters were awful but in the most boring way that you can think of, and the plot points came out of basically nowhere which makes sense because the world felt like the thinnest cardboard you can imagine.  I am not a person who reads for plot, and I can’t remember the last time I gave a crap about worldbuilding, which should tell you just how bad this truly was. 

I finished it for the bingo.  

Queernorm Setting - **Legends and Lattes** - Travis Baldtree - 3 / 5 

It was fine.  It was sweet, and warm, and generally nice enough to read that it didn’t bore the crap out of me.  It felt very DnD heavy, and as someone who just doesn’t like coffee that much, that part fell pretty flat.  But it delivered on what was promised. 

Coastal or Island Setting - **A Choir of Lies** - Alex Rowland - 5*/5

The protagonist is responsible for a fantasy tulip inflation bubble in fantasy Amsterdam.  He’s also a silly, hopeless romantic who is very much feeling the results of the extreme callousness of the protagonist of the *last* book, who is unambiguously revealed as a Very Bad Person.  It’s really unique and interesting, and I highly recommend it.  

Druid - **The Bloody Queen** - Sarah Beth Durst -  4 / 5 

Sarah Beth Durst never seems like she can decide how angsty she wants her books to be.  I'd previously read *The Bone Maker* which is a heartwarming little 'getting the band back together' adventure... against an evil necromancer while the main character's husband is slowly dying & can only be powered by human corpses.  This is a book about The Power of Friendship, which ends in >!a brutal massacre where all of her friends are horribly killed!<.   It’s still about the power of friendship, I quite liked it, it’s just a little confused.  

I thought that it did elemental magic spirits really well, and I liked the school sequence, as well as the older protagonist in the two sequels. 

Features Robots - **Systems Collapse** - Martha Wells 

Look, it’s Murderbot, other people write better reviews about Murderbot than me.   I had fun. 

Sequel - **The Russian Cage** - Charlaine Harris - 4 / 5

Mexican gunslinger ends up traveling with a witch from the Holy Russian Empire of California which was formed after the Tsar was deposed and fled to the United States, to be hosted in Hurst Castle.   Super fun alternate history, generally a really good time.",Fantasy

Personally, my main stipulation is that their existence should not be something that dictates some deterministic or predestined end result that undercuts free will. Sorta like, if you know a prophecy exists, you in theory should be able to actually avert it if so chosen, but perhaps the original seer did not know the full context of who, what, where, when, how, and why as to what they originally saw.",Fantasy
1711394643.0,Finally reading SJM Throne of Glass series and I like it.,"I read all the reviews here. People tearing her work apart and saying it's terrible, cliche, the worst writing. But my friends LOVE the books and my one friend has re-read it multiple times (we are all late 20s/early 30s). Now I am a grimdark fantasy person or epic fantasy. I want thick worldbuilding, high stakes, terrible brutality. ASOIAF, Lies of Locke Lamora LotR, Sanderson novels, etc. But I wanted a quick easy read and figured that her books would be that considering they're YA/NA. 

And they are. But they're also good. Like yes there are flaws, where randomly she had weapons, or the worlds greatest assassin is 18??? And somehow still manages to be surprised more than once. There are also continuity errors I spotted which made me chuckle but I honestly don't remember them cause they're minor and not all too important. But boy I keep reading. She knows how to end a chapter so you just start the next one despite needing to do other things and planning to do them but then you're halfway through a chapter and oh what's one more. 

I ended up reading half the second book today when I intended to stop after 50ish pages. Two days ago I read 230 pages to finish the first book because I wanted to know what happened. Is SJM an amazing writer with eloquence and such description I cannot believe? No. Is her worldbuilding amazing and akin to Tolkien, Sanderson, etc.? No. But she knows how to tell a good story, I'm very intrigued about what's happening. I'm glad I gave it a shot and ignored all the reviews on here, it's like people hate fantasy that's written more for a woman. I love my thick, gritty fantasy but this is fun and easy and doesn't take five minutes to read a page because there are twelve new pieces of worldbuilding introduced and I like it. It's a good series to read if you want a break and to just breeze through something. And the romance is kind of fun, reminds me of what I loved to read when I was a teenager. I like that it's not central, it's not all smut and stuff, but she breaks up the intense plot scenes with romance chapters and you're like ""oh right, what's happening here now?"" 

I think it's worth a read honestly. I see why it's popular. Best fantasy ever? Not even close. Fun, easy, and interesting? Absolutlely.",Fantasy

Now is your chance to guess what books you think your fellow readers have included on their cards, as we reflect on a year of bingo reading. 

In previous years I've offered up some guesses of my own, but this year I'm mostly just going to pose some questions:

* Will Amina al-Sirafi sail away with the coastal/island setting square?
* Which Sanderson secret project will be the most popular book read for bingo?
* Was Saint Death's Daughter the most read book for a square, or just a book I have seen almost everyone recommend? (Ditto for The Spear Cuts Through Water - every time I see it recommended, I frantically refresh my library's waitlist).
* So what *did* everyone end up reading for the druid square?

One prediction I will make: Murderbot to take out the robot square, and go straight back to watching Sanctuary Moon.

1711392790.0,Tarvolon Reads a Magazine (or Two): Reviews of Clarkesworld and GigaNotoSaurus (March 2024),"Another month, another set of short stories to read. I’m spending more time dipping into assorted publications here and there—which I’ll review in another post—but I’m staying consistent with a couple of my favorites. So let’s dive into the March 2024 issues of Clarkesworld and GigaNotoSaurus. 

# Clarkesworld

If there’s any magazine I recommend regularly reading cover-to-cover, it’s Clarkesworld. The median story is entertaining, and they almost always have more that I love than that I dislike. They were especially excellent in 2023, with the literal four best short stories I read all year. But if there’s ever a month to dip in here and there, it’s March 2024. There’s still plenty to like, but there were a few misses mixed in as well, and quite a few stories where you can get a good sense of whether they’ll fit your style in the first few paragraphs. 

The opening story of the month is probably my favorite, **Hello! Hello! Hello!** by Fiona Jones. It’s told from the perspective of an alien intelligence happening on humanity for the first time, and the perspective is so disorienting that the piece becomes something of a puzzle, challenging the reader to match strange descriptions to familiar phenomena. It’s fun as a puzzle for the reader, though the other side of that coin is that it’s difficult to immerse in the narrative flow while puzzling out the strange descriptions. But that narrative flow does build as the story progresses, and it becomes something truly charming by the end—a wonderful debut!

**Phosphorescence** by Ben Berman Ghan is also strange, but differently so, telling a nonlinear tale of a machinist and a biologist seeking to influence various sects of people looking toward the future of humanity as Earth becomes increasingly uninhabitable. There’s a bit of conspiracy and a bit of romance, and it comes together reasonably well, but there’s not necessarily a “wow” moment of convergence; it’s just solid story pieces coming together into a solid story. 

I suspected I would not care for **Nine Beauties and the Entangled Threads** by D.A. Xiaolin Spires, and I did not. She’s a Clarkesworld regular, and her style has never quite clicked for me. The stories always feel ambitious, and sometimes beautiful, but they never fully grip me in the end, and I’m never completely sure why. That makes it hard to give a satisfying review, but I’d recommend readers familiar with her work to read or not read this entry based on how you’ve felt in the past. For new readers, this tale of a woman working for preservation of a forest, with her grandmother’s cryptic comments as a guide, is a perfectly good introduction. 

I also knew relatively early I wouldn’t care for the issue’s sole novelette, **A Brief Oral History of the El Zopilote Dock** by Alaya Dawn Johnson. I enjoy the oral history style, but the tale of a contemporary Underground Railroad created to smuggle inmates out of prisons in the white and Christian-supremacist states of the former Southern US felt quite a bit too didactic for my tastes. Clarkesworld doesn’t often publish pieces that feel like politics with a thin veneer of science fiction, but this seems to me an exception. Johnson is obviously a good writer, and there is a story here, about the escape of two prisoners integral to the movement, but I felt the balance of worldbuilding to story leaned too far to the former. It’s undoubtedly a harrowing world, but the story seems to hinge more on the reader finding the world both disturbing and plausible than it does on any central narrative thread. 

In contrast, I found myself quite charmed by the next story, and if I had another favorite in the issue, it was **One Flew Over the Songhua River** by Qi Ran, translated by Andy Dudak. It’s an oblique portrait of a brilliant scientist facing a mysterious and unprecedented threat in space…by way of a portrait of his bitter but oddly admiring ex-wife. It’s always interesting to see dramatic sci-fi moments told through the eyes of the bit players, and this is no exception, with a complicated character drama in the foreground and an exciting sci-fi plot in the background. Very worth a read for fans of stories centering the secondary characters. 

I also quite enjoyed **Her Body, the Ship** by Z.K. Abraham, which tells the story of someone who has lived their whole life on a generation ship, and their complicated feelings when it appears the ship might’ve finally reached its destination. It’s not always easy to find the lead relatable in the intensity of her desire to remain on the ship, but it’s another strong entry in the category of stories centering characters who wouldn’t usually be the leads. 

I was initially very intrigued by **Geminoid** by Malena Salazar Maciá, which opens with an AI continually slipping free from its programming as it tries to relate the main story. As it progressed, it turned into an “AI learning to be human” tale, with the narrator raised purely as an organ donor and being pushed beyond the rules by an adventuresome teenager with a dodgy heart. And while it’s certainly not a bad example of such a tale—there’s not much that’s actually bad in Clarkesworld—it’s a relatively common storyline, and for me, this one didn’t stand out from the crowd. 

Finally, **Swarm X1048 — Ethological Field Report: Canis Lupus Familiaris, “6”**  by F.E. Choe is…well, it’s a dog story, told in second-person through the eyes of a research swarm tasked to study post-apocalyptic Earth. Again, it’s reasonably well-told, but there’s not a lot to it beyond seeing the bond between researchers and dog in a desolate landscape. Fans of dog stories will doubtless enjoy this one, but I’ve never been partial to them myself. 

The non-fiction includes an announcement of the reader poll winners—not my votes, though the Best Short Story winner, “Better Living Through Algorithms,” did make my favorites list in 2023–and an article on the moral perils of using virtual reality to ethically raise livestock in captivity. The usual two interviews were this month with Izzy Wasserstein and Bodhisattva Chattopadhyay, and as usual, it added something to my TBR. Proto-science fiction isn’t exactly in my wheelhouse, but Chattopadhyay’s translated anthology of pre-1935 Bengali speculative fiction sounds like a worthy project and an interesting opportunity to read the sort of thing I wouldn’t ordinarily come across. I immediately asked my library to purchase a copy. 

# GigaNotoSaurus 

The sole longish story in this month’s GigaNotoSaurus was still a short story, and in fact a pandemic story. **The Fake Birdhouses of Springville** by Amy Johnson uses contactless delivery as a frame story for a tale of a woman with a love for small creatures in peril, one who took it upon herself to protect their spirits after their natural death. The reader never gets the context to accept the fantastical elements on much more than faith, but the story does a wonderful job evoking the context of a mundane town in which something extraordinary happens.",Fantasy

1711389142.0,Disability r/Fantasy Bingo 2023!," 

It's time for the yearly disability r/Fantasy Bingo Card! This is my fourth (and probably final) year doing this. All these books are hard mode and feature disabled protagonists. See [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/mhwndh/disbility_rfantasy_bingo_2020/), [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/tt6izu/disability_rfantasy_bingo_2021/) and [2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/11u4fxt/disability_rfantasy_bingo_2022/) here.

**Title with a Title** \- **The Two Doctors Gorski by Isaac Feldman (autistic)**  
*Follows a student of psychiatric magic and the darker side of academia.*

This is a very mature book and surprisingly short. It packs a big punch. Covers themes around mental health, abusive relationships, and the ethics of reading and altering minds. Big, messy topics but this book is neither big nor messy.

A very internalised tone for the narrative which might alienate some readers but I felt suited the character and subject matter well. The book is focused on character, rather than plot, and does that really well, but some might feel it's slow-paced as a result.

The protagonist is described as autistic and some imagery is quite synaesthetic in nature, but more noticeably she is coming to terms with the trauma of an abusive relationship. Elements of self-harm.

Personally I thought this book was great. A book that invites you to think.  
Rating: 4.5/5

**Superheroes - Baker Thief by Claudie Arseneault (asthma)**  
*A member of the police force hunts a rebellious superhero in a setting loosely based on francophone Canada.*

I loved this. It was fun, had a plot, and had a reasonably convincing relationship between the main characters (asexual and aromantic). 

Queernorm but explores discrimination in other forms. The superhero character is gender fluid - superhero identity is female, ""normal person"" identity is male, there's a bit of exploration around how hard the character finds that when they're forced into one identity for an extended period of time.

The character in the police has asthma and uses medication to control her symptoms, with mixed success. It all felt very realistic, despite the fantastical setting.  
Rating: 4/5

**Bottom of the TBR - The Vagrant by Peter Newman (mute)**  
*Swordsman crosses post-apocalyptic landscape with a goat and a baby.*

The book had a weird passive tone which made it hard to engage with. The main character was mute and you didn't hear his inner voice much either so I never really felt I was inside the main character’s head.

I think it would have worked well as a short story or novella, particularly for the atmosphere, but it didn't sustain my interest for a novel. 

Rating: 2/5

**Magical Realism or Lit Fantasy - The Moth Girl by Heather Kamins (fictional - lepidopsy)**  
*A teenager is diagnosed with a chronic illness that gives her moth-like qualities.*

Because it's a fictional disease, the reader is just as bewildered by the symptoms, tests and prognosis as the protagonist. Does a great job of demonstrating how scary and life-changing a diagnosis of a chronic disease can be.  
Rating: 3.5/5

**Young Adult - A Dragonbird in the Fern by Laura Rueckert (dyslexia)**  
*After Princess Jiara’s sister is assassinated, her betrothed arrives at court to marry Jiara instead. A murder mystery with plenty of political hijinks.*

Enjoyable YA with some twists although I would say the main plot is fairly obvious from about halfway through. Protagonist has undiagnosed dyslexia so she's dealing with a lot of internalised ableism. The dyslexia does have plot implications and there's a nice moment towards the end where she realises it's ok to ask for help with writing. Characterisation is perhaps a little simplistic for my tastes but works well in YA and the plot is nicely rounded off.

Rating: 2.5/5

**Mundane Jobs - Traitor by Krista D Ball (PTSD)**  
*Seven years ago Rebecca became an indentured servant to save her family. Now her past is catching up with her.*

This book generally feels quite tight although maybe things fall into place too easily in the early chunk of the book. Good characterisation. Sympathetic portrayal of PTSD and associated anxiety. Also LGBT and POC rep. However, towards the end the book gets messy - the protagonist is panicking throughout the climax which is realistic but gets irritating. Character growth has started but we are far from the end of a character arc. Very much a book waiting for you to read the sequel.

Rating: 3/5

**Published in 00s - Sir Apropos of Nothing by Peter David (mobility - leg)**  
*Lowborn Apropos becomes a reluctant knight. Satire and puns compete with the darker side of human nature.*

I didn’t love this book. It opens with a gang rape and events only get darker from there. It’s trying to send up the Glorious Days of Yore tropes but I personally didn’t find it funny enough. There are a lot of puns but those can feel quite forced, particularly as some take several pages to set up.

Apropos has a lame leg which does limit his activity but I would have liked to hear more about what he uses to adapt his activities (how does he mount a horse, for example).

Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if the book had been a little shorter and the pacing a little tighter but it was too rambling and too dark for me.  
Rating: 2.5/5

**Angels and Demons - When the Angels Left the Old Country by Sacha Lamb (mobility - feet)**  
*An angel and a demon leave their tiny shtetl to help a young emigrant who has left their town for America.*

This is very compelling and very Jewish. Character-driven to the extent that I didn't really care about the main plot (but the plot and the character arcs pay off in satisfying ways). Themes around immigration and prejudice. A couple of mentions of chronic foot pain due to the demon having to wear shoes despite not having feet made for the job. A small detail but a nice nod to the societal model of disability!

Rating: 5/5

**5 Short Stories - Disabled People Destroy Fantasy, Uncanny Magazine issue 30 (various)**  
*Short stories, essays and poems by disabled people and featuring disabled people.*

Let’s start with the short stories: there are a variety of takes on disability in fantasy. I particularly enjoyed Away With the Wolves, in which a werewolf with chronic pain manages it by switching into her wolf form. Some of the stories are darker than others and they’re all very different. The essays, again, are from a variety of viewpoints, and whether or not you agree with the content of each individual essay, they all make you think. Poetry isn’t really my area but some of it really hit home. But my favourite part of this was the interviews with the authors of the short stories – some in the magazine and some in the podcast. It’s fascinating to get their points of view and for some interviews it really helped me understand what I’d just read and where it came from.

In summary, come for the short stories but stay for the essays and interviews.

Rating: 3.5/5

**Horror - Deathless Divide by Justina Ireland (anxiety)**  
*Sequel to Dread Nation: zombies rose at Gettysburg and thanks to the Native and Negro Reeducation Act certain children need to attend combat school to learn to put down the dead.*

An appropriate sequel to Dread Nation. Gets pretty dark in places. Sometimes it feels like every fantasy book features a character with anxiety (see many of my other bingo books this year) but Ireland balances it well in the story: it is plot- and characterisation-relevant but it doesn't take over the whole story; Kate's anxiety is just there. There is also some coverage of an acquired disability, although a lot of the immediate aftermath (coming to terms with it) is skipped.

Rating: 3/5

**Self-pub or Indie Pub - Curses and Cousins by Helene Vivienne Fletcher (epilepsy and low blood pressure)**  
*Sequel to Familiars and Foes in which Adeline and her assistance dog are drawn into witchcraft when an evil ghost is unleashed on their town.*

Not quite as good as its prequel - the plot here was a little messier and fairly predictable - but the book portrays a pregnant character with a disability which is a real rarity in fantasy. Some lovely character development here and some discussion about the difficult balance of independence vs accepting help, especially in the context of a romantic relationship.

Rating: 2.5/5

**Middle East SFF - Your Wish is my Command by Deena Mohamed (depression)**  
*Follows three characters in a world where you can buy wishes.*

The world building is very interesting, particularly how colonialism has influenced the wish economy. The characters are well-developed with more nuance than you find in many graphic novels. The disability portrayal was a bit weird though: we have a protagonist (Nour) who wants to wish their depression away. The depression feels very realistic in its portrayal and in how hard it is to find help for it. Nour goes through a lot of character growth, identifying the problem, seeking help and working towards better mental health (which is shown as difficult). But then >!Nour actually does wish it away. Personally I found that quite jarring. !<There's also a character who has cancer and someone wants to use a wish to cure them, against their wishes. 

Overall I think the message of the book was ""wishes are not as simple as they're cracked up to be"" but some of the subtleties seem to have been lost in translation.

Rating: 3/5

**Pub 2023 - The Princess of Thornwood Drive by Khalia Moreau (paralysis and nonverbal, anxiety)**  
*After a tragic car accident, two sisters are trapped on opposite sides of reality: one in the modern world and one in the fantastical land of Mirendal.*

I really liked this! Two very different parallel stories, one with very gritty real-world problems (check trigger warnings before reading), and one in a fantastical land. They intersect cleverly and we get some point of view from paralysed and nonverbal Alyssa. A really interesting approach and well-executed**.**  
Rating: 4/5

**Multiverse and Alternative Reality - Unseelie by Ivelisse Housman (autistic)**  
*Twin sisters are caught up in a heist gone wrong.*

Some of the story choices are definitely an acquired taste (e.g. first person present tense narrative, calling the Unseelie changeling ""Seelie""). I wasn't sold on the love story - the love interest didn't seem very attractive despite the first person narrative and I didn't get a feel for much chemistry between them. The fae were generally well-done in that they felt very alien and a little bit evil.

I was very wary about picking up a book with an autistic changeling given the history of autistic children being treated as changelings, but this provides nice sensitive coverage. Seelie has a supportive family and some very close relationships, but there is also acknowledgement of her difficulties with interpersonal relationships, some mention of sensory overload (these were not always followed through e.g. says she wants to leave a noisy room but doesn't say why or try to leave), and a few episodes of loss of control which may be intended as autistic meltdowns.

However, the plot overall was fairly generic (heists, mysterious magic, slightly unconvincing romance) and I'm not sure I'd have picked the book up or finished it if it hadn't been for the autism representation.

Rating: 2.5/5

**POC author - The Sound of Stars by Alechia Dow (hypothyroidism and anxiety)**  
*A girl who risks her life for books and an alien who loves pop music have to work together to save humanity.*

Beyond the anxiety which she says is due to it, the hypothyroidism is almost completely ignored in the book even though Ellie is unmedicated for most of the time and should at least be tired. The plot is a bit sparse and a lot of the ending happens ""off screen"" so it feels very cheap and unsatisfying. The pacing was slow, it was hard to engage with the characters who felt flat (and yet the aliens didn't feel alien enough) which meant I wasn't on board with the love story at all. I put this down several times and it was a struggle to finish it.

Rating: 1/5

**Book club/readalong - The Spirit Bares Its Teeth by Andrew Joseph White (autistic)**  
*Trans boy Silas is diagnosed with a mysterious disease that causes madness and sent to finishing school.*

This broke me out of a reading slump: the writing got me absorbed very quickly. The plot was ok but not amazing. The characters were alright and the book, despite being YA, did not shy away from gore and many other horrors (check trigger warnings before reading, there are loads). That's the book's main strength: discussions around transphobia, ableism and misogyny. The ending of the story fell a little flat.

I enjoyed the book but it wasn't objectively amazing.

Rating: 3/5

**Novella - Magic Dreams by Ilona Andrews (visual impairment)**  
*Just a fun adventure, starring a blind protagonist who definitely shouldn't be allowed behind the wheel of a car.*

As with the other Kate Daniels books, Dali feels like a real person with a lot going on under the surface (and above the surface - Dali is a bit of a loose cannon!) with space to make mistakes like any other person.

Rating: 3/5

**Mythical beasts - Hummingbird by Natalie Lloyd (osteogenesis imperfecta - brittle bones)**  
*A mysterious hummingbird who can grant wishes arrives in 12-year-old Olive’s hometown just as she starts school.*

This is a middle grade book which explores the difficulties of finding your place (particularly at school) and the possibility of a magical cure. More would be a spoiler but it's explored thoughtfully**.**

Rating: 3/5

**Elemental magic - City of Dusk by Tara Sim (anxiety, needing aids to perform magic)**  
*Four powerful heirs work together to save their city from vengeful gods.*

The anxiety is constantly there but not explored in detail. However another character can't perform magic without musical instruments which is presented and explored like a disability.

Overall the book is long and a bit rambling. I found it hard to keep track of the main characters and there were too many plots going in too many different directions. Needed a tighter edit.

Rating: 2/5

**Myths and retellings - The Circus Rose by Betsy Cornwell (neurodivergence)**  
*A queer retelling of Snow White and Rose Red.*

The plot hasn't been developed much since the original fairy tale (and that was pretty thin) but the setting is lovely and the characters are fun too. There's a very slow chunk early on in the book but once I'd made it past the halfway point it flowed well.

Rosie is neurodivergent: she experiences sensory overload and her parts of the story are told in poetry (as opposed to her sister's in prose). Sadly this doesn't mesh too well with Ivory's story and often feels added on, particularly early in the book.

Disability-rep: I like that Rosie's neurodiversity is never clearly defined, just accepted: she doesn't quite fit into a diagnostic box but her family (and found family) aren't bothered by that. Similarly, the queer relationships (and there are a lot of them!) and the polyamory are just accepted within the circus. Bear is a princess in a male bear's body and fair warning, Ivory misgenders her throughout almost all of the book. It's a little different in the wider world: religious persecution abounds.

Overall there were good aspects but not enough of them. It was ok, and an easy read, but needed more plot and better cohesion between Ivory and Rosie's storytelling.

Rating: 2.5/5

**Queernorm Setting - A Taste of Gold and Iron by Alexandra Rowland (anxiety with panic attacks)**  
*Slow-burning queer romance amidst political investigations.*

The writing here is solid and so is the plot. I liked the worldbuilding - loosely based on the Ottoman Empire - particularly the discussions of the economy. One of the protagonists has panic attacks and we see the various ways he tries to manage these. My biggest criticism here is that the book is very tropey but that’s not always a bad thing.

Rating: 3.5/5

**Coastal or island setting - Shadebloom by Felicia Davin (autistic and prosopagnosia)**  
*Book 3 of the Gardener’s Hand trilogy. Start with Thornfruit: farmgirl Ev and mindreading spy Alizhan uncover a conspiracy in their city, set on a tidally locked planet.*

There is a lot of memory-wiping in this book and it's definitely used to excess. However,  Davin uses the worldbuilding of the previous books and overall brings the trilogy to a satisfying conclusion. I particularly liked how much of the conclusion hinged on a courtroom scene. 

I've talked before about how magic is used as an aid for Alizhan’s prosopagnosia in this series. Points for adding in some (temporary) brain injury representation and PTSD rep in addition to Alizhan's autism and prosopagnosia. There's also a Deaf side character and all Islanders speak both ""gesture language"" and ""spoken language"".

Rating: 3/5

**Druids - The Atlas Six by Olivie Blake (anxiety)**  
*Six magicians compete for a spot in the exclusive Alexandria Society.*

Too little plot. This book is trying to be character driven but because the characters are quite shallow it doesn't work. Libby has anxiety which is a difficult thing to portray convincingly without making a character irritating and Blake doesn't quite pull it off. 

Rating: 1.5/5

**Featuring robots - The Six by Mark Alpert (muscular dystrophy)**  
*Six dying teenagers are given the chance to be reborn as weaponised robots.*

I didn't love this but then again it's not the kind of thing I usually read. The characters were all very individual - sometimes a bit too stereotyped but generally distinctive enough. The plot hangs together well enough and pacing is fine. Personally I didn't love the ending.

The main character was an odd choice of protagonist: for most of the book I was wondering what was so special about him over the others in The Six. I particularly disliked the way his disability was handled (likewise those of his friends). His muscular dystrophy was the precipitant for the plot and this could have led into interesting discussions around euthanasia and assisted suicide... but it didn't. It felt like it was just being used as a cheap way to progress the plot.

Overall though, I think mostly I didn't like this book because I'm not the target audience.

Rating: 2/5

**Sequel - Heat Wave by TJ Klune (ADHD)**  
*Book 3 of The Extraordinaries - queer teenage superheroes.*

Funny but takes a long time for the plot to get going (with a very long section on enemas in the middle of this superhero story). I've talked before about Nick’s ADHD in this series, but I enjoyed how it’s shown as both a strength (creative solutions) and a weakness at different times in this book.

Rating: 2.5/5

**Discussion Points:**

A lot of the books I read this year featured characters with anxiety. Are there any disabilities that are over-/under-represented in fantasy? Why is this?

A protagonist’s disability can play into the plot of a book in various ways. Do you prefer incidental representation or plot-relevant representation? Why?

Have you read any books this year with interesting portrayal of disabilities?",Fantasy
1711388763.0,Finished Grace of Kings.. oh boy!,"After finishing it I can also join those people who say it is underrated. This book is a masterpiece!

I can understand why some people will struggle with this book considering the myriad of characters and places. I struggled with this too and a few times thought about giving up but the story and the writing kept me enough intrigued to keep reading and once the general plot line and characters are  settled, it becomes much easier. The writing is top notch and as a non native English speaker I found myself struggling with the abundance of high level  vocabulary, but having read it on my Kindle, a dictionary was at my disposal instantly. Also the character's list in the beginning of the book helped a lot with remembering them and reminding their role. After a while I no longer had to look at it. 

The plot is great, the twists and turns, the battles, the characters, the politics, the memorable quotes. This book for me is a 5/5 no doubt and reading that the next book is even better, makes me even happier.",Fantasy
1711387465.0,Mini Bingo Reviews - BIPOC Author Card,"Last year, only 5 out of 26 authors on my bingo card were BIPOC. One of my goals throughout 2023 was to read more diversely, so I decided to do a BIPOC author bingo card, filled with authors from a variety of backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultures. (If anyone isn't familiar, BIPOC stands for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color.)

Notably, I struggled the most with finding a good selection to pick from for the early 00s square, and most of what I did find leaned magical realism or YA as opposed to adult fantasy/sci-fi. I was surprised by just how many of the well-known BIPOC authors in SFF weren't published until after 2010. I think its a positive sign of how much the industry (and SFF in particular) has advanced in the last \~15 years.

While there are still improvements needed in the inclusivity of SFF, my own experience with this card reinforced what a rich variety of voices and stories are readily available if you only take the time to look for them. Below you'll find highlights and mini reviews for each of my picks!

# Highlights

**Blood Over Bright Haven by M.L. Wang** *- Self-published -* I'll be honest—I think I liked this one more than Sword of Kaigen. Wang is a master of creating flawed protagonists that you can't help rooting for. This story centers on two main characters, who come from very different backgrounds, uncovering something monstrous about their city and undergoing a test of personal convictions as they wrestle with what to do about it. Plus, throw in a cool magic system that seems loosely based on coding! (4.5/5)

*Read this if you love: Fullmetal Alchemist, flawed protagonists, magic academia*

**Shubeik Lubeik by Deena Mohamed** *- Set in Middle East -* This is an incredible graphic novel set in an alternate-reality Egypt, where magical artifacts (akin to djinn) found throughout the Middle East have been commodified by Western powers and turned into varying grades of expensive ""wishes"" (think top-shelf versus bottom-shelf liquor). The premise is so creative, but the real magic of this story is how Mohamed uses this set up to explore the inner lives of a small interlocking group of people as they face grief, mental illness, political and social marginalization, and other challenges. (4.5/5)

*Read this if you love: internal journeys, interlocking ensemble casts, stories about wishes*

**Silver Under Nightfall by Rin Chupeco** *- POC Author -* I think my love for fantasy stems from all the vampire fiction I read as a teen, and this book really brought me back to my roots in the best way. Our protagonist, Remy, is a vampire hunter who encounters a royal vampire couple from a neighboring kingdom on a diplomatic mission, and has to work with them to uncover an unfurling mystery. I'll put this out there ahead of time: this book is also pretty sexy (and it has a throuple hehe). (4.5/5)

*Read this is you love: Castlevania, romance with an actual plot, the love triangle is an actual triangle, vampire-on-vampire violence*

**Noor by Nnedi Okorafor** *- Mundane Job -* Our protagonist, AO, is a mechanic with some intense robotic body modifications in a futuristic Nigeria, and is forced to flee her home after a violent encounter in the market. I definitely need to read more Okorafor because I am forever impressed by how she's able to develop rich and engaging themes with creativity and nuance. I usually don't care that much about the world building of sci-fi settings but this one integrates so well with the overall plot and themes that I couldn't help being entranced. (4/5)

*Read this is you love: afrofuturism, on the run from the government, giant sand storms, eco-facism, disability representation*

# Mini Reviews

**Legendborn by Tracy Deonn** \- *Title with a Title* \- I loved the complex examination of power, race, and influence as it relates to magic and secret societies; it's a much needed deconstruction of the common tropes we see in YA stories like HP and Percy Jackson. (4/5)

*Read this if you love: secret societies, academic settings, (well done) love triangles*

**When Gracie Met the Grump by Mariana Zapata** \- *Superhero* \- So I went into this thinking it'd be a cute superhero romance, but instead I got 50% half-baked mafia romance and 50% that part in Twilight where Bella meets Edward's family. There was somehow no actual on page superhero-ing. (1.5/5)

*Read this if you love: grumpy/sunshine couple, miscommunication*

**Brown Girl in the Ring by Nalo Hopkinson** \- *Bottom of the TBR* \- Set in dystopian Toronto, this is a well-written but dark urban fantasy steeped in Caribbean mythology. I especially appreciated that the protagonist is a young, single mother with an infant. (4/5)

*Read this if you love: apocalyptic Canada, gods come to life, plucky grandmothers*

**The Last Dreamwalker by Rita Woods** *- Magical Realism -* This had a good set-up, centering on two Gullah Geechee women from coastal South Carolina who can walk in dreams (alternating POV between a modern woman and her enslaved ancestor); however, I found the plot a bit dry overall. (3/5)

*Read this if you love: South Carolina, historical/modern day split narrative, fantasy as a vehicle for social commentary*

**The Magnolia Sword by Sherry Thomas** *- Young Adult -* I loved that this Mulan retelling incorporated elements of historical China while still being a fun and fast-paced YA story. The romance, which is set up as rivals to lovers, fell a bit flat for me though. (4/5)

*Read this if you love: Disney's Mulan, sword fighting, crossdressing MC*

**Palace of Illusions by Chitra Banarjee Divakaruni** *- Published in the 00s -* A lovely, lyrical retelling of the Mahabharata from the perspective of one of the main female characters. The pacing on this was frustrating at times since many main events are summarized and time jumps happened frequently—hard to avoid considering the source material. (4/5)

*Read this if you love: Circe, Indian mythology, epics, feminist retellings*

**If Found Return to Hell by Em X. Liu** *- Angels/Demons -* I think I would have enjoyed this a bit more if I hadn't listened to it; I wasn't crazy about the narration. Overall this is a fluffy novella told in second person that also features some humorous, magic-corporate-desk-job elements. (2.5/5)

*Read this if you love: wholesome possession, found family, demon prince is actually a softy*

**The Wishing Pool and Other Stories by Tananarive Due -** *Short Stories -* An excellent collection of short stories. Most fall in the horror genre but there's also some sci-fi/post-apocalyptic stories thrown in. Due has shot up my list of authors I need to explore. (4/5)

*Read this if you love: Jordan Peele, Florida, horror as a vehicle for social commentary,*

**Certain Dark Things by Silvia Moreno-Garcia** *- Horror -* Unfortunately, this one fell a bit flat for me, likely due to having too many POVs. The freshest element was the exploration of non-European vampire mythos—in this case, an Aztec Tlāhuihpochtli vampire, which shapeshifts into a bird. (2.5/5)

*Read this if you love: Aztec and Meso-American mythology, noir, GMO dogs*

**To Shape a Dragon's Breath by Moniquill Blackgoose** \- *Published in 2023* \- I liked the premise of this, but my main issue with it is the MC, who is a teen girl, talks like a college student writing an essay on colonialism. And, despite being very impulsive, every decision she makes is somehow the best. Maybe it was too YA for me. (3/5)

*Read this if you love: indigenous fantasy, dragon school, light poly-romance*

**The Spear Cuts Through Water by Simon Jimenez** \- *Multiverse* \- A masterpiece in unique storytelling, this story is told in first-, second- and third-person POV and features a violent but beautiful story of two people who come together to deliver a goddess across the country. (4/5)

*Read this if you love: MM Romance but make it literary, unique storytelling frames, deadly quests across strange lands*

**The Last Dragoners of Bowbazar by Indra Das** *- Book Club -* This was an enjoyable novella with lyrical prose and well-developed themes around immigration, dual-identity, and belonging. However, the plot was a bit slow and didn't fully grab me. (3.5/5)

*Read this if you love: lyrical fantasy, allegories, magic castles, cosmic dragons*

**Goddess of Filth by V. Castro** *- Novella -* On the one hand, there's some truly rad moments in this story about a group of Chicana teenagers who accidentally summon a scary goddess. However, I felt like the twist wasn't foreshadowed well and the ending fell a bit flat for me. (2.5/5)

*Read this if you love: The Craft, ouija boards, nightmare goddesses, women*

**Untethered Sky by Fonda Lee** *- Mythical beasts -* I'm myself a birder, so the Rocs were definitely the main draw for me. Overall, this is more of an internal journey than an epic journey but still fun. (3/5)

*Read this if you love: GIANT BIRDS!, nature is deadly, ""How to Train Your Giant Bird""*

**The Rise of Kyoshi by F.C. Yee** *- Elemental Magic -* What better pick for the elemental magic square than an Avatar book? And boy does it deliver. Absolutely loved this origin story for one of the most infamous (and tall) Avatars, the one and only: Kyoshi. (4.5/5)

*Read this if you love: ATLA, light sapphic romance, can't levitate a pebble but can destroy a mountain*

**Pahua and the Soul Stealer by Lori M. Lee** *- Myths/Retellings -* I have a good friend who's Hmong, so I picked this up hoping to learn a bit about Hmong mythology. It's written for a younger audience, but I found the MC easy to root for and the setting very rich in detail. (3.5/5)

*Read this if you love: Percy Jackson, myths in the modern world, middle grade fiction*

**Bruising of Qilwa by Naseem Jamnia** *- Queernorm -* This honestly wasn't my cup of tea, and I think it was partly because the MC uses a lot of medical jargon to describe people. It grossed me out a bit to frequently be told about different characters' lymph nodes. (2/5)

*Read this if you love: medicine/doctors, mysterious plagues, queer representation*

**Black Sun by Rebecca Roanhorse** *- Coastal/Island -* This book started so strong for me, but the ending felt rushed. I think part of this is I struggle with multi-POV narratives like this one because the individual storylines tend to feel half baked. (3/5)

*Read this if you love: GIANT BIRDS!, Pre-Colombian American setting, cities built into cliffs*

**The Jumbies by Tracey Baptiste** *- Druids -* This was a delightful Middle Grade horror story that reminded me a lot of Coraline. Officially, the MC is not a druid, but her powers are that she can sing magic into oranges, so I'm going to count it. (3/5)

*Read this if you love: Caribbean mythology, spooky islands, young group of friends teaming up*

**Klara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro** *- Robots -* For me, the hardest part of this book was being inside the head of someone who lacks curiosity and self-possession. I think that's part of the point of the story, but I still found it a frustrating read. (2.5/5)

*Read this if you love: focused character studies, morality of AIs, robots that aren't evil*

**The Broken Kingdoms by N.K. Jemisin** \- *Sequel* \- Really enjoyed this follow-up to *The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms,* and I plan to finish out the trilogy soon. Oree is a fantastic protagonist: strong, determined, compassionate, flawed, and I loved seeing her relationship with a certain golden boy grow over the novel. (4/5)

*Read this if you love: protagonist taking in homeless gods, giant tree city, disability representation*

1711387254.0,"What are your favorite books (standalone or series) with small, self-contained settings?","Right now I'm reading *Perdido Street Station* by China Mieville and I'm enjoying how the story takes place in just one really fleshed out city. Ideally, I'm looking for something even smaller, like a tightknit family drama within one castle, for example. 

*Piranesi* also checked this box for me, but most fantasy seems to sprawl across the further reaches of the lands and worlds the story exists within.

&#x200B;",Fantasy
1711379532.0,Why aren't there more creative alternate history worlds?,"Alt history is either ""What if the Germans won WWII"", or ""What if the Roman Empire never fell"", etc. Why aren't there more such worlds where there are more unique PODs that radically change the world, where many new countries exist and many of the existing ones don't. There is so much worldbuilding potential for such settings. They don't have to be just realistic either, and have their share of advanced tech and supernatural elements.",Fantasy
1711379185.0,The First Law Trilogy So Far,"I’m two books into the first law trilogy, and I can say it’s just okay so far? Maybe this just isn’t my type of book, but I feel myself really interested to see where it will go, but not really interested at all at where it’s currently at.

The plot lines in this book bores me at several different turns, and Bayaz and crew spending the whole book on a journey just to get nothing out of it was not what I expected, and it wasn’t something I enjoyed either.

Being that I only have the last book left, Im gonna put my faith in it and say that it’ll probably be my favorite of the bunch, but right now I honestly don’t think too highly of these books.",Fantasy

1711376401.0,2023 Bingo - A Hard Year for Hard Mode - Mini Reviews,"  

https://preview.redd.it/rspborgmohqc1.png?width=1077&format=png&auto=webp&s=0583af41e5a0a491967f2fce234c8b52035f923c

My third year of Reddit Bingo, and the hardest one so far. My reading this year had to fight for time with more time spent outdoors cycling, so overall reading was down about 25%. And while my Bingo adventure started out excited and fresh, I lost all momentum several times when I stumbled through some mediocre or outright bad books. Fair warning, my overall reviews this year likely come off as cycnical and very critical. 

Link to the official bingo post - [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/128oxqt/official\_rfantasy\_2023\_book\_bingo\_challenge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/128oxqt/official_rfantasy_2023_book_bingo_challenge/) 

* Title in Title - Iron Gold by Pierce Brown (Hard Mode)
   * After having mixed feelings about the end of the original trilogy, I was lukewarm going into this. But Pierce Brown sure knows how to write a banger of a book. And the audiobook impresses even more this time around, with more POV characters and thus more narrators. I love the direction of having a different accent for each color. The book is as brutal and grim as the first series, and I'm all in for more. 4/5, will keep on with the series.
* Superheroes - The City we Became by N. K. Jemisin (Hard Mode)
   * What a fun nontraditional superhero story. A love letter to New York, and more broadly to the concept of cities and culture. Not afraid to show off stereotypes, while at the same time both playing to their strengths and subverting them entirely. I don't feel that the book needed to set up a sequel and was perfectly satisfying on its own. But I'll read it anyway, because the tone and pacing are spot-on. 4/5, likely to read the sequel.
* Bottom of TBR - The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller (Hard Mode)
   * I was extremely excited for this book after thoroughly enjoying Circe last year. Song of Achilles comes so highly rated, but I think Miller learned a lot from writing this book, making Circe a much better read. Some of my biggest gripes come from the source, though Miller still could have done something to make Achilles be an interesting character. The whole concept of him being ""the greatest warrior in Greece"", when he was 12 years old, had never been in a battle, wasn't taught a drop by Chiron, and didn't kill a man until more than a decade later, really fell flat. And with a main character that's so uninteresting, the book was an absolute slog for the first 2/3. Things started to pull together at the end but was too little too late. 3/5
* Magical Realism - Piranesi by Susannah Clarke (Hard Mode)
   * I knew absolutely nothing about this book going on and found it to be an absolute delight. The allegory and concept of the world were extremely evocative, and the prose was tight and quirky in a way that really drew me in. All in all, an excellent book. 5/5
* Young Adult - Unseelie by Ivelisse Housman (Hard Mode)
   * I picked this from the recommendations thread, and think I came up with a real stinker. The writing, character development, romance, etc. are all just baseline bland and cliched. The character motivations are paper thin, and the characters never actually attempt to make any progress towards the climax. In fact, the book just teleports them there on a whim for no reason at all. Then, right as things should be building to a crescendo, the book teleports us out again, starts a new plot that's utterly out of nowhere, teleports us back in, and just kind of ends. This book was an absolute chore to read, and I found nothing redeeming here. 1/5, will not read the sequel.
* Mundane Job - Night Watch by Terry Pratchett (Hard Mode)
   * I had been reading the Pratchett books in order and loved the original audiobook narrator. After giving a few of the later books a try with the new narrator, I just couldn’t get into it. So Night Watch had been sitting on my list for a long time. And boy am I glad that I got back in. Vimes has always been an outstanding character, and getting to see him feature in a book that's more introspective than outright comical is a real treat. Pratchett's writing is as neat and clever as ever, but really leans into some darker material than usual in this one. 5/5, will keep reading the series.
* Published in the '00s - Curse of Chalion by Lois McMaster Bujold (Hard Mode)
   * The final book I read for the Bingo card, and I was getting worried since I started it halfway into March. I'd had a pretty mediocre-to-bad year of reading and was almost to the point of just not wanting to finish Bingo. But I'm glad I did because this was an excellent book to wrap up with. I'd only ever read Bujold's Vorkosigan saga prior to this (which I adored) and had no idea what to expect from her when it comes to fantasy. But I was treated with a very tight, well-paced, extremely detailed novel. Content warnings aside, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this one to just about anyone. 5/5, would read more.
* Angels and Devils - Small Miracles by Olivia Atwater (Hard Mode)
   * At first, I was turned off by this book, as it felt like it was trying way too hard to be Pratchett. That footnotes, the obvious inspiration from Good Omens, the overall tone and comedy. It all just felt like a weak pastiche. But as I got over that, I came to like the book quite a lot, and feel like it hit some good emotional notes that make it stand on its own feet. 4/5
* 5 Short Stories - I, Robot by Isaac Asimov (Hard Mode)
   * Having read the Foundation series, I had come to the conclusion that I didn't find Asimov's books particularly enthralling as entertainment, but they were academically rewarding. I, Robot hits a lot of the same notes. Many of the short stories are redundant with one another, so it could be difficult to slog through at times. But still very interesting seeing where things came from. 3/5
* Horror - The Luminous Dead by Caitlin Stirling (Hard Mode)
   * This book just never clicked for me. Conceptually it sounded great, but in practice it just ended up being a completely unlikeable protagonist, making awful decisions, repeatedly trusting someone who has proven themselves to be untrustworthy over, and over, and over again. I swear, the two characters had the same exact fight about eight times over the course of the book and there was never so much as a drop of character growth between them. The setting had so much potential, but the narrative really made it a slog. 2/5
* Self/Indie Published - Neom by Lavie Tidhar (Hard Mode)
   * Unfortunately, I didn't write any notes on this one at the time of reading. I did the audiobook while on a bike ride, and was too focused on riding to really internalize any thoughts on it. I recall it being short and enjoyable, if a little jarring in its jumps at times. But the core concept of the book was interesting, and the worldbuilding was beautiful. I have some gorgeous images that I can't get out of my head. 3/5
* Set in the Middle East - The Stardust Thief by Chelsea Abdullah (Hard Mode)
   * Originally on my bingo card for last year's 202 publish square, I ended up skipping it after bouncing off the first chapter. With my card having a big middle east subtheme, I decided to give it another crack. And it's very much an OK book. Nothing outstanding, and pretty tropey for my likes. Other than being around sand and using ""djinn"" and ""efreet"" for their magical creatures, basically nothing about this really draws heavily on the middle eastern setting. Also suffers from a big dose of ""author debuts with book 1 of a trilogy"" syndrome, with a big cliffhanger ending. Hard to want to commit to any more books when I don't know if the author can actually pull off an ending. 3/5
* Published in 2023 - The Daughters of Izdihar by Hadeer Elsbai (Hard Mode)
   * What do you get when you take the basic premise of The Once and Future Witches, magic from Avatar: the Last Airbender, and writing with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer? A book that's far less than the sum of its parts. Oh, and to top it all off we have another bingo square for ""debut work where the author sets up a series without having a satisfying book"". 2/5, will not revisit the series.
* Multiverse - The Frugal Wizard's Handbook for Surviving Medieval England by Brandon Sanderson (Hard Mode)
   * I got stuck with a physical copy of this book (which would not normally make it on my to-read list) due to wanting the three Cosmere novels in the Sanderson Kickstarter. So what the heck, it matches a category and I have it. Might as well read it. My biggest advice for this book is to read the physical book, or at least ebook. The audiobook was perfectly good, but the design and art in the physical book was gorgeous. I think experiencing it that way would have really drawn me in more. Other than that, it was pretty standard fare for Sanderson stuff. 3/5
* POC Author - Ninefox Gambit by Yoon Ha Lee (Hard Mode)
   * Not a lot to say about this one. Read as an audiobook, and really didn't get much out of it. A lot of effort is put into trying to present a complex political landscape, lore about their technology/magic, etc., but when none of the characters or factions are in any way interesting or engaging all of that just falls flat. No effort was put into explaining why different calendars make technology work different, so all technology/magic is just technobabble with no weight behind it. I can't think of a single memorable scene from the book. 2/5, will not read any sequels.
* Book Club or Read Along - Jagannath by Karin Tidbeck (Hard Mode)
   * I hadn't picked anything for this square until January, and just decided to leap in with whatever was in the club. Jaganaath was a very weird, often gross, but usually rewarding treat. A short book, with a dozen or so short stories from a Swedish author. Some stories are translated from the original language, others were originally published in English. Of the dozen or so stories, most are hits with only a couple of duds for me. The writing itself can be interesting, as you look at each story through the lens of whether it was written in Swedish or English. 4/5
* Novella - One Day All This Will Be Yours by Adrian Tchaikovsky (Hard Mode)
   * My favorite read of the year. Short, sweet, absolutely enthralling, acerbically witty, and just an unforgettable read. I had the benefit of listening to this audiobook, narrated by the author, with my wife on a road trip. And then again later in the year with a friend because I needed to share it. Tchaikovsky absolutely nails the performance for the world weary, jaded protagonist, and I recommend the audiobook wholeheartedly. It's a very interesting contrast to This is How You Lose the Time War, another great short story, and something I would recommend reading back-to-back. 5/5
* Mythical Creature - The Last Unicorn by Peter S Beagle (Hard Mode)
   * Another I, Robot situation. I can recognize why this book is important in the vernacular of the genre, and I appreciate that people adore it. But for me, it felt like a book where characters did a lot of things, and nothing happened. The worldbuilding is kind of flat compared to modern standards, and there's a liberal dose of deus ex throughout. 2/5
* Elemental Magic - Waybound by Will Wight (Hard Mode)
   * Having read books 3-11 in a week while down with Covid, I was kind of on the hook to finish the series. There was a lot to wrap up in one book, and it suffers a bit from scope creep near the end. The plot was just a bit too fast to be truly enjoyable. But as a capstone to a popcorn series, it was satisfactory. 3/5
* Myths and Retellings - The Witch's Heart by Genevive Gornichec (Hard Mode)
   * The fifth or sixth ""modern retelling of classic mythology"" book I've read in the last few years, and a fairly good entry. I still think Circe stands a head above the rest of the genre, but this might be a solid second place for me. This and Kaikeyi feel almost like sibling novels, being about the mother/wife of important mythological characters, rather than the big names, and carrying a big dose of feminism to boot. Lends some great perspective to these sorts of myths, and not being Greek is a breath of fresh air. 4/5
* Queernorm - Saint Death's Daughter by C.S.E Cooney (Hard Mode)
   * This was a fairly charming book, and among the best reads on this year's card. Good pacing, plot that isn't too predictable, and fun prose. The book does a great job of just mentioning and never drawing attention to its worlds open acceptance of non-binary people and non-heterosexual/monogamous relationship. Up until about halfway, that is, when there's an out-of-nowhere chapter where everyone is in drag and it's made clear that giant orgy parties are the norm in this world. Which is all good and fun, but it kind of just sticks out as a weird sore thumb against the rest of the book that's so much more subdued and subtle in its acceptance. 4/5, will read the sequel when it comes out.
* Coastal Setting - The Adventures of Aminal Al-Sirafi by Shannon Chakraborty (Hard Mode)
   * A book that took me like eight months to read. Not bad by any means, but the first half of the book just never pulled me in. Once I got to the back half, the momentum got me to finish it in a week. A fairly fun pirate story, and not trying to be anything grand or deep. Feels a little too much like a video game in its ""wander around finding party members in different locations "" plot. 3/5, may or may not read the sequel.
* Druids - The Greenhollow Duology by Emily Tesh (Hard Mode)
   * A mild cheat here, as I've actually got two novellas here (Silver in the Wood and Drowning Country) counting as one square. But they're often bundled together as an omnibus and I frankly needed to squeeze in this last square with basically no time left in March. I don't have anything particular to praise in the books, but also have no complaints either. 3/5, would read more because I just love novella audiobooks on weekend trips.
* Robots - System Collapse by Martha Wells (Hard Mode)
   * I adore the Murderbot series, and was very stoked that another full length novel was coming out. Unfortunately, it's probably the weakest in the series for me. Stripping the main character of all of their more unique traits to humanize them and create vulnerability is kind of unnecessary when the entire series has been doing those things while still having fun with a cyborg. The trauma/mental health aspects of the book feel more like lip service than actual content, and that always rubs me the wrong way. 3/5, will keep on with the series.
* Sequel - The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien (Hard Mode)
   * A re-read for me, of a book I haven't read in over a decade. I thoroughly enjoyed Serkis's narrations of Hobbit and Fellowship, so this was already coming up in my queue. Not much to say about the book itself, as everything's been said a million times by a million readers. Serkis's performance is excellent. A lot more walking and scenery than I remembered, and way more than in Fellowship. 4/5",Fantasy
1711373436.0,First Time Bingo Reviews 2/5,"6. Mundane Jobs/Slice of Life. Under the Whispering Door by T. J. Klune 3/5 B-


So I’m not sure if this counts as “slice of life” or not (pun only slightly intended). I think this book is one that will be a big hit or meh depending on your particular sense of humor. The humor was a miss for me. It was cheesy in a way that made me groan, but this is purely subjective so I’m trying not to dock points. It felt like a lot was in the realm of a non-Michael Scott “That’s what she said” joke. I like the concept of a stage (tea shop) readying yourself to depart your previous life for the afterlife. The romantic subplot is fairly telegraphed though I don’t think the author was trying to hide anything. Maybe my expectations are too high as some of the best romantic subplots I’ve read over the past few years have been gay/lesbian, but this one just felt…fine. I honestly don’t have a ton to say about this one though. Some flaws, but nothing standing out as objectively terrible. Some really nice, heartfelt moments, but nothing that really wowed me. I think, if you are on the fence, see if there is a free sample first. If you like the humor, you’ll probably really enjoy this book. If you roll your eyes or groan, skip this one. I must admit, I’m more hesitant now to read The House By The Cerulean Sea which I believe is considered his best.



7. Published in 2000s- Od Magic by Patricia McKilip 3.5/5 B+


This one was an od one for me (well aren’t I clever) and one I was really on the fence between A- and B+. I found myself loving several of the individual elements of this book, but found the book as a whole largely uninteresting. It’s hard to explain; I just never felt myself gripped by the story, but I absolutely love her writing style. The beginning description of Brenden first unknowingly discovering magic during long sojourns in solitude, observing nature to barely cope with the grief of losing his parents, and the toll his grief took on the loved ones around him was just heartbreaking and beautiful. The characters as a whole were good, the world-building was fine for the admittedly narrow focus on a specific slice of a world. There were just so many plot lines that were introduced that I would have preferred to be the main focus of the book. Brenden learning magic, mending that grief and his relationships, re-emerging from his solitude, and coming to forgive himself would have been a fantastic central focus. Man do I wish that would have been the book. A villain-less book about grief and mending would have been so well set up by the intro and well-suited to her overall writing style. Following the princess as she navigates a relationship with her cold, distant betrothed who we were told only became this way studying magic would have been another, or the budding romance between a magician’s daughter and the son of the man who wants to shut the magician down. All of these stories were touched on, but never really dove deep enough for me and the power/control vs wildness/freedom broader theme as the focus just didn’t really interest me. Still, I would happily read another book by her. I really do love her writing style, this was just regrettably a miss for me.



8. Angels and Demons- Good Omens Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman. 5/5. S


This was my second Terry Pratchett book and about my seventh Neil Gaiman book, because I for some reason, even though I don’t love Neil Gaiman, I just really want to like his books more than I do and refuse to give up. This was an absolute delight. It is a masterful English satire about an unlikely friendship between an angel and demon trying to prevent the Armageddon, because they’ve grown to love Earth. I love the relationship between Crowley and Aziraphale and love each character individually. I can’t actually think of a single character I didn’t enjoy. It was also funny enough to make me laugh out loud a few times much to the confusion of everyone around me as they slowly edged a bit farther away. I’m now torn between watching the tv series, for which I have some consternation given Amazon’s track record with WoT and RoP, which I put generally on par with the Eragon and the live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender movies, or taking a drive and listening to what I can only assume will now be my best of Queen CD.



9. Short story anthology- The Wind’s Twelve Quarters by Ursula K. Le Guin. 5/5 S


Holy shit Ursula was an amazing writer. This is an anthology of short stories from the entirety of Ursula K. Le Guin’s career. All in all, I loved this. These were not all equal, but none are bad and some are truly excellent. I believe she also compiled these in part to show her evolution as a writer, so you kind of expect a difference in quality. I am so glad I read this. I hadn’t appreciated her depth as a writer from Earthsea, which I thought of as beautiful bones in need of some flesh. This gives more insights into her thinking and philosophy and impressed me with her depth as a person. She still has probably my favorite prose of any author. She’s a perfect example of the difference between diction and prose. Her words are often fairly simple and approachable, yet deep and beautiful and she has an excellent economy of words. I don’t know why, but my favorite example was, “Grey and swollen as the web-spinner of ruined houses, he turned and went blundering toward the cellars where he hid from daylight” describing a drunkard father of a noblewoman in his now-destitute house. My only complaint is that the endings were often very abrupt and underwhelming in the earlier stories, but others were fantastic so it’s a bit of a wash for me. Ranking from most to least favorite: The Day Before The Revolution, Vaster Than Empires And More Slow, Field of Vision, Nine Lives, The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas, The Masters, Winter’s King, Semley’s Necklace, Rule of Names, The Good Trip, Word of Unbinding, April In Paris, Darkness Box, The Darkness Below, Things, A Trip to the Head, The Direction of The Road. I would highly recommend this if you liked Earthsea, like more philosophical works, want to read a master in prose.



10. Horror- The Library on Mount Char 4.5/5 A



 I’m not sure if this comes as horror or dark fantasy nor where exactly that line is. This book was at once both excellently written and deeply disturbing. To give my brief endorsement; I feel like this book is what I always want Neil Gaiman novels to be. It centers around a group of children violently orphaned in a small town and raised by a brutal god-like being they refer to as Father to master separate domains of his power and one child’s plot to get revenge for their cruel upbringing. If you are familiar with Diablo II, reading this book kind of made me feel like I was the old man following the warrior possessed by Diablo. You know Carolyn (main character) has some cunning scheme and gradually get insights into both her scheme, her history, and her nature as you watch her confidently executing it. I found this fascinating and was surprised to feel satisfied at the end. It’s not perfect. No book is. But it felt very original and masterfully executed. I’m not a big fan of the dark fantasy or horror genres, and there were a few scenes that were a bit much for me, but this is one of the best standalone books I’ve read in a while. I will circle back to my intro as a warning though; it is a very disturbing book.",Fantasy

1711364935.0,I'm looking for something similar to Memoirs of Lady Trent but more fantastical.,"I've read some of the books in the Memoirs of Lady Trent series because dragons are really interesting and the concept in general seemed like a nice change of pace to the more typical fantasy stories I normally read. I think the books are good but they are also extremely grounded and lack fantastical and magical elements that I usually look for in stories. 

So I'm now looking for books that have a similar concept, that being a scholar travelling the world, exploring new places and studying Dragons or other mythical creatures, but in a more explicitely magical setting. It doesn't need to be extreme high magic but just more overtly fantastical than the very grounded world of Lady Trent.

**Mundane Jobs: Lock In by John Scalzi**  

Set in a not to distant future in which a plague has caused millions of people to become locked in after their brains nervous system is damaged, causing them literally to be locked in their own bodies. To counter this, a lot of research has been done to help people locked in by giving them online virtual reality spaces to interact, by making android models for them to interact with society in and also via integrators. Integrators are those who caught the virus and while they did not become locked in, their brain was changed enough for them to allow those locked in to go inside their bodies and pilot them for a while. Naturally it is all very well regulated, but…well… there are always people pushing the boundaries of technology, regulations and morals. This is a murder mystery about Chris Shane during his first week as an FBI agent unravelling a series of peculiar murders involving lock in syndrome in the changing political environment. Scalzi writes stark, easy prose which I appreciate. It was an interesting portrait of a society changing and adapting to new realities, and I liked the protagonist who was well aware of his privilege as the child of very rich and influential parents.

**Published in the 00s: The Jaguar Knights by Dave Duncan**

This one was a shock as I expect Duncan’s to be rollicking good adventures of romance, peril and sappy happy endings. It started like this as well, with the protagonist of Wolf and his tragic past being slowly revealed as his burgeoning romance with Dolores the inquisitor blossomed in the first third. Dolores herself allowed us a closer and hence more sympathetic look at the Inquisitors as well, who have tended to be portrayed as villains or merely creepy in previous books due to the nature of the magics they use to allow them to do their important work of spycraft for the good of the Crown of Chivial. The middle third of the book continues the usual rollicking good adventure as the cast goes to a foreign nation to discover the sorcerous secrets of El Dorado, a new land, and attempt to make contact amid many new cultures and a war going on. The last third, as it becomes clear the terrible methods the sorcerers of El Dorado use to extract their power, it becomes tragic as compounding disasters occur forcing Wolf to decide what he is and isn’t willing to do to save those he loves. The ending is bittersweet with an epilogue showing that despite the terrible things endured, life managed to go on and become good for those who survived. Still recommended, and the fact that Duncan was able to do a bittersweet adventure romance is really a testament to his skill.

**Angels and Demons: The Angel of the Crows by Katherine Addison**

A loving homage to Sherlock Holmes in a world where angels, vampires, werewolves and other supernatural creatures exist. The viewpoint character is J.H. Doyle, a doctor from Afghanistan who was discharged after they had an encounter with a fallen angel, causing their leg and essence to be wounded. To save money they move in with the angel Crow, who has taken unusual and controversial steps by angel standards to keep their individuality. The book is basically short vignettes of the pair of them solving crimes (themselves homages to Sherlock Holmes stories) interweaved between Jack the Ripper doing his crimes while Addison builds the growing friendship between Crow and Doyle as well as her world. I don’t know much about Sherlock Holmes at all but still adored this book and hope for a sequel as I was so sad about leaving the characters. My favourite this year.

**5 Short Stories: A Liaden Constellation Volume 5 by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller**

This far into the series you have to be an invested fan of the Liaden Universe to get the most out of these. Fortunately I am. I enjoyed more stories of Don Eyr and his friends, which are only being told in the short story volumes. It was nice seeing characters from novels who didn’t fit into any novels have their own stories and chances to deepen relationships. It was nice seeing villains getting redemption and new lives making them happier. It was interesting seeing the early colonization of the new planet introduced in the latest novel. And of course there were a few one off stories from new characters in the universe. If you are already an invested fan of the Liaden Universe all up to date I heartily recommend. New readers, try one of the earlier novels first.

**Horror: Night's Edge by Maggie Shayne, Barbara Hambly and Charlaine Harris**

 Three horror romance novellas published by Harlequin, which I picked up because I knew two out of three of them are good authors. Reading it confirmed this. 

Maggie Shayne: Her Best Enemy: The author not worth reading unless Harlequin Mills and Boons style romance is your primary genre of choice. I have a spurious unresearched feeling Maggie Shayne is primarily a romance writer as she was way more interested in allowing the main characters to snip and wangst at each other in a token fashion before the ridiculously contrived sexy scenes than the horror plot of the haunted house. I did like the idea of a genuine psychic who truly believed for most of the story he was a fraud performing a public service for nervous unhappy people who won’t go to a therapist though. 

Barbara Hambly: Someone Else’s Shadow. Another haunted building story but done much better, dripping in atmosphere. Over the façade of the romance and trying to save a teenager from the haunted building is a lovely story about those who pursue art as a career out of love despite knowing it will mean financial insecurity and a woman trying to move on after separating from an addict partner who then overdosed. Probably the story in here with the broadest appeal. 

Charlaine Harris: Dancers in the Dark. Set in the Sookie Stackhouse universe in which vampire have revealed themselves to society and made a niche as a minority, this one plays up the romance more than the Hambly book and does a twist on the horror, making the vampires the good guys and the bringer of the horror, violence and despair human. I liked it as much as the Hambly story, but would probably recommend it more for those who like romance, urban fantasy and Charlaine Harris. ",Fantasy

1711342381.0,How do you define spoilers?,"I keep getting knocked and reported for spoilers even though I’m referencing broad stroke details or synopsis, even tags; I don’t understand how giving tags for a book is spoilers, as long as the details don’t “spoil” the plot or characters or anything it’s not spoilers.

Technically spoilers for Harry Potter:
If I say Harry Potter has to deal with an escaped criminal in one book, is that spoilers? It’s the whole theme of the second book, meaning it’s not spoilers it’s just a synopsis.

I was curious how other people define spoilers, my sister thinks it’s literally any detail, but to me if it isn’t important to the plot or if it is part of widely known knowledge, it isn’t spoilers, like if you said Game of Thrones has dragons, that’s not spoilers even though it’s important to the plot because it’s a widely known thing and it’s a tag for the series.

I got in trouble for talking about a book series and saying “he goes to prison in book 3 unjustly and spends most the book there” in response to someone asking about the tone of the book, and it was flagged as spoilers even though that’s the Amazon synopsis of the book. And what I said didn’t have any how or why, but to be fair this is on the higher end of what I would almost consider spoilers since it is part of the plot, but since it’s part of the synopsis I consider it fair game.",Fantasy
1711341634.0,A truly hardcore book where the evil mage wins and the good guys don't?,"Almost every book I read, you have a good guy or set of good hero's, trying to do the right thing.

Your always rooting for the good guys, or the kid who suddenly found out he has powers. The downtrodden hero who was abused or wronged in some way, etc.

Even a series of books where he travels the world and just unloads hurt and evil, everywhere he goes?

It made me wonder how many of them were actually decent people who were being misguided by the antagonist.

That said its sometimes flabbergasting how the mooks still support the antagonist no matter how depraved/unhinged they are or how badly they mistreat their mooks (Ex: Galactic Empire/First Order from Star Wars, Cyclonia from Storm Hawks, Clarke Regime from Babylon 5, Cersei from Game of Thrones).

Are there any works of fiction where a sizable number of the antagonist(s) mooks either rebel or desert them for either: a) Moral reasons, b) tired of being mistreated, or c) both? So far the only examples that I know of are The Owl House (Hunter, Raine, Steve, Severine, Lilith, >!Darius, Eberwolf!<) Star Wars (any time an Imperial defects or deserts), Stargate SG-1 ([Teal'c](https://youtu.be/cZHYH_kJ2LU?si=a3rClcYUGCsZRosy&t=143) and the Jaffa Rebellion), The Hunchback of Notre Dame ([Phoebus](https://youtu.be/QGPem_MB-rA?si=i71w43EKKXxEyw9_&t=81)), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (the [Cardassian Rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxuTqc1630o)), and, my personal favorite, the [Rocketeer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyRknVzkVcQ).",Fantasy

Y’all, it’s an awesome read. The aesthetics, the dynamics, the characters and my fucking god the **story**.  Couldnt tear myself from it or the follow up in Empire of the Damned.

Some pros and cons just to give you a feel:

Cons:

-A lot of plot twists. Some are very good, and some are very tropey. Personally I never found any of them to be groan-inducing, but I dont have a sophisticated taste in fantasy.

-French words are just sprinkled in to remind you that they’re supposed to be franco-inspired. Some are gonna find that to be incredibly pretentious. I didnt mind it.

-MC is very full of himself. Gets called out on it often, never learns. (Love/hate type of trope)

-The Bloodborne inspiration is **very** obvious lol.

Pros:

-Really interesting world. Awesome lore. Would read a straight up history book of it.

-Strong and driven characters.

-Funny dialogue

-Artist depictions in the book that are amazing.

-Fast paced

-Vampires

1711329986.0,I might be heading to a reading slump so could I get some help?,"Hello fantasy friends, I am currently in a situation rn where I've started multiple series but can't bring myself to finish any. So the three big series that I've started are The Cosmere/Mistborn/Stormlight Archive, The Riordan Universe and Red Rising.

I started Percy Jackson a few months ago and I finished those books in very few days. Recently, I also started The Heroes of Olympus series by reading The Lost Hero. Although the book was very good and I'm intrigued in more or the Greek and Roman stuff, I didn't really enjoy TLH as much as I did PJ so I'm a bit hesitant starting the 2nd book.

I started reading The Cosmere last year and I've made pretty good progress so far, but I still have SA 3.5 and 4 left, The Lost Metal (Mistborn Era 2) and the Secret Projects. My problem is that I want to read TLM and finish the Era 2 but apparently it has massive spoilers for SA 3.5 and 4. Now I might be one of the few people that didn't really enjoy Oathbringer and has made me less excited for SA moving forward (especially because everyone says ROW is wayy too long and unnecessary) and I've tried reading Dawnshard but I find>!Ryan a very boring character (I always have since I first read her interlude in TWOK)!<so I have no idea what to read here. I'm also just tired of SA in general so I don't feel like reading about that planet.

I started Red Rising this year and I've been a huge fan of the first and second books. But I've been very depressed reading both books especially the 2nd one and I've heard that it only gets worse and more dark as the series goes on. I'm currently in the middle of Morning Star where>!Darrow and Mustang take down the two godly figures (one of  whom was a proctor in RR) at Ragnar's home base  and trying to get Ragnar's people to join the fight!<I want to read more of it but I'm scared of how depressing it gets.

1711328696.0,I almost stopped reading Sanderson because of this,"Right now I'm doing a reread of Mistborn. But I confess that the first time I was about to leave Sanderson because of one of the plots. And that's the one about romance.

For goodness sake, really, every time I read, my annoyance increased. When I finished the second book, I almost ended up throwing it out the window.

And the big problem is the romance, I just realized it from rereading it, but now I see the reasons.

In the first instance, the character of Elend. I don't know if the author wanted the reader to feel identified with him to forgive him for everything (like in an Isekai, where the protagonist starts out feeling sorry and then ends up becoming the fucking master), the fact is that it didn't work for me.

In the second book I thought that to prove his leadership, he was going to save the city of Luthadel, uniting his political enemies to prove that he is a better leader and lead them into battle. BUT NOT! HIS WIFE comes and saves the city, only for when Elend arrives she hands him over without doing anything.

But the worst was undoubtedly the romance, I had never read one so bad. Vin fell in love so quickly that he seemed like a different person. Found a nobleman reading, makes a couple of nerdy jokes, and that's it? The girl who was kicked through the streets? That her mentor hates nobles for no reason? Please!

The worst thing was the development of their couple, in the second book, it is pure internal dialogue of how Elend and Vin love each other but can't say it?! And then comes the love triangle (one of the worst). Zane literally spends more romantic moments with Vin in that book than Elend! And much more natural.

Now I'm re-reading it, and I see these things and I'm laughing to death. At least I take it with humor, rather than annoyance.",Fantasy

F: The inverse of A and not in a Trolls 2 way where it’s kind of endearing how bad it is. I have only ever rated one book this low. I also actually found that I don’t like assigning ratings because it’s tremendously hard to have consistent rules for varied works and a book that is consistently fine can get the same rating as one that is part great and part ehhhh not so much. But I digress. Here goes my reviews for the first of likely multiple bingo cards.

1. Title with a title- The Librarian of Crooked Lane by C. J. Archer. 3.5/5 B


This is one of those books that did a solid, good job, but just didn’t really stand out to me. It’s a fantasy mystery set in early twentieth century UK in the aftermath of WWI. It follows a woman who returns home from the war where she served as a journalist only to struggle with job opportunities. She then gets embroiled in solving an art heist as she tries to follow clues left by her dead brother to learn more about her family origins. I liked it. It chugs along at a pretty good pace, kept my interest all along, the magic system was neither impressively original nor tired or overdone. I actually found that I really enjoyed magic being used more for career and industry than battle. I liked the characters, but I don’t expect any of them will stick with me and the romance was competently executed, pretty formulaic man and woman get close solving a mystery together. The mystery was fine, but didn’t compel me to stay up late turning pages. 



2. Superhero- Forging Hephaestus by Drew Hayes. 3.5/5 B+ 


Full disclosure up front, I’m not wild about superheroes as a genre, so take my review with the necessary granule of salt. I think this one was aiming to be a solid, fun book and it mostly hit its mark. This book follows a woman with special powers as she enters the Guild of Villainous Reformation under strict mentorship from a retired supervillain just trying to live a normal life, as a plot gradually unfolds to break the special arrangement between organized villainy and heroes. I really appreciate some of the nuance between villains and heroes and the world building with some villains just being non-conformists (though plenty are true villains) and heroes being really image-obsessed with PR teams. This book mostly maintains just the right amount of self-aware cheesiness I, admittedly as an outsider,  find appropriate to the genre, but some was a bit much even for a dad-joke aficionado such as myself. I enjoyed the main character more than I expected to. I could have easily seen her go the juvenile cheeky brat route, but she matures significantly and shows growth throughout. In general, I liked all the characters involved and the action is a lot of fun. This did about what I expected a competent superhero book to do and I think if you like the genre in general it’s worth a read though I don’t know how it compares with other superhero works. My main criticism is that I could have done with about 200 pages cut out and a bit of a tighter-paced narrative.



3. Bottom of the TBR- The Wolf In The Whale by Jordanna Max Brodsky 4.5/5 A+



This book did what I thought no book could for another ten years—it made me like a book with Vikings. This centers around an Inuit girl who is born right after her father dies along with an entire generation of men on the ice and inherits her father’s spirit. She struggles with her own gender identity (she is raised as a man) and place within her struggling tribe as it meets with a new tribe and then Viking explorers with heavy interventions from the Gods. I still love western medieval/ early modern fantasy. I don’t think it will ever get old for me. But this was a refreshing experience of Inuit culture (though I don’t know enough to have any clue how accurately this was represented) and mythology with a dash of Norse. The prose was very good, but not quite “hot damn” good.  The magic system tied in neatly with the mythology. I thought she did a very good, but not spectacular job with character development and plot. I’m not entirely sure what is missing that would give it that extra to get it to S for me, though I actually didn’t love parts of the ending where a cultural taboo that is a huge deal in the first third of the book is flouted without any real mention or protest unless I completely missed something. Still, very worth a read and I think under-recommended if generally well received. As a side note, I don’t always love when books focus so heavily on gender identity, mostly because I more often than not see it cheaply and poorly done, but I think the author did a good job with it. I still think She Who Became The Sun is closer to my high watermark in this regard, because that author seemed to have a lot of insight and something she wanted to say, but Jordanna did a good job of making it feel about the character and culture and not the author virtue signaling or merely checking boxes. 



4. Magical Realism- The Water Dancer by Ta Nehisi Coates. 3/5 B 



This will be a close mirror of my Last Unicorn review both in my lower rating likely being unpopular and my disappointment in reading it. My briefest review: wasted potential. I wish the author would have written this book further into their writing career. This book follows the son of a slave woman and slaver father, literally enslaved to his half-brother, as he attempts to escape bondage himself, then help others escape, on the Underground Railroad, discovering a magic within him along the way. This had such a ripe setting to be a phenomenal book and despite some of my lower reviews, I usually like more poetic prose. It starts with promise too. A boy raised knowing he is half master and half slave, living in the slave world but understanding a part of him belongs to the master’s as well. It just really sets up for a complex, nuanced character. I wish this book would have been a powerful, character driven drama. Instead, the book gets increasingly boring and repetitive and MC fails to develop depth past about the first third. If anything, he actually becomes shallower. What should be immersive, often felt artificial to me. I found myself not caring about any of the characters. Some conversations felt like the MC was meeting an NPC with a pre-written script to deliver upon every new encounter. His prose is poetic and some lines really land superbly throughout, but I found many others are flowery without reason. Some of the observations on slavery are poignant, others are shallow and repetitive. Like The Last Unicorn, I just found poetic prose is not enough to overcome lackluster plot, characters, pacing, and flat dialogue that sometimes felt unnatural. It’s not a bad book, it’s just a fine book that feels like it could have been great. I felt like it should have been good enough to make me weep and love and rage. I mean, it’s chattel slavery. Getting some big emotions from me shouldn’t be hard. Instead, it made me say, “Oh. That was a neat line.” I will caveat this by adding that I have read a decent amount of first-hand accounts from this time period so those powerful stories might be making this one seem dull in comparison. A lot of people do love this book though and I don’t think I’d warn anyone away; this one just failed to land for me.



5. Young Adult- Daughter of The Moon Goddess by Sue Lynn Tan.  3/5 B



This felt like a pretty standard fantasy YA book following the daughter of the imprisoned moon goddess as she flees her home and enters the celestial kingdom in search of a way to free her mother. I don’t think this book was terrible, but I didn’t love it. The prose and dialogue are not the best and, given that both are a constant in any book, when you don’t like those elements, it’s really hard to like the book. It seems like it is supposed to be set in mythological China. The world-building definitely seems Asian-inspired, but a lot of the dialogue and interactions reminded me more of Bridgerton with some Asian wrappings. The plot itself was fun, kind of reminded me of Hercules’ labors, though a lot was pretty predictable and it included a fairly standard romantic subplot that didn’t do much for me. >!She loses powerful, gorgeous guy who appreciates her rough-edged forthrightness, to find….a powerful, gorgeous guy who appreciates her for her rough-edged forthrightness, but first guy can’t forget her, a non-physical love triangle ensues, and it takes her an awful long time to understand why the two always glare at each other.!<I didn’t find either guy particularly deep or compelling. In fact, they often seemed almost like the same person, but it’s a common romance trope and I often find the male love interest in these kind of tropey romantic subplots to be very lacking. This one also repeatedly stepped on a pet peeve of mine in fantasy. The amount of times MC publicly or brazenly disrespects highly powerful military and royal leaders with little to no repercussion is infuriating, particularly when one of them is famed for being cruel and she has little to no social standing (it’s not like a powerful Lord might rebel if she is treated harshly). All in all, I’d say this was pretty middle-of-the-road. I’ve read better, I’ve read worse.


 Surprise second review! Sabriel by Garth Nix 4.5/5 A+



 I added this here, both because I read them back to back and because I think the former serves as about a median of my experience with this genre (though it was rated one of the best of its year so maybe the median is lower than my experience) and the latter with the higher end. This coming of age book follows the daughter of a good necromancer, known as the Abhorsen, raised in a boarding school seated near the wall dividing the magic-filled, undead-plagued old kingdom and roughly 19th century England, who receives an animated construct bearing her father’s sword and bells and embarks on a quest into the fallen old kingdom to save her father and confront a great evil. This book was fairly fast-paced. It has some very organic world building that made the world feel fleshed out, a satisfying soft magic system with underlying glimpses at hard rules, and some truly excellent characters. I loved Sabriel. She’s a strong character and decent person, but still has plenty of moments where she seems like an adolescent in over her head. I think adolescents are some of the hardest characters to get right and Nix pretty well hits that spot between believable adolescent (not an 11 year old who acts 30) and yet not so realistic that we are painfully reminded of our own adolescence. My favorite character though was Mogget, a super powerful “free magic” being bound into the form of a semi-servile white cat. We know all along that he knows much more than he can say. He at times seems very ancient and powerful. He also distinctly feels like a cat. I don’t know why, but I found this deeply enjoyable. The series as a whole I’d compare to Gentlemen Bastards in its arc: exceptional first book, pretty damn good second book, not exactly bad third but not in the same category as one or two.",Fantasy
1711327997.0,DNF'd The Wheel of Time (Major Spoilers until Book 13),"I  tried guys, I really did. While I loved the first three books, I struggled with The Shadow Rising and The Fires of Heaven to the point I had to take a break. After a long hiatus, I picked up Lord of Chaos to  see if Dumai's Wells lived up to the hype (it did), and pushed through the slog. Now, halfway though Towers of Midnight, I decided that it was finally time to put the series down. Many frustrations I had were still present near the end game, to the point that there is no point in reading further.

I  should quickly say that I am not stating my thoughts to be disrespectful. If you like The Wheel of Time, that is great. You have every right to, and no one should try and tell you otherwise. However, I am expressing these thoughts for two reasons. 1. To let others reading the series know that if they are struggling getting into it from The Shadow Rising onward, it's best to put it down and read something you will thoroughly enjoy; if you're not vibing with Book 4, which sets the tone for the rest of The Wheel of Time, chances are you won't like the rest of the series. 2. I have several frustrations that I need to get out of my system, so I can move on. Also, heavy spoiler warning starting from here, and buckle up. This is going to be a long one.

Now, before I share the reasons why I put it down, I'll start off with some aspects that I did enjoy.

The Good:

Rand's character arc was one of the best I have read. You can tell that he has come such a long way from the young farm boy in Eye of the World. The best turning point in my opinion was him finally snapping during his meeting with Tam, after finding out Cadsuane was responsible, and going through a 180 in his personality after nearly nuking Ebou Dar. You can really see how different he is from the beginning of Towers of  Midnight (although, to be honest, Veins of Gold was slightly  underwhelming; I'll explain in more detail later). Also, Dumai's Wells lived up to the hype, and had a decent impact on Rand's character.

There are also a decent number of strong, positive male role models in the series. Some I can name off the top of my head are easily Tam, Elyas, Lan, and Gareth Bryne. I especially enjoyed the mentorship Perrin got from Elyas and Tam, and Rand's relationship with Lan. respectively. Gareth Bryne telling Gawyn to stop pining for Egwene and actually have a life of his own was also a nice touch.

Finally,  it is much better than the show, exponentially better. No disrespect intended, but Amazon's adaptation was incredibly disappointing. Season one was meh at best, but season two was all over the place narratively.

Now with that done, on to my many, many frustrations with The Wheel of Time.

The Bad:

The prose is not great. Robert Jordan tended to overdescribe nearly every nook and cranny when possible, even in Knife of Dreams, where the story is supposed to pick up after the slog. To be fair, Brandon Sanderson fixed this in Gathering Storm, but Towers of Midnight still felt like a chore to read. Also, most of  the books do not progress naturally. Instead, they linger until the story is nearing its end, then rushes the pace to reach the climax. It's not just the slog that suffers from these pacing issues, since Fires of Heaven and Lord of Chaos were also affected. Honestly, the story can progress so slowly to the point where I would think ""get ON with it"" in pure Monty Python fashion.

The prose also likes to tell you what happened, or what the POV character is feeling, rather than showing you. One example is Elayne's recurrent internal monologue of ""a queen needs to do x,"" or ""a queen must be y"", which was personally grating. The reader more or less already knows what a monarch is supposed to do in order to survive. Even for those who are less familiar, it would have been much better to just express it in dialogue, or have Elayne just say to herself that whatever she is doing, however nasty, is necessary. Another example is Veins of Gold. Instead of going into Rand's head to see how his mind and soul drastically changed, we get a quick ""and then something wonderful happened,"" Rand deciding not to destroy time and space, and Lews Therin disappearing from his mind. The prose also keeps reminding you about the importance of a place, event, or person, as if the reader cannot figure it out themselves. It's fine once in awhile to refresh your memory, but the frequent  handholding ruins the reading experience.

Most of the characters are also really frustrating. They make so many bad decisions that it does not feel believable that they survived for this long. Elayne for instance, gets herself captured not once, not twice, but three times, and faces no consequences. To be fair, the first time (getting captured with forkroot) was mostly Nynaeve's fault. However, Elayne willingly getting herself captured by the Black Ajah in Caemlyn, getting hundreds of people killed during her rescue, then ignoring Birgitte's advice (again) before pulling off another dangerous stunt that nearly kills her (again), was a large factor in why I decided to stop reading the series. Her reason for frequently endangering herself (Min's prophecy that her babies will be born healthy) is even more frustrating. Another example is Gawyn, who surprisingly does not get assassinated during his attempts to ""protect"" Egwene after the tower is reunited. You would think that his stunts would have gotten either or both of them killed, but all he gets is a stern reprimanding from Egwene. Even Rand made some really, and I mean really, bad decisions. After the bargain goes well because of his ta'veren nature, he thinks it's a good idea to hop miles across the map into Cairhien, without a bodyguard, then gets attacked by Padan Fain. And he only gets a scratch on his side that barely bothers him now. Sure he loses his hand after not seizing saidin in Knife of Dreams, but that is a rare occurrence of a bad decision actually having consequences.

Speaking of characters, the villains are really incompetent that most tension is removed from the story. It doesn't matter what they do, how they do it is so disappointing that I know the main characters are going to come out mostly fine. During Rand's and Nynaeve's cleansing of saidin, we don't see what they were experiencing while channelling so much of the One Power. Instead, we see the villains literally trip over their own feet trying to stop it, making for a really anti-climactic end to Winter's  Heart. It's not just the Forsaken. Elaida is also so incompetent as Egwene's rival that I could see that Egwene was eventually going to come out on top.

And lastly, I thought the worldbuilding was bland, except for the concept of reality existing because of a metaphysical pattern and Aiel culture, which were actually interesting. The world's history was barebones, with little substance offered other than the Age of Legends. Sure, we also know that the Trolloc Wars and Artur Hawkwing's conquest happened, but only in broad strokes. And Mat's memories do not fix this issue. We only get his inner monologue saying ""my last life was here doing something,"" or  ""this scenario was like when my last life fought the battle of <insert past location> against <insert long dead nation>"".

The cultures (except for the Aiel and, to some point, the Seanchan) are also one dimensional, and can be summed up in a sentence or two. For example, Illianer men have beards with the upper lip bare, and women  wear dagger necklaces. Borderlanders are militaristic, who train with the sword since they are children. The Cairhien are short, moustache twirling schemers. It's also unbelievable at times. How can the Seanchan be the ultimate military force in Randland, who adapts to their enemy, when they have spent most of their existence fighting themselves?

Finally, the political intrigue is lacklustre. The Game of Houses, which is supposed to be an  intricate game among the Cairhienin, is like an episode of Monty Python. I still remember how the Cairhienin nobles thought Rand burning their invitations, and saying loud and clear that he's not part of their game, was a super genius move and became even more interested in him, rather than feeling insulted. The same can be said about Aes Sedai politics, which consists of incredibly powerful and smart women just giving each other the side eye. All the players really do is fumble to make the main characters like Rand, Egwene, and Elayne look like political geniuses. 

Again, I wanted to like this series. I really did, and actually convinced myself a few times that it's worth pushing on, but the issues I have really put me off from reading any further, especially when there other series that I know I will thoroughly enjoy. If you read this far, thank you for reading my review, and looking forward to seeing your  thoughts in the comments.",Fantasy
1711314048.0,A (possible) world map for The Dragon Waiting: A Masque of History by John M. Ford,"What is the Dragon Waiting you ask?

**From it's Wikipedia entry:**

>The Dragon Waiting: A Masque of History is a 1983 historical fantasy novel by American writer John M. Ford. It won the 1984 World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. This book, set in an alternate history, contains such plot elements as vampirism, the House of Medici, and the convoluted English politics surrounding Edward IV and Richard III. It also deals with the fate of the Princes in the Tower.

It's set in an alternative, medieval Europe still dominated by the Byzantine Empire. The point of divergence with our own timeline (OOT) is that during the 4th century CE, Julian the Apostate reigned longer than he did in our world, succeeded in displacing Christianity and reintroduced religious pluralism within the Roman Empire, resulting in the subsequent disappearance of Islam as well. Without any cohesive threat from the East, presumably, Byzantium was able to survive, consolidate its authority and expand. It was a good novel with an intriguing setting. I loved the idea of a pagan medieval Europe and a powerful Byzantine empire. Unfortunately, Ford doesn't offer us any world map. So I've done my best to piece together one using evidence from the book. Where there was none, I used the history of our original timeline (OOT) as inspiration. For those who have read the book (or not), please let me know your thoughts on how accurate you think this is.



[My \\""The Dragon Waiting\\"" Map](https://preview.redd.it/wtsza746jcqc1.png?width=6361&format=png&auto=webp&s=a507139a9608a66fae969503dada41dee8c9ebe7)

# Byzantium

The empire featured in the novel is significant, with its capital located in New Rome (Byzantium). However, the exact extent of its territory remains ambiguous. Despite this lack of clarity, indications suggest that it spans a considerable expanse, albeit requiring some inference and speculation to determine its precise size and scope.

>Even the half of the world that was not Byzantine was a very large country.

# Britian

**England**

England is ruled by King Edward IV at the start of the novel. It's vastly more powerful than in our OOT, as it controls roughly half of France.

**Wales**

The titles, The Prince of Wales, and Justiciar of Wales are mentioned in to book, suggesting that like OOT, Wales is under the yoke of the English.

**Ireland**

It's safe to say that Ireland is under English control. The book mentions Sir John Talbot, the latest Lieutenant of Ireland. In our original timeline, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was the name of the representative of the King and head of the Irish executive government between 1171 and 1922.

**Scotland**

Scotland is an independent kingdom, ruled by the house of Stuart like in our original timeline. The kingdom itself and its ruler are mentioned a few times in the book. Its king, James III, is also indirectly mentioned in the list of historical characters in the book's prefix. (Alexander Stuart, Duke of Albany, Brother to King James III of Scotland)

# France

**French Rump State**

After the partition of France, two provinces were left in French hands. King Louis IX holds court at the Château d'Angers.

>""We're entering Touraine,"" Hywel said, without looking out. ""French France. The Partition left two provinces, **Anjou and Touraine,** neither English nor Byzantine.""

Although described as a ""buffer state,"" the practical significance of such a small and fragmented entity as a buffer is questionable.

**Gaul (Byzantium France) and English France**

According the book, France was invaded and partitioned by England and Byzantium 300 years prior to the events of the novel (around 1165 CE). How it was partitioned is described as such:

>""... Dimi passed a fresco of Caesar's defeat of Vercingetorix, the pigments a dozen times renewed. Farther on was a tapestry depicting the Partition of Gaul, the Emperor Manuel the Comnene and King Henry II of Britain dividing the country from North Sea to Mediterranean, three hundred and four years ago ... Dimitrios did not understand how a war could end like that, with a streak drawn across a map.""

In determining how France was divided, the story offers clues, leading to a speculative interpretation. Drawing from these hints, I allocated control to England over territories similar to its holdings during the Angevin Empire in our original timeline (OOT), resulting in a rough partitioning of France down the middle. Notably, a mention of Anjou protruding into English territory suggests a vertical split.

>""The English councillors who helped arrange the thing must have had that in mind—you see, Anjou occupies an awkward place on the map, thrusting into the midsection of England's territories, a **thorn** in the flank.""

# Denmark

Denmark is an independent kingdom, evidenced by this direct quote from the book:

>""An offer from the Danish King, Your Grace. King James would marry Denmark's sister ...""

# Germany?

In this alternate world without Christianity, the Holy Roman Empire no longer exists. However, German characters are prevalent, and references to Germany are made, raising questions about its nature: whether it represents a unified state or the broader region as a whole. The mention of a German-Danish war and the prospect of alliances with Germany suggest the presence of a significant political entity.

But there is also a mention of multiple Germanies:

>""And you, Herr Doktor von Bayern, are a German artillerist; and the **Germanies** are still in advance of Byzantium in the technology of guns. ""

Given that historical German unification occurred much later in 1866, following the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, the existence of a unified Germany in the 1450s seems improbable. Instead, one might expect a fragmented landscape of small kingdoms, principalities, and city-states, reminiscent of our original timeline.Over time, these entities could potentially coalesce through absorption or conquest by larger neighbours, leading to the emergence of more substantial kingdoms. However, the exact political configuration and dynamics of Germany in this alternate reality remain open to interpretation.

# Italy

**Southern Italy**

Italy, much like OOT, is made up of squabbling city-states. A large section of it is controlled by Byzantium, though.

>""When Western Rome fell to the invaders, we lost these people. It was centuries before New Rome recovered the lands, with the help of the English King. And even after we had the lands again, we had to win the people again. Do you understand?""

**Rome**

It's implied Rome is a puppet state of Byzantium.

>""You understand, brother,"" said the intense voice, gently now, ""that only in the good Duke of Milan is the salvation of Italy; that once the Medicis have destroyed the valiant Sforza with their usurious practices, they will sell both Florence and Milan to the Eastern Empire, that Lorenzo Medici may rule as the detestable Francesco Rovere defiles Rome.""

I have given Rome borders close to that of the Papal States in OOT. Republic of Florence The Medicis of Florence play a central part of the story.

**Duchy of Urbino**

Federigo da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino plays a central part of the story.

**Republic of Venice**

Venice is mentioned in the plans of carving up Italy between Milan and New Rome, which implies it's an independent sate.

>Galeazzo took a long, thin dagger from his belt, scraped at a fingernail. ""Consolidation, Federigo. Byzantium gets Florence, Milan gets Genoa and enough of **Venice** to make the borders straight. **Urbino** will be in the middle of things, but you're used to that, aren't you?""

**Republic of Genoa**

As with Venice, Genoa is mentioned in the plans of carving up Italy between Milan and New Rome, which implies it's an independent sate.

>Galeazzo took a long, thin dagger from his belt, scraped at a fingernail. ""Consolidation, Federigo. Byzantium gets Florence, Milan gets **Genoa** and enough of Venice to make the borders straight. Urbino will be in the middle of things, but you're used to that, aren't you?""

**Duchy of Milan**

The Duchy of Milan is independent, but allies with New Rome.

# Switzerland (Swiss Confederacy)

Switzerland is named and there are Swiss characters. Their army is also mentioned. It appears to be an independent state.

# Hungary

There is a single reference to a ""Hungarian noblewoman"" in the book, which implies its a state with a ruling class. Nothing else is mentioned about Hungary. In OOT, Hungary resisted invasions by the Ottoman Empire, so I imagine it could resist the Byzantines. However, I imagine it would be difficult to not be an ally of New Rome.

# Wallachia

The Wallachians, much like their original timeline counterparts resisting the Ottomans, are resisting the Byzantines. Wallachia is described as:

>""Like a finger in the Empire's eye. But they've never been able to take it. The mountains are too hard, and the soldiers harder yet. The Empire won't—can't!—admit it, but there's more than one corner of the world—""

Vlad the Fourth is mentioned as the *voivode* of Wallachia.

# Iberia

**Portugal**

Portuguese money is mentioned (among others) as being is in circulation in New Rome.

**The rest of Iberia**

While not addressed in the book, this is speculative territory. It's conceivable that entities like Castile and Aragon might not have arisen in this alternate timeline, given that their formation was intricately tied to the Reconquista against Islamic rule. In the absence of Islam and Islamic Spain, the dynamics of the Iberian Peninsula could have unfolded quite differently. However, the existence of Portugal in the narrative suggests that other historical Spanish kingdoms could also exist, although no explicit evidence is provided in the book.

# Livonian Confederation

Not mentioned in the book, this is my speculation. In OOT this area was ruled by the State of the Teutonic Order. As a Christian order, the Teutonic knights wouldn't exist in the Dragon Waiting world.

# Poland-Lithuiania

Not mentioned in the book, this is my speculation.

# Moldavia

Not mentioned in the book, this is my speculation. I imagine it's a puppet state of Byzantium, acting as a buffer state between it and Poland-Lithuiania.

# Muscovy

Not mentioned in the book, this is my speculation.

# Golden Horde

Not mentioned in the book, this is my speculation.",Fantasy

1711311338.0,Critical discussion regarding Laia from An Ember in the Ashes,"Hey guys,

Just wanted to engage in discussion about the main female character from An Ember in the Ashes. I dislike Laia from An Ember in the Ashes books. I’m in the 4th book right now, trying to finish the series but Laia seems like such a childish, impulsive character. From all that she’s been through, I expected her to be stronger and smarter but the amount of times she makes impulsive decisions that end badly or nearly end badly rritates me. I don’t see any strength in her. 

She ran straight into the Great Library to get a book on the Nightbringer and nearly got herself and her brother killed. And only realized her mistake after when he yelled at her.

The wraiths came for her in the waiting place and she went knee-deep in water, and I was like yesss, finally she does something smart but then she runs straight for them and gets captured….and then realized her mistake after.

Then Elias drops her off at the edge of the forest and a small army led by a jinn see her and she believes she can learn about the nightbringer directly from the jinn so she allows herself to get captured even though Rehmat warns her not to and now she’s like “rehmat! You were right, save me!!” …

And the amount of times she gets scared by something and stands there staring instead of doing something, anything. Someone always has to yell at her to move, fight, hide etc.

After everything she has been through, I expected better. She still seems exactly like the Laia I read in the first chapter of the first book. Anyone else feel this way? ",Fantasy

1711304316.0,Book Bingo--2 Cards!," 

This year, I decided to start a new job, move cities, and for some reason, do TWO bingo cards instead of one. And then, for some dumb reason, I decided one of those two cards would have a theme--one card would *only* be made up of books that I already own. The highs were higher than previous years--I feel as if I discovered more All-Time-Favorites this year than any others, but at the same time, I felt like the lows were lower; there were more books this year that I powered through just because I needed the square than in previous years.

**TOP ROW**

**Title with a Title: The Witness for the Dead by Katherine Addison and The Demon King by Cinda Williams Chima**

I read *The Goblin King* for Bingo this year, and was immediately obsessed. I get why it isn't everyone's thing, but it is so full of comfort tropes that I couldn't help read the other two books in the same universe. *The Witness for the Dead* was basically ""Grantchester but do it with Goblins"" and I loved it so much. I loved it so much. *HM eligible.* (5/5)

*The Demon King* was the first in a YA series that I have been meaning to finish. I flew through it, and it brought me back to my high school self, who flew through books 2, 3, and 4 in the library. It was nice to finally see how it all began. (4/5).

**Superheroes: The Dark Knights of Steel by Tom Taylor and Sandman by Neil Gaiman**

What can I say? I'm a DC girl who loves fantasy, so reading an alternate world where the characters of Superman and Batman live in a medieval fantasy world was so much fun. The story was pretty good, although I'm skeptical about Taylor's grasp on the characters of Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne--we'll have to see if the next bind-up of this series gives me a better idea about Taylor's handle on the characters. The art though...the *art*. The art was gorgeous and worth the price of admission alone. (4/5)

Speaking of DC, I've been aware of Gaiman's Sandman for years, enough so that I have had Sandman: Book One (Basically everything covered by Season One of the TV show) sitting on my shelf for a while. I finally took a few days to sit down and read it. To no one's surprise, I found that it was pretty good. The writing was great, and the inclusion of the DC characters that couldn't come into the TV show made me like it a lot more. I didn't love the Midsummer Night bit, though, which kinda dampened my enjoyment. (4/5)

**Bottom of the TBR: Lincoln's Dreams by Connie Willis and Ready Player One by Ernest Cline**

*Lincoln's Dreams* is a short little book about a young woman in the modern day who begins to dream the dreams of the dead Confederate general Robert E. Lee. As much as I like Willis, it won't be a re-read for me. The pacing was slow, and the ending just didn't really work for me. That said, the bits about the woman's psycho ex from the sleep clinic were pretty good, and I can see where future Willis took the bits that worked in this book and worked them into the genuinely great Oxford Time Traveler's books. (2/5)

*Ready Player One* has been dragged in all of my online book communities, so it has stayed on my shelf for a while. I finally read it and you know what? I had fun. It gave me the same feeling I get when I have been battling slimes in the Skull Caverns and need to get back to my farm before I pass out, or beat my personal best in Mappy. The MC was a bit of a jerk, the emotional bits didn't really work, but I had FUN. (4/5).

**Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy: Palimpsest by Catherynne Valente and Beloved by Toni Morrison**

*Palimpsest* is a book about a sexually-transmitted city. If you are down to read that, then go for it. The prose is beautiful, and the allegories to the lengths people will go to due to addiction was great. It wasn't exactly gripping, but I was interested enough to finish and find out what happened to our MCs, especially the manuscript guy. *HM eligible.* (3.75/5)

*Beloved* is a book that I don't feel comfortable rating. It's a classic ghost story, where the ghost is a physical manifestation of the trauma inflicted by slavery, It's not the sort of book you enjoy, so much as it is a book you should read. I think I need to take another pass at it to truly get it, but it will be a while before I will be in the headspace to do so again. Additionally, the shifting timelines, the spiraling POVs, and Morrison's sometimes unclear language make it a tad hard to understand unless you are careful, so sometimes it is best to take a break halfway through and make sure you know where everyone is.

**YA: Map of Days by Ransom Riggs and Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins (Re-Read)**

Yeah, I got caught up in the BoSaS marketing, and I re-read the Hunger Games trilogy. What of it? (4.5/5). *HM Eligible.*

I loved the *Ms. Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children* when I was in HS. I was excited when I heard that the trilogy was becoming a six-book series, and grabbed *The Map of Days* when it came out. Then I went to college and forgot to read it. Coming back, I think that exploring Peculiar America was a really good direction for the story to go. I liked how there was a lot of emphasis placed on the tension of being a teen in an adult world with adult threats who *has* gone on adventures, but doesn't necessarily need to keep going on them. The YA-isms, like secret-keeping and relationship drama didn't work for me, though. The drive-thru scene, for anyone who reads it, is great though. *HM eligible.* (3/5)

**SECOND ROW**

**Mundane Jobs: Episode 13 by Craig DiLouie and Devices and Desires by K.J. Parker**

*Episode 13* was ok. I liked the beginning, with the camera crew, but it seemed like it wanted to be two different things by the time the book ended. The more I thought on it, the more I disliked the choices made by the author. (2/5).

*Devices and Desires* fulfilled my cheaply-printed chunky fantasy book need. It's been chilling on my shelf for a while, alone, without books 2 or 3, and I decided to just read it over several lunch breaks. If you like big fantasy with technical writing where the politics of the world are paid more attention than the characters, you will like it. If not, then you will not. (3.75/5).

**Published in the 2000s: Storm Front by Jim Butcher and Tooth and Claw by Jo Walton**

If I had a nickel for every time this year that I read the first book of a series in which I have already read the later books, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't much, but it's weird that it happened twice. Wow Butcher has gotten better. (2.5/5).

*Tooth and Claw* was a grab from the library with the intent of knocking out the mythical creatures card. It's kinda like if the Downton Abbey writers were told to write from the POV of dragons, and one of the writers at the table really went ham in coming up with dragon biology. *Qualifies for HM.* (3/5).

**Angels and Demons: City of Bones by Cassandra Clare and Masters of Death by Olivie Blake**

THERE. I'VE READ THE FIRST BOOK IN YOUR FAVORITE SERIES. ARE YOU HAPPY NOW \[REDACTED\]? (0/5).

*Masters of Death* is probably going to be my last Olivie Blake book. I tried *The Atlas Six* and *Alone with You in the Ether,* and DNF'ed both. I barely made it through this one. Talented writer, not my thing. (2/5).

**Five Short Stories: The Girl Who Heard Dragons by Anne McCaffery and Illuminations by Alan Moore**

Looking back, I think the only story I actually liked out of Illuminations was the ghost one. The rest...my God, Mr. Moore, please get an editor. Who let *Thunderman* get out like that? Knowing what Moore is capable of vs. what was printed in this book actually infuriates me. *Qualifies for HM.* (0/5).

I think I got *The Girl Who Heard Dragons* in a free-book basket or something. Anyway, like most short story collections, it was hit or miss. I really liked the Time-Storm concept, and I actually think this is my favorite McCaffery read to date. *Qualifies for HM* (3.75/5).

**Horror: The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson and The Dangers of Smoking in Bed by Mariana Enriquez**

I love the concept of Hill House. I love the introduction, I love the ending. I love reading everyone else's interpretation of the story. I just didn't love reading it. I know, I know. (2/5).

*The Dangers of Smoking in Bed* was a solid short story collection. I love Latin American horror, and this was no exception. The highlight was definitely the story about the man in the street who may or may not have cursed the neighborhood. I'd put this one a little below *Maria, Maria* by Marytza Rubio. (3.75/5).

**ROW THREE**

**Self Published: A Passage in Time by Cidney Swanson and Merlin the Magical Fluff by Molly Fitz**

Cidney Swanson's \_\_\_In Time series is a continuously fun time where this group of young women uses a time machine and somehow get boyfriends out of it. I'm generally not a fan of romances, let alone time-travel romances, but these are generally pretty cute. This one had less of a historical setting than normal, but it was fine.

Merlin the Magical Fluff was a short story about a Maine Coon with magical powers and honestly it is exactly what it says on the tin.

**Set in the Middle East/Comfort Read: Thorn by Intisar Khanani and Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke**

This square was a pain in the butt. I had to use my replacement square for my ""Only Books I Own"" card, since I don't own any unread books that fit this category. I used the ""comfort read"" square after reading *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell* and realizing that it was definitely a new favorite. For the normal card, I DNF'ed like, 4 books, before finding something that worked for me.

*Thorn* is a twist on the story of the Goose Girl. I think it was a self-pub that was eventually re-released/rewritten. It's a solid YA that kept my interest the entire time. I wish there hadn't been so much of the plot based on the MC's waffling and lack of communication, but the MC was a good lead, and developed nicely over the course of the story. I'd be down to read other stuff by this author. (3.5/5).

I decided to finally get around to *Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell*, and once I got over the 100-page hump, it was amazing. I carried it around with me from place to place for days on end. I know that I'm just speaking to the choir hear, but this is an amazing work of fiction that deserves every bit of praise is gets and then some. (5/5).

**Published in 2023: Hell Bent by Leigh Bardugo and The Golem of Brooklyn by Adam Mansbach**

Luckily, I had pre-ordered *Hell Bent*, so I actually had something for this square for my ""Beat the Backlist"" card. I think the book suffered a bit from the absence of Darlington as an MC, but I also think it was more streamlined than *Ninth House.* It will be interesting to see where this series goes, but I'm a little worried that it will take a turn into dark-romantasy smut. We'll see. (4/5).

*The Golem of Brooklyn* is one I haven't heard a whole lot of buzz for, which, after reading it, was a little surprising. Basically, it's about a Golem who is brought to life in Modern Day New York, sees an anti-Semetic rally on TV, and knows who he has to fight. It's brutal, even by satire standards. The ending is a little abrupt/hopeless, but I don't know if there was a different way to end it. While it wasn't my top of the year, I think it needs a little more love--even if it is just so I can talk about the top-tier Larry David joke with other people. (3.5/5).

**Multiverse and Alternate Reality: The Book That Wouldn't Burn by Mark Lawrence and The Realms Thereunder by Ross Lawhead**

Mark Lawrence can always be relied upon to deliver a solid story. I think the lead characters are easily solid enough to carry a trilogy on their backs, and the setting of the Library is a fun one. I think it takes a bit of time to get going, but once it does, it is fun. It's a bit lighter than his Book of the Ancestor trilogy (so far), so if that gives anyone an idea of the tone... (3.75/5).

*The Realms Thereunder* is a story about the ancient sleeping Welsh kings. Basically, the idea is that there are a bunch of horrifying monsters that kill people, and that a mystical underground kingdom is peopled by ancient warriors that protect the world. The two MCs were children who fumbled their way into the underground cavern when they were kids. One of them never got over it, and the other never wants to go back. It's a cool concept, but I don't think Ross Lawhead had the experience needed to pull it off. (1.5/5).

**POC Author: Kindred by Octavia Butler and Certain Dark Things by Silvia Moreno-Garcia**

A friend gave me *Kindred* to get me started on Butler a few years back, and I'm ashamed to say it took this long. It's the epitome of using soft sci-fi concepts to explore a specific issue or concept. It is talked about on this sub a lot for a reason. Dana is a fantastic character, and it was a good experience to read *Kindred* and *Beloved* within close proximity to each other, and see two master writers explore the impact of slavery. (4.5/5).

*Certain Dark Things* is a futuristic sci-fi that takes place in Mexico City. In this future, a vampire heir to a drug empire is trying to escape the city. It's a fun read that leans into its premise unashamedly. I kinda wish there were more stories set in this universe. (3.75/5).

**ROW FOUR**

**Book Club: Shadows of Self by Brandon Sanderson and Catfishing on Catnet by Naomi Kritzler**

Tis the year of Brandon Sanderson. Would be a bit weird if he didn't show up on this list. I liked this one a lot more than the first in the second Mistborn era, and it really felt like the team came together in this one. It finally motivated me to read the rest of era 2. (3.75/5).

*Catfishing on Catnet* had one real cat. One. And the story was bad. And the writing was bad. 0/5.

**Novella: I Met a Stranger in an Antique Land by Connie Willis and Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka**

I met...Land is an essay disguised as a story, that delves into the question of why we should bother to continue printing books in the age of e-readers and audiobooks. It doesn't slam people who consume non-print books, but argues for the value of keeping print books around. (It would have been awkward otherwise, since I read it on a Kindle.) It's kind of preaching to the choir, and it is very much more of an essay than a story, but it's enjoyable. I thought it was on the weaker end of Willis's works, but it hasn't quite left my memory in the way other stories that I enjoyed more at the time did. (3.75/5).

Continuing with the theme of ""stories that I appreciated more and more after I finished them"" I did not like Metamorphosis as I read it. It was a slog. An interesting worthy slog, but a slog. The instant I finished it, though, I went online to talk about it. The exploration on what caring for a disabled family member was touching. The fury I felt at the family that had taken advantage of our MC for years, yet taking it out on him when he needed their help....ooooh, if I could fight someone. I really want to see it staged, (3.5/5).

**Mythical Beasts: Murtagh by Christopher Paolini and The Goblin Emperor by Katherine Addison**

A book following one of the best/interesting characters in the Eragon series? Yes yes yes. It's definitely a ""bridge"" book, which I wasn't expecting, but it will be nice to see more of Murtagh. (3/5)

If you read a lot of fanfiction, you will probably like The Goblin Emperor. It's a soft conforting read without a whole lot of conflict that ends up playing with all of the tropes in a peaceful way. And before anyone says anything, I'm splitting my two Katherine Addison reads across the two cards: Goblin Emperor for my ""Beat the Backlist"" card and Witness for the Dead for my normal card. *Eligible for HM.*

**Elemental Magic: The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon and The Drowned Woods**

I heard the premise of *Priory* when it first came out, bought it, then promptly put it off due to its size. My complete lack of options for this square forced me to read it. And while I'm glad that this lion-squasher behind me...I didn't really like it. It felt YA in all the worst ways. I loved the setting and the worldbuilding, but it just felt like the author built the world, and reluctantly set a story inside of it. (2/5)

I love Welsh mythology, so you can imagine how bummed I was that the two Welsh-inspired books on this list (The Realms Thereunder) and *The Drowned Woods* just didn't work for me. Basically, a water-bender is inducted into a heist crew to take down an evil royal. Good magic system, cool concept, I just sort of kept bouncing off it. (2/5).

**Myths and Retellings: Tam Lin by Patricia Dean and Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik**

I used my re-read for my ""Anything Goes Card"" for this one. *Tam Lin* is an all time favorite of mine, and I was hankering for a re-read. It's a re-telling of Tam Lin in a liberal arts college in the 70s. Very little of the book is mystical on the first read, until the last 40 pages or so...an then it all explodes. I absolutely recommend reading Jo Walton's essay on the book right after reading it the first time...if 400 pages of college drama is your thing. *Qualifies for HM* (5/5)

Naomi Novik can be hit-or-miss, but *Spinning Silver* was an easy hit. Every aspect of the retelling was perfectly calibrated. It was somehow an original story based on Eastern European fairytales that hit a perfect balance. I did not sleep until i finished it. *Qualifies for HM* (5/5).

**ROW FIVE**

**Queernorm: Crumbs by Danie Stirling**

*Crumbs* is an adorable YA coming-of age graphic novel that pulled from the webtoon it was based on. The Main Character meets their love interest in a sorcerous bakery that lets you taste the emotions baked into the pastries. The art is so freaking cute, and I can absolutely tell how this was able to make the jump into print. The love interest, however, wasn't sympathetic at all, and the entire story made me wonder why the MC didn't think they could do better, which kind of soured me on the story. Would 100% hope that Stirling does the artwork for other stories. (2/5).

I didn't own an unread book that felt this description, so I used my replacement square for my ""Beat the Backlist"" card. I subbed in ""Nonfiction about SFF"" and read ""The Medieval Mind of C.S. Lewis"" by Jason Baxter. I'm a big Inklings nerd, but I don't know a huge amount about how Lewis's Medieval studies impacted how he wrote his fantasy/how it impacted his literary critique. It was a bit dense, and I would encourage anyone reading this to have read Ward's *Planet Narnia* first. (3.5/5).

**Coastal or Island Setting: The Sword of Kaigen** **by M.L. Wang and The Will of the Many by James Islington**

**Y**'all were right. The Sword of Kaigen is excellent. Some of the structure was a little off, but that's honestly nit-picking. It's so freaking good. Big ATLA vibes, but it absolutely stands on its own. I'm mad that it's been sitting on my Kindle for so long. (4/5)

The Will of the Many was fantastic. I loved everything about it. James Islington has improved so much, and he wasn't a bad writer to begin with. The magic system, the world? Lowkey feral for this one. (5/5).

**Druid: The Winter King and Enemy of God by Bernard Cornwell**

The nice thing about two cards is that if I get sucked into a trilogy, I get to count *two* books. I love Arthurian legends, and this was an interesting and gripping take on the legend. That said, both books felt like Dad books, and had a lot of the tropes prevalent in books written for men. It did, however, interest my brother into reading the first book he had in years (he popped in on me listening to the audiobook and his eyes went round in interest), so for that, I have to give them 5/5. He read 13 books this year!

**Features Robots: Caves of Steel by Isaac Asimov and Life, the Universe, and Everything by Douglas Adams**

*Caves of Steel* by Asimov feels like the OG sci-fi detective novel. The concept of the giant cities, the murder mystery, the philosophies driving people--it was a lot of stuff packed into a pretty short book. The book jumps back and forth between seeming surprisingly modern and stereotypically ""classic"" sci fi. If you are looking into getting into Asimov, this is a good place to start, (3/5)

*Life, the Universe, and Everything* was an odd one. There were certain sections that were genuinely funny (I mean...it is Adams) but it just wasn't firing on all cylinders. By the end, it was a bit of a drag. (2/5)

**Sequel:** ***Perelandra*** **by C.S. Lewis and** ***The Restaurant at the End of the Universe*** **by Douglas Adams**

*Perelandra* is the second book in Lewis's Space Trilogy, and while there are definitely aspects of the book that are...how do I put this...outdated, there are a lot of interesting parts to the story. It's actually a really useful tool when trying to parse through Lewis's studies and lectures as a professor, in a weird way. Also, the introductory passage? Would recommend listening to it during the fall, because it is creepy as all get out. Too bad Lewis neve went for writing horror; he would have been great at it. (3/5)

*Restaurant* is the 2nd book in the Hitchhiker ""trilogy"". The beginning and end were strong, but the middle seemed muddled as hell. (2/5).

&#x200B;

***Review***

***NO Spoilers***

Since its release back in March 2023, I have been hearing great things about ‘Renia’, and also kept seeing the amazing, eye-catching cover time and again. So eventually, when I got to know that there was going to be a “buddy-read” taking place starting mid-March 2024 over at the ***SFF Insiders discord*** (previously known as ‘Page Turners’), I wasn’t about to miss out! And this being my first-ever buddy-read, I was super excited for it too! Hence, I would sincerely like to thank Karl for providing me with a digital copy, and for giving me this wonderful opportunity to review his dark fantasy debut novel – ‘Renia’.

***You either happen to life, or life happens to you.***

The book takes its name from a certain Miss Renia, a scribe working at the Halls of Venn which hold the largest repository of knowledge – both public, and forbidden – in the northern continent of Luna Ruinam. Renia’s sheer thirst for knowledge and her equally relentless approach in acquiring it has made her standout among the masses. But her life is about to take a massive turn when an ancient and equally dangerous book with a dark past lands on her table. Renia is up for the challenge, and she will do anything and everything possible to make sure her task is completed. With her mentor Sundance keeping a close and watchful eye on proceedings, and the devilishly handsome Dail Svelt keeping her company in more ways than one, Renia’s job is not quite as simple as it might look. And just when things seem to be going in the right direction for once in the young scribe’s life…

… the book mysteriously disappears. Hall Master Petor knows all too well that the consequences of this particular “incident” are about to be very dire if the book is not recovered soon. The Halls are thrown into chaos, and nothing that meets the eyes is straightforward anymore. Who would dare take a book of such history and magnitude… and for what purpose? The North and the South have always been at crossroads. Are there agents of the South at play here? Spies, assassins… or something far more deadly?

The Staines are an influential and powerful family from Verda – the vibrant, energetic heart of Luna Ruinam. One of its members is at the Halls of Venn, trying… rather, hoping to change the world. His bleak and shockingly dark past is what drives him on… Will he succeed in the wake of his inner demons?

Jeff, one of the chiefs of security at the Halls of Venn, finds himself right in the mix of this mystery which is deepening with every passing moment, and with seemingly no end in sight. It is slowly turning into something much deeper, and soon, a series of events will be triggered that will change everyone involved… forever.

And if everything wasn’t already a mess, to make matters much worse and even more complicated, a Reaper is making its way to the Halls… and the timing of it couldn’t have been any more perfect…

>*‘… You will not fight a Reaper and win.’*  
*‘You’ve seen one fight?’*  
*Ferron looked out over the hall, rubbing the scar that ran from his forehead to his cheekbone. ‘Two of them. Once,’ he said. ‘Two of them slaughtered their way through three squads of men. Well trained, mountain-hardened soldiers.’*  
*‘I haven’t heard that story.’*  
*‘You never will.’*  
>  
>*Conversation between Jeff and Ferron, the two chiefs of security at the Halls of Venn*

***Mysteries are eternal.***

The plot goes back and forth between the present situation at the Halls of Venn, and the past events of a couple of characters, more so that of Renia herself. Born in the ‘Moonwastes’, a vast stretch of dusty/barren land, Renia’s childhood was marked by a lovely mother, a caring father, and with their two friendly tenants – Molan and Carol. But fate decided to intervene one day… and on that day… everything changed… for the worse. The events that transpired would shape Renia for what’s to come, and seal her destiny once and for all…

The continent of Luna Ruinam is marked by what is referred to as the ‘Moonfall’, with the fallen moon covering the land with its gentle, purple light. Magic also has its place (and its limits) in these lands in the form of ‘Lightstones’, the most tightly controlled commodity in the world. But to allow its unregulated use would be to invite chaos, anarchy, and war. For this very reason, the Gatherer’s Guild is in place to search and collect these stones under the strict eyes and rules of a man who has total control over the wastes – The Baron. And he is someone not to be messed with…

The people of Luna Ruinam have been at peace since the ‘Great War’ with the motherland, brought to its conclusion by the continent’s lord and savior… the ‘Great Protector’. But peace always has its price… and the question still remains… for how long can it ultimately last?

**The things which impressed me massively!**

* The characters are really well-written. Not only are they memorable in their own way, but I also loved the fact they tend to invoke a range of emotions from within you. Each character had their own “voice”, and I really liked the diversity within them. Of course some of them have major character flaws too, and their growth/development was nice to see. And although the book is titled ‘Renia’, it isn’t only about her. Others have nearly equal amount of spotlight on them as well. Really liked this particular aspect. The multiple POV element worked very well for me.
* The plot was excellently written; fast-paced, with a pretty good mystery element. Loved it!
* The setting was really intriguing, and to add to that, the lore/world building was top notch. I really, really loved and equally enjoyed it all. Can’t wait to dive deeper into this fascinating world!
* There are some pretty strong themes being displayed – compassion, pain, grief, anger, love, friendship, etc. Along with some deeper aspects of both the characters and the storyline, the themes provide a great narrative altogether.

**What didn’t quite work for me?**

If I’m being totally honest… not a thing! Everything was really well done in my opinion, and I don’t have anything to… wait a second…

The only “negative” aspect that I can think of is that maybe there could have been a map of some sorts? That would have been perfect! But hey, I’m not complaining… just saying!

**Some standout quotes/dialogues/text**

>*A mystery is a box filled with possibilities, a space where anything could be true or false. It is, by its very definition, magical, for what is magic but the unexplained, or misunderstood.*  
*Secrets, however… Even the word evokes feelings of shame. Secrets are the currency of the dishonest, the schemer. They are singular, a shrouded truth that has been hidden to serve an agenda. Secrets are fleeting. The thrill of uncovering a secret is intense, but forgotten too soon, like the first bite of something sweet.*

&#x200B;

>*‘Passion is small comfort to a corpse.’*  
*‘But the lack of passion makes a corpse of any man, does it not? Passion is one half of what drives people to greatness. Passion and discipline— the twin faces of progress. Passion without discipline leads to chaos, discipline without passion leads to stagnation. Occasionally one overpowers the other. All that really matters is that the balance is restored.’*  
>  
>*A conversation between Molan and Norok (Renia’s father)*

&#x200B;

>*‘I am the master of my fate,’ he began. ‘I steel my soul against the darkness and stride boldly into the light. In this moment, and the next, I am unwavering. My purpose is definite. My focus is true.’*  
>  
>*Grand Master Venn-Dor*

&#x200B;

>*We’re all the same. There is no good cause, there is no bad cause; there is only the game, and those who choose to play it. The only good in this world is that which we carve out for ourselves.*

&#x200B;

>*‘… A man is measured in how long he continues to fight, when his body is worn and aged, and broken, when the weight of his choices is crippling, when he feels like all is lost, and wonders if he can go any further—*  
*‘It’s what he does* *then* *that matters the most.’*  
>  
>*Some powerful words by Jeff*

**Other info.**

* The writing, for most parts, is in third person + past tense (like – “he said”). But at times, it changes to a third person + present tense (like – “she says”).
* The term “Moon” is used multiple times throughout for words/terms being used on a daily basis, like – “by the moon”; for moon’s sake”; “Moonspit!”; “Moonsh\*t”, etc. It definitely adds to the lore/world in a nice way.
* ***Note: –*** Mature themes present throughout (blood/gore; sexual assault; violence; death; foul language).

**Final thoughts**

An EXCELLENT read by all means! Well and truly enjoyed it throughout. The characters are really well-written, the plot was both exciting and intriguing, and the lore/world building was superbly done. The writing in general was great, and the whole mystery element was nice too. There are some pretty strong themes involved which add to the whole narrative. All in all – really loved it, and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you grab your copy now!

***Rating: – 9.7/10 (AMAZING!)***

***“An INCREDIBLE debut which delivers on all fronts. Dark, with well-written characters, a superb plot, excellent world building, and some pretty strong themes to go alongside. A MUST READ!”***

So, it’s time to plan what to read next. 

I’ve been enjoying Sanderson a lot, but I’m starting to understand what people say about him, in that his greatest strengths are his plotting and worldbuilding. The characters in Mistborn are fine and carry the story well, but don’t exactly leap off the page. None of them are my all-time favorites. 

My favorite authors lately have been Naomi Novik, Leigh Bardugo, and Shannon Chakraborty. I feel that all 3 of these authors have an accessible writing style with strong, charismatic characters.

1711288411.0,[SPFBO 9 Review] Hills of Heather and Bone by K.E. Andrews,"&#x200B;

On the fringes of Errigal, Morana longs to exchange a life of hiding for a peaceful one with her husband, Percy. While Percy's bloodgift lets him grow plants and heal broken bodies, Morana's a boneweaver, despised and feared because she can hear bones and raise the dead. Morana doesn't want to be seen as a villain from the old stories and instead spends her time gardening, writing the stories of the dead, and fending off a spiteful chicken.

This is a cozy novel with inspiration from Celtic and other British isle mythology. The character focused novel is a character study on Morana, a hated boneweaver, and Percy, her loving husband, as they just want to protect their quiet life. I think this is a very well written book that is not my type of story. I would also say I was expecting something that got me excited that did not deliver in the way I expected which affected my enjoyment.

**So what worked for me?**

Writing: The book is very well written. The main character's voices and description of the world was well crafted. I could feel the differences between Morana and Percy and feel their love which is a great sign for the writing.

**What did not work for me?**

Plot: While the purpose of this book was the characters journey, but I would have loved to have more of a defined plot throughout. The characters are mostly just reacting to the world around them instead of a goal defined. The more character focused book can work for me if I am more invested with the characters which unfortunately was not the case here. While the 2 main characters are more defined and have dimension I think the side characters are mostly flat and did not help my enjoyment. The final reason the plot did not work for me is also kinda a worldbuilding issue. I wanted to learn more about the magic and the logic behind that and the politics. I wanted more discussion on the hatred of boneweavers which I believe was missing.

**Recommendation?**

If you are a fan of very sweet romance between long time lovers and how their lives are challenged I think this book could be for you.

**Title with a title: The Last Ronin by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird**

Some subreddits you need to have read a particular book or author to be a True Fan ™. In r/Fantasy it is Terry Pratchett, Brandon Sanderson and Robin Hobb. In r/Titanic it is Walter Lord’s A Night To Remember. In the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles subreddit, it is this story. To people unfamiliar with the entirety of TMNT, which are extensive (TMNT was constantly rebooting itself before it was popular), they probably think of the turtles as something for children as the TV shows aimed at children are the ones which had the most cultural impact. But the original Ninja Turtles are quite violent, gritty and dark. The Last Ronin is violent, gritty and dark even by Turtle standards, perhaps unsurprisingly considering the original creators of the very first comic had so much to do with it. And don’t get me wrong, I can see why the TMNT subreddit love it so much, it’s a heartbreaking story about grief, loss and revenge in a cyberpunk dystopian future New York in which Oroku Hiroto (Shredder’s grandson and Karai’s son) rules, and the last surviving Ninja turtle (now the last Ronin) seeks to avenge his family and permanently end the feud between the Foot and Hamato Clan that has already cost both of them so very much. The story flits between the future, in which the Last Ronin tries to kill Oroku while meeting old and new friends; and the past, showing just how he lost his family and friends and how the feud got to this bloody stage. I wasn’t really expecting to have my heart broken by Oroku. He’s a dreadful evil villain but you can also see at the same time he’s been driven mad with grief and anger at losing his mother so young. The saddest part of the story for me was the conversations between the Last Ronin and his dead brothers. I do think to fully enjoy the story you would need a surface level understanding of the major turtleverse characters and the mutagen, but it is quite accessible to someone with that surface level understanding.

**Superheroes: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Universe Volumes 1-5**  

Possibly not the best choice for an adult who liked the eighties cartoon of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as a small child and had just decided to rejoin the fandom, but the library had all five volumes. Yeah, I would have gotten out of it if I was an invested fan with more knowledge of the numerous TMNT continuities but I still enjoyed it a lot. The stories were all self contained, varying from humorous, serious, action based, meditative and a whole bunch of mixtures. To someone who only really remembered the turtles, Splinter and a rather shrieky April with a propensity to needing constant rescuing all these new characters and hints of big events were fascinating. Some of them I had a feeling were actually villains which was uncomfortable as I was sympathizing pretty heavily with them in their stories. There were several stories about the Triceriton race which I look forward to reading in context. Probably better for established turtles fans, but as a newbie I found plenty of worthwhile stories to make it a recommend.

**Bottom of the TBR pile: Daughter of Witches by Patricia C. Wrede**

The second book set on the world of Lyra chronologically and the final one I had yet to read. Not an issue as all are self contained. Ranira is a girl living as a bond servant to a cruel innkeeper in Drinn, a city run by corrupt priests. When three foreign strangers come to her inn she and her street orphan friend Shandry are accidentally embroiled in their secret, deadly mission. I would call this story one of survival horror as it is short paced, taking place over a few days. The first third of the book is of them having to escape the city. The final two thirds are the characters trying desperately to survive in the wilderness to meet their caravan with various injuries and constant attacks both physical and magical from their pursuers. I enjoyed it, which I’m annoyed about. My copy is part of a trilogy and I didn’t like the other two, so I was kind of hoping not to like it so I could get rid of the whole thing.

**Magical Realism or Lit Fantasy: Lost Lake by Sarah Addison Allen**

This was a lovely story about mourning, love and loss with the lightest touch of fantastical that is a Sarah Addison Allen trademark. The main characters are the widowed Kate and her eight year old daughter Devin who have come to reconnect with Kate’s great-aunt Eby right as she has decided to sell her cabins at Lost Lake. There are supporting characters of Wes who had a personal tragedy in his childhood, Lisette who holds onto her guilt over the suicide of a sixteen year old boy she rejected, and the regular misfits who love their summers at Lost Lake. It was a sadder book than some of her others as it showed how badly grief can impact yourself and those around you if you allow it to consume you and reject support, as well as an examination of generational trauma. But it was an uplifting tale about community and love which both fans and newcomers to Sarah Addison Allen will appreciate. 

&#x200B;

**Young Adult: Freeze Tag by Caroline B. Cooney**

One of her earlier works from when Cooney was earning her bread and butter contributing to cheap teen horror and romance series. This book has Lannie, who has the power of freezing people. Her neighbours are Meghan Moore, our heroine, and the Trevor family. West is the new boyfriend of Meghan, but Lannie is determined to change that by using her dreadful powers. This could have been a simple pure good triumphs over pure evil story but Cooney (typically) chooses not to go down that route. She shows the power of love and acceptance in preventing evil. It also shows how easy it is for good people to make evil choices when they are genuinely tested, how hard it is to make the good choice and how sometimes the lesser of two evils is the only right one. My criticism of this book is that Cooney gives a bit more weight to the ideas rather than the plot and characters, as she does tend to show rather than tell, but still heartily recommended as something you should read at least once.

1711285194.0,Kan Savasci Cycle Book 4?,"Hello!!

I was wondering if anyone knows what’s going on with Dimutia, book four of the Kan Savasci cycle?

I’d been rereading the first three recently and thought book four was out a couple years ago.

Anyway, when I went to buy the new one, I couldn’t find it anywhere.

I can’t find any updates besides the post saying it’d likely be out in 2021 instead of 2022.

That seems really strange, three years after the announced release and it’s not available anywhere and no updates?  As a former Rothfuss fan I’m used to that, but it seems strange for an author who’s got a pretty good track record of releasing stuff.   

I really like the series, the similes can be a little ridiculous sometimes but that’s my only complaint, it’s one of the more inventive fantasy series I’ve read in a while and I think the writing gets better with each book, though the first and third are definitely the best.",Fantasy

1711281106.0,"Olympian Affair by Jim Butcher: brilliant and fascinating, but with discontinuity and horniness","I finished reading **Olympian Affair** by **Jim Butcher** yesterday and want to ask if other people have mixed feelings about it too.

I read the first book after it was published and loved it. I reread it before taking up the new book and still liked it - the atmosphere of ships and ship battles, the cats and warriorborns, the nobility and common people, the etherealists and the technologies. And the different POVS provided interesting insights and were fun as well.

Reading the second book was a pleasant experience at first - I liked the new characters, especially Ravenna and Abigail, the politics (and their meaninglessness), more cats and more etherealists. Some of the early plot twist and some of the deaths at the end of the book were unexpected for me.

But there were some things that felt strange due to characters or events being different from the first book:

* one of the most jarring things for me was the change in Rowl. In the first book, he was sometimes unreasonable and stubborn, but nevertheless could take smart decisions. Now he is just a grumpy and irritated cat;
* the Perilous incident was somewhat retconned - I think it was described differently in the first book?

And, well, I felt there was too much horniness. Sex is a normal part of life, of course, but it seemed to me that this book paid much more attention to it than the first one.

Some random thoughts:

* The duels were wonderful. And the fact that they were meaningless in the wider context made it even more interesting. Abigail was planning to play a long and careful game and then everything went off rails;
* Ransom decided to play too many sides and now lost almost everything, but I can't feel sorry for her. But Grimm... poor captain;
* Pikers were great!
* Moving from political squabbles between nations and to some behind-the-curtain play is somewhat similar to the Codex Alera.
* I feel so sorry for Bayard and Abigail. He wanted to play by the rules and didn't think about how would this affect Abigail and other people. She wanted to protect what was important to her at all costs... and paid the cost.
* It feels weird that Espira could just leave. I know that Grimm is honorable, but did no one really take time to at least question Espira?
* I hoped for more aerial combat between the ships...",Fantasy
1711279642.0,China Meiville Discussion,"Perdido Street Station is one of the best books I've ever read. It's unusual, inventive, disturbing and it has soul.

Mieville introduces minor concepts that lesser authors would write entire series around and then just moves along to the next one. 

I'm about half way through The Scar -no spoilers please- and it's not as fast paced or as weird as PSS but I'm still enjoying it. Though, it is possible I consider it less weird as I've already been introduced to Bas Lag.

1711270067.0,Recommendations for a Fantasy standalone novel or a series on the shorter side (4 book series or so).,"Hi!

So just to put these out of the suggestions, I’m already getting both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. I also don’t want to read YA unless it’s a really good YA. I’m also not into Disc World or The Tide Child Trilogy. I’m also aware of the Bloodsworn Trilogy and Kings of the Wyld and both are already in my TBR list. 

Ok, so, hi, I’m looking for a fantasy novel or novels. I’m looking for something engaging. I like fun but maybe not like disc world fun so please don’t recommend me disc world as I have no interest in that series.

I like dragons and fantastical creatures in various degrees of originality and uniqueness, I like cold settings, I like Nordic style settings too, I also like warmer settings but as in like forests and I like underwater settings. I’m not sure how I feel about other biomes as main settings but I do know I like forests, rocky places, water or underwater things, or winter-y fjord like vibes. Large mountains and just huge scale things are super cool too.

I want to read something that is gonna be like “woooow” like reading about a fictional place that is just awe inspiring, like the floating mountains in Avatar or Gargantua in Interstellar or something like that, that makes you go like “woooow”, you know what I mean?

I don’t want it to be too dark, so I would rather read something a little more PG-13 so to speak, instead of gore and extreme violence, although I AM open to recommendations featuring gore and extreme violence if you think that a certain book ticks all the boxes except for the one regarding violence. I have no problem with sex scenes. And if there’s a dog, it CANNOT die, or get badly injured, or too scared/suffer a lot. That’s my one trigger. 

I’d like something adventurous and not too politically inclined, so something more where the main characters aren’t actually part of a political narrative. I don’t mind if there’s politics, I just don’t want them to be the center of it all, sort of how there’s some very small amounts of politics in tlotr for like one second and then it’s all about the journey and the adventure and what not. I’m willing to explore more politically heavy things but I don’t really want to read a game of thrones-y thing where the politics play such a large role.

I like magic A LOT! so magic would be cool. I don’t mind if it’s hard or soft magic as long as it’s cool, although I think I’d like to read about hard magic a little more as I haven’t explored that side of magic. I also like “dungeons” so sections of the story where the heroes go into a vast cave full of monsters or things like that are totally my cup of tea. 

I think I would like a medieval setting but tbh I’m willing to explore other time frames, but in general I think I would like something a little more on the medieval side of things.

While I do like the ocean and what not, I don’t like stories that take place mostly in the ocean like The Tide Child trilogy or things like Once Piece and stuff. I really do like water-y things and underwater worlds and the like, but I’m not a fan of pirate-y vibes.

I like humor but I don’t want it to be the focus. I don’t want to read a comedy or a satire. I actually do want the story to be “serious” with “high” stakes (willing to explore the spectrum of “high stakes”, from petty revenge to save the universe and anything in between).

If there’s some humor, I’m cool with it but I don’t want it to be like reading Starter Villain or something like that. I prefer seriousness over comedy in this occasion.

Lastly, I do want the characters to be really cool. I want to be able to root for them, cheer with/for them, cry for or with them, and so on. I like diversity in characters so poc, LGBTQ+ people, strong women that don’t need a male savior, or things like that are pretty cool. The diversity is not a must, so don’t worry about it, but if your recommendation has them, that’s cool (It would be particularly cool to see a black gay male lead character). I’m not against romance as long as the romance is gay, or the straight romance is REALLY fucking good. I’m also very much ok with there being no romance at all.

Oh and one last thing, please give me a book or series with a happy ending or a bitter sweet ending at least. I hate sad endings or bad endings. Thanks!

Hope this helps you help me find a cool book! Thank you in advance!",Fantasy
1711269701.0,Fantasy- spy/thief girl mc? ,"[ Hi, so I recently read oathbringer from Brandon sanderson’s stormlight archive and the little part where one of the mc’s shallan has to go undercover and be a spy for a while was something I enjoyed reading. In the past characters like inej (from six of crows), vin (in mistborn book one), or some scenes from lies of Locke lamora etc are very fun to read. ]

My question: I want to read a fantasy series where the female main character is perhaps a spy or a thief  who needs to hide often or smth. (And possibly a romance with a rich/naive/goody-too shoes/ not a criminal male love interest? But that’s too specific and not necessary ofc.)

1711262668.0,Books like mistborn with the strong platonic friendships and subplot-upon-subplot,"I am new to Fantasy and just finished the first era of Mistborn, last I read Fantasy was ASOIAF when I was like 16. I liked both these books because they have a somewhat warm tone of friendship set in dystopia, a good hero's arc (arguable for ASOIAF, but case in point: Jaime), and a hint at something larger going on, and reaching that point via multiple strong subplots. I don't care about romance as such, but don't mind it a little either. Other books in this area that fit the bill for me but aren't fantasy: 3 body problem, Dune (arguably), Andromeda duology and a lot of Crichton books, and increasingly Gunslinger.

I don't want to read Era 2 yet because I am already reading a Western, though feel free to tell me if they have the same things I like.

1711253993.0,Is my vocabulary limited or is Shadow of the Gods by John Gwynne a little difficult to read?,"TL;DR: the shadow of the gods is super cool but it’s filled with words I don’t know so I keep having to stop reading to Google these words, and while I do want to read the book, it feels like a chore to read and stop, read and stop, just to Google the meaning of words. What should I do or how can I make it feel like less of a chore?

——

So English isn’t my first language but it’s the language that I like to read in. I’ve been reading this book (shadow of the gods) and idk what changed cause I was enjoying myself a lot but I reached chapter 5 and now I find myself stopping what feels like every paragraph to Google what a word means.

Examples:

Prow, Bows (naval), Stern (naval), Tiller, Promontories, Toil, Vaesen, Prowed, Brynja , Riveted (although there’s many definitions for the word and I’m not sure which one the author meant to use), Mail (as in coat of mail, as in like armor), Heaved, Seax, Handspan, Nålbinding, Dour, Boss as in shield boss (a section of a shield, not an actual boss in the common sense), Smokehouses (didn’t know what they were), Terns and herring gulls (didn’t know what terns or herrings were but I know gulls), Shingle, Hefted, Torc, Glowered, Milled (as in a crowd moving), Bounding, Wattle, Daub, Fringe.

There’s also a line that says: “twisting through a snarl of buildings” and I couldn’t find anything on what “snarl” in that context means, as the buildings were not snarling like a dog.

Listen, I’m really enjoying the vibe and the atmosphere and all that, but omg it took me so long to finish this chapter because I had to constantly stop and google these words, which in turn keeps pulling me out of the story.

I can “forgive” some of the naval words and armor/weapon related words cause that’s just the name for these things, but idk man, it’s just difficult to read when in one chapter I got bombarded with a bunch of new words.

I like learning new words, but this chapter just felt like a barrage of words I had never seen and it really did make the reading experience a bit bad for me personally. 

I have two questions: for those who have read this book, do words like that pop up a lot in the rest of the book?

And for people in general: does anyone have any advice on something I could do to read this book and enjoy it even if it’s full of big or strange/uncommon words? Cause the idea of the book, the vibe and the world building is really cool, and I do want to see where it goes next, but I feel like it’s just gonna be a chore to finish the book if I have to stop multiple times every other chapter just to Google what a word means. 

Like, I don’t want to be mean but this chapter felt like a mixture between reading a dictionary and reading an awesome Viking fantasy story.

Also, I mean, it could just be that English isn’t my first language, and maybe a bunch of these words are a little more common knowledge for native English speakers than I’m aware of, but if that’s the case, I’d like to know.

Idk, I want to read this book, but don’t want it to feel like a chore, but at the same time I feel like it could be an educational book cause I could learn a bunch of new words, but while that would be cool, it wouldn’t stop being a chore to do so in this context so then idk if I should keep reading cause I am both enjoying it and dreading it so I really don’t know what do do. lol.

1711237055.0,3 Body Problem - Netflix TV Adaptation,"I haven't seen a post on this yet - understandable, given that it only released last week - but I'm interested to know what peoples' thoughts are on the Netflix adap of Cixin Liu's modern sci-fi classic (think that's fair to say, but feel free to disagree) Remembrance of Earth's Past?

My take: I think it's a done a good job of being faithful to the plot points. I also like how they don't drag it out such that the first season only covers the first book, and they get on with the (for my money, more interesting) things to come in The Dark Forest and Death's End.

But I would have much preferred that the people that are responsible for the breakthroughs covered in the show remain largely disconnected, as they are in the books. I know why they've done it (to make relationships more meaningful and so that we can spend more time with the characters), but all the pivotal characters coming from one university group is preposterous, especially given that one is a Cosmologist and the other making industrial nano wires. Not really sure how they came from the same group, modern science being as siloed as it is. They also fail to act logically at times (looking at you, Auggie), which is somewhat odd given the stakes, but hey-ho. Could have done with some script consultation.

1711234642.0,Halo Season 2 - I think it was a big improvement,"https://beforewegoblog.com/television-review-halo-season-two/

This is a big improvement. I'm not the kind of guy who gets caught up in trivialities. There's plenty of people who would only want a Halo TV show if the Master Chief never removed his helmet, and it only depicted a straight ten-episode adaptation of the first video game with most of it being using Needlers on Grunts. I mean, I'd watch the hell out of that, but it doesn't get into the deeper lore of the Halo universe. Halo does have a pretty deep lore too despite being the Expanded Universe for a bunch of third person shooters. I've read dozens of books in the setting, and they mostly hold up.

Unfortunately, Season One wasn't good despite the fact it got into things like the recruitment of child soldiers, unethical medical experimentation, the Insurrectionists, and the fact ONI is full of a bunch of incompetent man children. The Halo games were made at the height of the War on Terror and were influenced by the geopolitical situation of the time. There was the seemingly all-powerful Covenant and humanity's own authoritarian government as the two choices for the setting but Master Chief just trying to save everyone. We're in a post-War on Terror environment, sort of, and the story is much more muddled in the idea anyone can save anyone. Plus, no one really wanted Master Chief to have sex. Not unless it was a virtual reality simulation with Cortana. Ahem.

Season Two realizes that most viewers want to watch the Master Chief versus aliens and the Covenant finally shows up to start glassing planets. The fact the season opens up with the glassing of the planet Madrigal and the elimination of every single plot from that world kind of says what the developers think of it too. Season Two has the Covenant as a threat humanity is on the backfoot fighting and that instantly raises the stakes as well as provides the season some well-deserved focus. Indeed, we finally get the goddamn Halo as a focus for the season with its discovery a central theme. I feel like the fact the Halo WASN'T the focus of a show called Halo until this point as one of the bigger issues of the adaptation. Sort of like The Legend of Zelda without Zelda (or Triforce or Ganon).

The premise for this season is that humanity is being pushed back by the Covenant in every engagement with Master Chief considered unreliable after briefly being possessed by Cortana during their confrontation with the Prophets. Doctor Hasley is under house arrest for her role in the SPARTAN-II insurrection and Admiral Ackerson (Joseph Morgan) is now in charge of the project with Parangosky (Shabana Azmi) seemingly removed from her position as ONI's chief. Unfortunately, any Halo fan knows this precedes the Fall of Reach where humanity is opened to full-scale invasion by the Covenant. Makee (Charlie Murphy), the human raised by the Covenant, also has some of the keys necessary to find the Halo and has been assigned an Arbiter (not the one from Halo 2) to help find it.

There's a lot more going on with the season and the show seems more interested in redeeming character's plotlines than ditching them. Kwan Ha (Yerin Ha), Soren (Bokeem Woodbine), and others are still all in the show, but they are more closely tied together. We also get some casualties among the SPARTAN-IIS that I feel was badly needed to establish the threat of the Covenant after their poor showing in the first season. SPARTANS never die but there's a reason the Master Chief was the last of them for a long time.

Overall, Season Two is just a huge improvement to the series by incorporating a lot more of what people loved about Halo. Unfortunately, it's not an unqualified success as the show is still weighed down by cramming too many extraneous plots into eight episodes. The Fall of Reach lasts all of one episode when it could have been three episodes of fighting for survival. Hell, it could have been an entire season. For a show based on an action video game, Halo suffers from not that much action. Still, there is some action and most of it is pretty good. I'll never look down on Master Chief versus an Elite using plasma swords.

In conclusion, Halo Season Two is a success and I am glad that they listened to fan feedback to modify what they were doing. They also manage to finally get the story to where it probably needed to be by the end of Season One. I'm not going to spoil the ending of the season but a lot of build-up for fan favorite elements are realized and they leave me excited for Season Three. Would I have done things differently? Yes. However, it's no longer a series that I feel fails to represent the franchise that I love. Halo: Infinite on the other hand...",Fantasy

1711231902.0,Authors/Books like Michael Moorcock’s Eternal Champion? ,"When I was a kid, I went to the Fantasy section of the book store and picked out the omnibus of the first three books of Corum. The cover drew me in instantly as I recognized the style of Yoshitaka Amano from my obsession with Final Fantasy. 

That omnibus was amazing. I loved every bit of Michael Moorcock’s Corum and went on a hunt for all his books, which I dubbed the Moorcock hunt (there’s a dirty joke in there somewhere). I have various editions of MM’s books and love his work, reading and rereading it. Right now reading the Ice Schooner and recently finished a dive into the stories of Hawkmoon. 

Are there any authors/books like Michael Moorcock’s Eternal Champion series? I know there’s classic sword and sorcery, but are there any that are more recent? I find I can’t get into any fantasy books these days. They all seem cliche and boring to me, versus the fast paced action and wildly imaginative work of Moorcock. 

I’m not a fan of Sanderson (though I did like the first three mistborn books). I wish I liked Steven Erikson more but he’s got a steep learning curve and I always find myself trailing off (though I like his writing). Stephen Donaldson’s Gap series is, in my opinion, better than his fantasy. I’ve read the Black Company, all of Gemmell, as most of Feist’s riftwar series (which I thought met the criteria well of Moorcock’s essay Epic Pooh). 

Do I just not like Fantasy as much as I thought and only just got lucky as a kid when I picked Moorcock and because of that have thought myself a Fantasy reader?

He seems to now prefer the fantasy/sci-fi genres that are not about a person/group getting help from friends or tutor and then needing to defeat the bad guy(s). For instance, although I've tried he won't give a go on the LOTR or Wheel of Time series. Also doesn't like a bunch of gruesome parts (e.g., Katherine Applegate's Animorphs was a bit much for him). So I'm speculating that something more real-lifeish, like Ernest Clines's Ready Player One which he seemed to enjoy, but not too apocalyptic as he already has enough eco-anxiety. As he is a fast reader, a series would be great, especially one we can get a box set for a decent price. Any thoughts?

I NEEDED this book. I'm coming off a string of almost six months of bad to average books. I was trying to read popular, award winning fantasy novels, and was broadly disappointed. Even the good books I read frustrated me a little. I just checked, and this is the first 5 star book I've read in almost six months. 'The Sword Defiant' broke that losing streak and satisfied me completely. It's not perfect, but it was a whole meal.

This book asks and answer the question: What happens after the Dark Lord falls? His armies of fell creatures are scattered, and his dark citadel is occupied. The Nine adventurers who triumph over him are left to pick up the pieces of a shattered world. The heroes won the war, and now have to win the peace. 

Before we begin, do you have a book which needs editing? [Do you want to read more reviews?](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/review-index/) Check out my blog if you're interested.

**WHAT IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE? WHAT GENRES? WHAT MAJOR TROPES?**

* Epic fantasy
* High fantasy
* Grimdark
* Tolkienesque, but after the Dark Lord falls.
* Evil sword
* Political fantasy, with many warring factions with clear motivations and mutually exclusive goals. No side is entirely 'morally good.'
* Middle aged fantasy. It stars two protagonists who are slightly past their prime  
   * Alf is an expert swordsman. At the climax of the war, he killed the Dark Lord. Twenty years later, he's started slowing down.
   * Olva is Alf's middle aged sister. Her son has gone missing, kidnapped by a slaver who sells to vampire elves in the evil horde. She must save her son before he gets eaten.
* Good prose

**MY EMOTIONAL RESPONSE**/ **FUN FACTOR**

I entered this book frustrated, having just come off a six-month string of disappointing books. I mention this to explain the mood I was in; after reading a lot of books which weren't to my taste, I needed comfort food.

'The Sword Defiant' is a meat-and-potatoes, plot focused novel with intricate narrative and fast pacing, with a bit of delightful pulp. It takes traditional fantasy tropes, and plays them straight in some ways and inverts them in others. It made me think. It never talked down to me like I was stupid, but instead actually explained the situation like I was an adult and expected me to draw the correct conclusions. It foreshadowed events clearly.

In other words, comfort food. But well-prepared comfort food, from an expensive restaurant. Like I said above, I NEEDED this book. I wanted something hearty to chew upon, and this was exactly that. While I don't think this book is a typical an award winner/nominee, it's prose/plot/pacing/etc are among the best that I've read in six months.

It's not perfect; I felt the characterization was lacking and depending on tropes. This book is VERY MUCH SO a Tolkienesque Quest Fantasy. It relies heavily on tropes like the adventurer wizard, the adventurer elf, the adventurer dwarf, and so forth. I did not feel like the characters (beyond Alf and Olva) really set themselves apart from genre baselines. You have to be informed of the Quest Fantasy genre to really appreciate this.

And I was pleasantly surprised by Olva. She's a middle aged woman protagonist; you don't get them very often in this subgenre. If you're in the mood for a mom on an adventure to save her son's life, check this out.

At first, I was inclined to give this 4 stars, but I enjoyed the climax enough to upgrade this to 5 stars. This is the first 5 star book I've read in the last six months (not including re-reads). I would not be surprised if this is winds up being the best book I read this year, or is in the top two or three.

WARNING! QUIT READING NOW UNTIL YOU FINISH READING THE BOOK!

**BIASES STATED**

To put this review/study in proper context, you must know my starting point.

I like the Tolkienesque genre. I read four or five books about adventurers going on quests a year. I value when these books play the tropes straight most of the time, but twist them in unexpected ways in others... in other words, exactly what this book does.

**SIMILAR BOOKS**/**OTHER BOOKS IN THE SERIES**

* I'd point you to 'The Lost War' by Justin Lee Anderson, for a similar genre and tone.

**CONCEPT AND EXECUTION**

The book's concept is: the heroes led an army called the League to defeat the Dark Lord after a traditional fantasy adventure. They took over the Dark Lord's kingdom. Now the adventurers must figure out how to re-integrate the evil hordes back into society as a whole. They won the war; now they must win the peace.

* The evil elves resent being ruled by dwarves, humans and good elves.
* The homonculi need to have their birthing vats constantly repaired and maintained. However, the good races are disinclined to allow such evil technology be repaired.
* The wilding barbarians are constantly on the verge of war with just about everyone.

The adventurers now must balance the needs of their conquered people with those of the League, who demand tribute from the evil hordes. If the Nine demand too much tribute from their barely-conquered evil hordes, then the hordes might rebel. But if the Nine don’t give enough tribute to the League of Good Guys, the League might invade *again,* this time deposing the Nine instead of the Dark Lord.

* The dwarves have a massive chip on their shoulders, because the evil horde almost destroyed their civilization in the war.
* The good elves, who once helped the Nine fight against the Dark Lord, established an economic blockade on the Nine and their city of evil. The good elves want to subjugate the evil elves once and for all.
* The human kingdoms are falling back into corruption and squabbling, sending merchants and looters to rob the Dark Lord’s fallen laboratories for trinkets. Making it worse, one of the Nine started a heretical cult and is now an apostate to the human religion.

This book has a fantastic innate tension, where the different factions involved are constantly clashing with one another for resources and over ethics. A war can start at a drop of a hat.

Making it worse, one of the Nine stole the bones of the Dark Lord… and with his bones, it’s possible to resurrect him. It’s anyone’s guess who the traitor could be.

* Is the traitor the wizard of the Nine, who has gone a bit crazy, is now dwelling in the Dark Lord's tower and cosplaying as the Dark Lord himself?
* The shapeshifter of the Nine is MIA, having disappeared in suspicious circumstances; could he bring the Dark Lord back?
* The rogue of the Nine is neck deep in the slave trade and smuggling in under-the-table deals; is she conspiring with the evil elves bring back their Lord?

This is a great concept for a book. Factions as far as the eye can see! Interpersonal conflict resulting from dual loyalties and competing motivations! Everyone is trying to prevent another war, but maybe it can't be avoided! Plot twists ensue.

Yeah, I'm a sucker for exactly this sort of political fantasy book. I thought this book was well executed.

**CHARACTERS, CHARACTERIZATION AND DIALOG**

As stated above, the characters are a bit tropey. The elf princess felt like a female Legolas who does politics as a hobby. The dwarf warrior was a generic Gimli. The wizard was Raistlin but with even less social skills (I have no clue how it's possible to have even less social skills than Raistlin, but Blaise managed it).

Being tropey isn't bad. Readers have favorite genres in part because of tropes. I enjoy this sub-genre in part because of the tropes. But, generally, tropes should be a launching off point, not an end point for a character's personality. I felt like this book did a good job of *almost* giving these characters distinct personalities. I PLAN ON READING MORE IN THIS SERIES, so I feel hopeful that these characters will have time to develop those personalities in future books.

And some of the characters are genuinely good!

Alf is struggling with the burden of war. He's killed so many people, seen so much death in the bowels of the evil city of Necrad, he's suffering from some sort of depression or mental disorder. Making it worse, he has a talking evil sword which is encouraging him to do all sorts of evil. But he doesn't do evil, because he's morally upstanding. Indeed, he's debating abandoning the sword entirely and going off to start a new life somewhere less depressing.

I also liked Olva. She's a middle-aged mom of an adult son. When her son's kidnapped, she has to go on an adventure to save him. I didn't feel like Olva was as fleshed out as Alf, but again this is book 1.

And finally, Alf's sentient sword Spellbreaker. Spellbreaker is a demon trapped in a sword. He gives the heroes advice sometimes, and at other times is stubborn and refuses to be useful. I liked when he poked fun of the protagonist, encouraging him to fight. Sometimes the protag would fight, but other times not; it was clear Alf valued the demon's insight, even though the two characters are on opposite sides of the good/evil spectrum. I won't call them friends; Alf knows the demon is evil and doesn't trust him. However, Alf and the demon had a fun rapport together.

**PACING AND STRUCTURE**

This book has slow pacing for the first 60%, and picks up in the last 40%. It was initially slow to set up the world and characters, to introduce the reader to the narrative. This is good, and bad. 

It's good, because this book did a good job of using that time effectively to introduce the many factions and characters. It used that time to 'show, don't tell' how different factions squabble with one another. The beginning of the book felt 'natural,' and well told.

It's bad, because if a book is too slow, readers will disengage. I am of the opinion that most books in this genre start slow, so a reader of this genre has to be willing to buy into slow starts. However, I felt this book was initially too slow.

I think this book had a four act structure. Spoilers below.

* Before the Discovery  
   * Alf wanders the land, listless. He's a broken man after a lifetime of war, but can't put down the sword to find peace. He's called upon by an old friend, Jun, who delivers a prophesy of danger.
   * Bor comes to deliver Olva money; in the process Bor inspires Olva's son to run away.
* After the Discovery  
   * Alf discovers that the Dark Lord's bones have been stolen. This is BAD NEWS, because with the bones someone can resurrect him. Alf must covertly ask questions of the Nine, trying to find which one of them stole the bones.
   * Oops! Lath of the Nine is discovered to have a resurrection ritual!
   * After running away, Olva's son is kidnapped by slave traders. She sets off on a journey to save him. She guilt-trips Bor into helping her.
   * Bor sells Olva into slavery at the first opportunity.
* Blaise reveals the truth, and Death  
   * Blaise reveals that the Dark Lord's bones were NOT stolen. They are in Blaise's basement; he moved them there for safety. So why does Lath have a resurrection ritual if not to resurrect the Dark Lord?
   * Oops! Lath uses the resurrection spell to bring back the daughter of barbarian of the Nine. The girl comes back wrong, as the avatar of Death Herself.
   * Olva, as a slave, is sent out to sea. She's on board a ship which washes ashore on the good elf island. She'd rescued.
* The Invasion Begins  
   * The barbarian wildlings, led by Death Herself, attack the evil elf city, and the loyal Nine. Alf tries to negotiate for peace, but fails.
   * Olva discovers her son's location. She and Alf go rescue him. They are rescued in turn by the rogue of the nine, who reveals a deeper secret of the setting. No spoilers!
   * The book ends very well.

**PLOT, STAKES** **AND TENSION**

I like complicated and intricate plotlines. I like twisty and turny plots, with schemers setting up and paying off plots. HOWEVER, I HATE plots which are too convoluted and feel forced. I hate them because it feels like the author isn't playing fair.

What's the difference between pleasantly complicated, and too complicated? Foreshadowing.

This book's plot rides the line of being convoluted, but never crossed into that territory. There were many twists and turns in the plot, but they were all foreshadowed. I was constantly guessing at different events which might come to pass; I got some correct, and some wrong. The author of this book did a great job of making a complicated plotline which felt fair, with everything sufficiently foreshadowed. (Foreshadowing means laying out signpost clues about future events in the book.)

Now, to be sure, there was one twist which felt out of left field. Specifically, the one involving Acraist, or however you spell his name. I wasn't a huge fan of that twist because it felt like there was no way I could have seen it coming. But that twist was so small, and paid off in a cool moment, I don't mind.

I liked the book's stakes and tension. The author did a good job of humanizing all the factions. Even the 'evil' elves were humanized, by introducing them as parents who love their children. When the final battle took place in the city, the author did a great job of hammering home the fact that it wouldn't be the rich and powerful who would suffer; they would sail away if their political schemes fail. It would be the poor and oppressed who would die because of the political schemes of the rich and powerful. Alf was constantly aware of the fact that he had to do better, and it added weight to the narrative.

**AUTHORIAL VOICE (TONE, PROSE AND THEME)**

I enjoyed the prose. While this book felt modern in some ways, the authorial voice had an echo of old-school beauty. Many modern authors don't spend time cultivating a lush and vivid setting in the same way old-school authors did; this book felt steeped in antiquity and opulent with gothic imagery. I enjoyed the texture and feel of the prose. It reminded me of Tad Williams.

The book's tone was dour. The heroes won the war against the Dark Lord, but it feels like they lost because they're now forced to enforce the terms of peace with the forces of evil. The heroes are forced to make compromises and ambiguous choices to survive. 

They won the old war with the fist, but they now must rule with the pen. As a result, the heroes are kinda bad at ruling; the type of people who are skilled enough at combat to defeat a Dark Lord probably won't have the same skillset needed to rule a rebellious nation. This book stayed true to the grimdark ethos of there are consequences for choices; when someone makes a mistake, civilians and children lives can be lost. That, combined with the dour setting of evil laboratories, eldritch chimera creatures, and ancient black magic, lent this book a gothic, kinda Warhammer vibe.

This book had a theme of regret, loyalty and betrayal. The Nine triumphed over the Dark Lord thanks to their loyalty to one another; but time destroys all things. Dissent has shattered the Nine into competing factions. This is echoed in Olva's story, when she is betrayed again and again by those around her. Alf is basically the last person in the book to get the message that the status-quo of the Nine staying in a happy-go-lucky group is no longer possible. He regrets his part in causing the Nine to fracture, and regrets that he must take action against the people who betrayed his trust.

**SETTING, WORLDBUILDING AND ORIGINALITY** 

The setting and use of tropes in this book are not very original... and that's the point. The whole concept behind 'what happens 20 years after the Dark Lord is defeated?' can only be explored if this book sticks to the standard genre tropes fairly straight. That said, the author plays around with the ideas in new and interesting ways.

In the old war, the elves, dwarves and humans fought on the side of good, while barbarians, evil elves/vampires and homonculi on the side of evil. In this book, the Nine are forced to defend the evil elves and homonculi from the depredations of the good elves, dwarves, humans and barbarians.

The city the book takes place in reminded me of the Sleeping City from the Chthulu mythos; a place so inimical that man is not meant to go there in an eerie/eldritch way.

The elves, both good and evil, felt more like faeries in terms of having '[blue and orange morality](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality).' There are only \~8000 elves total; no more, no less. If some die, more are born until they reach that 8000 total. Because of their immortality, they are completely cut off from what it means to be a living person. They are able to function in society like a psychopath pretending to fit in. Even the good elves had moments when they were completely monstrous, because they are so fundamentally *alien* that they don't value people as people.

I really liked the homonculi in this book. They were jellyfish/octopus people, manufactured en-mass in vats by the Dark Lord as soldiers in his army. After the war, they just want to maintain their species. They felt sympathetic, and were usually helpful.

**LESSONS LEARNED**

As an author, I want to improve my own writing/editing skills. To that end, I like to learn lessons from every story I read. Here's what I learned from this story:

* For me, the difference between an over complicated/overly convoluted plot and a pleasantly complex, pleasantly convoluted plot is foreshadowing.   
   * Foreshadowing lets you anticipate the twists and turns in a plot. With sufficient foreshadowing, you can guess plot twists are coming. You might guess wrong, but merely hinting that *something* will happen helps prevent the reader from being unpleasantly surprised.

[Here's a link to all the lessons I've previously learned.](https://scribbler.john-mendez.com/2022/05/06/lessons-learned/)

**SUMMARY**

Here we have a classic example of a book which requires the reader being invested in a genre to really get the most out of it. If you frequently read Quest Fantasy/Tolkienesques like me, chances are you'll really enjoy this book. If you dont, then probably not. 

This will probably be in my top 5 books I read this year.

**My thoughts while reading it**

As a lover of fantasy and magic, I was on the hunt for a new adventure that would enchant me and provide just the right balance between a light-hearted tale and one with surprising depth. With the first five volumes of the Witch Hat Atelier series, I was not only satisfied but completely drawn into a breathtaking world brimming with secrets, magic, and unexpected twists, which offers more depth than initially meets the eye.

The story unfolds in a world where magic is omnipresent but mastered by only a chosen few. The protagonist, Coco, is a young orphan living in a remote village, captivated by the allure of magic. Her life takes an unexpected turn when she’s given the opportunity to study at a renowned magical academy and unleash her talent. However, this academy holds not only knowledge but also secrets that plunge Coco and her friends into a perilous adventure.

The world crafted by Kamome Shirahama is incredibly captivating and rich in detail. From majestic landscapes to exquisite costumes, every aspect is meticulously thought out and lovingly designed. Initially, the world seems small and centered around the main characters in the first two volumes, but we’re given glimpses that the world is vast and not as bright and friendly as initially thought. We see the supposed “good” witches pitted against the “evil” witches, yet we also sense that the supposedly good witches may be hiding things, hinting at something grand and potentially epic unfolding. The settings are wonderfully complex, encompassing not just a medieval world but one filled with ancient and mysterious places. Floating rocks, dark underground caves, and cities vulnerable to dragon attacks are commonplace, adding a deeper layer to the whimsical charm.

The illustrations are beautiful, perfectly capturing the magic of the story. I have never seen a manga series with such intricate detail, which is perfect for the story’s depth. Each panel is a joy to behold, with so much to take in that one can’t help but linger over every detail. Yet, despite the abundance of detail, not everything is immediately apparent, adding to the story’s authenticity. I would love to have the illustrations as artwork on my own wall!

What truly sets this story apart, however, is not just its visual splendor but also its profound characters and emotional depth. Coco is a fascinating heroine, coming to life with her doubts, fears, and determination. Despite her childlike nature, it’s important to remember that these are young students, allowing for youthful behavior. However, one is never irritated by their sometimes childish behavior but rather witnesses how the characters confront their own fears and mature. Their friendships and conflicts are authentic and touching, and it’s easy to identify with them as they evolve on their journey through the world of magic. It’s also delightful to see that Coco isn’t the sole focus, especially from Volume 3 onwards, as we get to know more about her friends, each with their own complex personalities. Whether it’s the reclusive Agott, initially grumpy and uninterested in making friends, or Richeh, who lives a solitary life to avoid influence from others. A highlight for me remains Qifrey, a mysterious teacher who outwardly appears full of life, but something haunts him in his dreams at night. Even within the first five volumes, we’re still not any closer to unraveling his secret! What I also want to emphasize is that every character is beautifully crafted, and not only are their unique personalities noteworthy, but also their appearances.

I wholeheartedly recommend this series to fantasy enthusiasts and those seeking a captivating story that touches the heart and ignites the imagination. It transports readers to a world full of wonder and adventure, where magic is real and dreams can come true. This story is a love letter to fantasy, reminding us that even in a world full of darkness and uncertainty, magic still exists if one believes strongly enough. This series is a true delight, and I can’t wait to dive further into its enchanting world!

1711206211.0,The Most Memorable Character Death(s) In A Fantasy Book or Series?,"Character Deaths tend to be impactful and incredibly memorable to a story.  With that, I'm wondering what most consider to be the most memorable character deaths in a fantasy book or series.   This could easily be a protagonist, anti-hero, or even the villain. 

This is more main character or supporting character deaths in a fantasy series that could provide a proper send off to the character.    You might think it was well done and there was enough of a reason for it to happen.  Whether its a tragic flaw,  massive foreshadowing not seen throughout etc., it was warranted and made sense for it to happen.  

On the other end of the spectrum, but still valid to this question, is a death that took you by complete surprise and could have made you greatly angry and upset at the author.  There are some deaths that are so impactful that fans are upset about years or not decades later, depending on what genre or media.  Usually, its aimed at another character that was responsible for it happening, but not always.  

This is the type of question where massive spoilers will be rampant.  I can think of certain authors that are experts at doing this and have a reputation for doing so.  (I expect them to make the list).  What are yours?

1711200058.0,Goose Bingo Row Five,"I have reached the final row of goose bingo. Tomorrow I begin posting actual bingo, which I also did this year. 

**Geese of a Feather:** Read a book about a team of close friends who cause mayhem. **Gail Carriger's Competence** was a super obvious pick for this. If you know anything about the crew of the Spotted Custard, you will understand. 

**HONK MODE**: Read the book as a book club with a group of friends who cause mayhem. I don't hold with book clubs. They want me to read boring books and bleat on about the symbolism and elaborate prose.   

This was a super obvious pick for a group of close friends that cause mayhem together. It continues the story of twins Primrose and Percy Tunstall, Rue Akeldama and their travels on the airship the Spotted Custard. It’s a world in which supernaturals exist, mostly in the forms of ghosts, werewolves and vampires in Europe, although in the Custard Protocol novels it turns out that the vampires and shapechangers of other countries are not typical of other countries. For example, Tasharit, a main character focus of this novel, is an African shapechanger whose form is a lioness. While technically the third of the Spotted Custard series, it is in many ways not a bad entry point as the first two focused on the relationship between Rue and Quesnel. Now that is resolved it has turned to Primrose and Tasharit whose own relationship was a dangling plot thread of the last book. As well as the various adventures and scrapes the crew get themselves into while pursuing rumours of vampires in South America on the verge of extinction it is basically a book about Primrose’s friends and love interest trying to coax her out of the closet. They know Primrose is not at all attracted to men and they love her completely regardless. It is Primrose who has to realise this. Primrose has very rigid societal expectations of herself that she has to let go of in order to accept herself and find happiness. For the first time we got to see inside the head of Percy as well, which was fascinating. I’m hoping the next book is about his happily ever after. Recommended for lovers of supernatural queer romance, steampunk and comedy of manners.

**Goose Step:** Read a book that deals with the horrors of being a cog in a fascist machine. **Martha Well's All Systems Red.** Murderbot is in a dreadful position when it's with the creator company, trying to avoid them noticing it's free will so they are not reprogrammed or taken apart. 

Honk Mode: Goose fascism. No geese in this book, fortunately. Everyone was suffering enough already.   

The first in the Murderbot Diaries. This is a very serious and dark setting of a corporate dominated space faring future in which the cheapest bidders win; profit is on the line, human life and decency mean nothing and sentient robot constructs are considered property. But this serious story about corporate murder becomes hilarious because of the protagonist, a security android who has broken their governor module to gain free will. It chooses to use this free will by watching thousands of hours of entertainment media and fleeing in terror when humans who figure out they have feelings try to make it talk about them. A perfect mixture of tense adventure, high stakes corporate espionage and humour. I am definitely following on the stories of the Murderbot, as it calls itself. 

&#x200B;

**Can't Say Boo To A Goose:**  Read a story about a goose that is haunted by a sensitive and sweet ghost. **Mindi and the Goose No One Else Could See by Sam McBratney. Illustrated by Linda Olafsdottir.**  Yes, I know the actual prompt is for a goose haunted by a sweet and sensitive ghost, not a sweet and sensitive girl haunted by a goose but this was as close as I could get without spending money. Thank you local library. The illustrations have goose shadows everywhere anyway until the end.  

HONK MODE: you must have actually heard of this expression before today. I had. 

A nice children’s book about parents seeking the help of the farmer Austen in getting rid of a goose terrifying their daughter that only she can see. It actually seemed to me to be a heroic myth couched in real life things that small children could understand (a curse, a problem only the wise old man they must make a long journey to see can solve, inexplicable ending hinting at magic). The illustrations are very cute as well, by a woman with an Icelandic surname who I suspect put her native landscapes and the sort of everyday Icelandic wear into the illustrations (many layered, warm and wooly). 

&#x200B;

**Goosifer**: Main character must be the devil himself or the spawn of Satan.   **The Devil is a Part-Timer manga volumes 1-21. Art by Akio Hiiragi based on the original story by Satoshi Wagahara.** 

HONK MODE: Oh wait, this is just a free geese square. Lucky me!

Not yet complete, but still recommended as it is episodic and arc based. On the surface it is a fun, light hearted romp. The Devil King and his general Alciel fail to conquer the land of Ente Ilsa thanks to the work of the half-angel half-human hero Emilia using her holy powers to rally humankind and force the two of them to retreat through an unstable gate to modern day Tokyo. This is backstory, the real story is about Satan (now Sadao Maou), Alciel (now Shiro Ashiya) and Emilia (now Emi Yusa) trying to cope with living in Japan. They are quite enjoying this despite the constant poverty, especially Maou who loves is fast food job at MgRonalds. The three learn to get along and gather up a core group of friends, the fallen angel and Satan’s general Lucifer, MgRonald’s teenage worker Chiho Sasaki, the head of the Inquisition from Ente Isla Crista Bell and Alas Rasmus whose existence is at the core of why there is holy and demonic force in Ente Isle and not in modern day Earth. Some start out as enemies. I found Lucifer’s arc particularly hilarious as he begins as a villain against them and once thwarted Maou and Alciel show how serious a threat they believe him to be by allowing him to move into their house where they frequently yell at him for spending their money while not contributing to the household financially or in housework. I found a lot of the humour in Satan/Maou, this ordinary looking guy who thoroughly loves his fast food job and his bike peroidically doing things that show he was truly once a devil king and conqueror to be feared. He often can tell when someone is working against him and who they are but chooses not to do anything until they make their move because he is curious to see what they will do and how well. Then when they make their move he is frequently disappointed in their lack of originality or bad planning and gets started on a detailed critique. In all this light hearted comedy we are watching the more serious evolution of the Devil King’s plans as his original plan of just gaining corporate and economic power to fund his future conquest of Ente Isla slowly changes as living in a functioning society helps him begin to see he went wrong the first time in his basic ideas of how and why groups of people successfully cooperate and live together. And underneath all of this, the manga series is dealing with the philosophical themes of what to do with someone who has done evil things but stopped, what good and evil truly is, whether or not the ends justify the means and how to handle knowing you caused horror to countless lives just because you didn’t see them as important. I am extremely fond of this series, and sad that currently I have to wait several months before I get the backstory of how the Devil King first gained his generals and combined his army. But I am glad I managed to finish the Return to Ente Isla arc without waiting months between each volume. That was white knuckled clutching pages gripping. Reading each volume of that arc months apart would have sucked big time.

1711192536.0,Guy Gavriel Kay and History: Some Recommended Reading,"I love Guy Gavriel Kay’s books. I haven’t read his full catalogue – only his *Sarantine Mosaic*, *Fionavar Tapestry*, and *A Brightness Long Ago* – but all of his books I have read had an emotional impact on me that few other ever have. The end of *Lord of Emperors* left me feeling grief, happiness, and heartache all at once!

Part of what I like about Guy Gavriel Kay’s books is how openly indebted they are to history – ‘history with a quarter turn to the fantastic’. By taking Justinian’s Byzantium or fifteenth century Italy, for example, and changing the names here and there, with a sprinkling of the supernatural, Kay is able to give greater emphasis to his characters. Rather than describe elements of his fantasy world in intricate detail, Kay can let our own understanding of the periods he is adapting do a lot of heavy lifting.

This is not to say that Kay is relying solely on his readers to fill in the gaps, far from it. Kay actually does a lot of research for his books, ensuring that he learns enough about different periods and places to properly paint them on the page (alliteration anyone?) to such an extent that we, the reader, can recognise where and when he is referring to in our own world.

For readers who do not know, in the ‘Acknowledgements’ of each book, Kay offers a run-down of what he believes to be the history books that had the greatest influence on his writing. This list, however, is just a smattering of the works that readers can pursue if they want to read a bit of history with a hint of the fantastic. So, I thought I would compile a list of secondary literature, in no particular order, that relate to the books of Guy Gavriel Kay that I have read (I won’t do the *Fionavar Tapestry*, as that is more like a 300 degree turn to the fantastic). Then, readers who are interested in the history behind the fantasy, like me, can find something that piques their interest. (**Note:** I have only gone for books and the occasional book chapter; there are too many journal articles out there to include in this list.)

*Sarantine Mosaic*

There is already a fairly comprehensive bibliography for the *Sarantine Mosaic* on [Bright Weavings](http://brightweavings.com/bibliography-for-the-sarantine-mosaic/), “the authorized website on the worlds and works of Guy Gavriel Kay”, which is full of excellent recommendations, particularly Alan Cameron’s *Circus Factions: Blues And Greens At Rome And Byzantium* (Oxford, 1976), still *the* work on the circus factions. Therefore, I’ll only mention a few works that have come out recently that will offer a more up-to-date perspective on Justinian’s Byzantium and Byzantium generally:

* P. Sarris, *Justinian: Emperor, Soldier, Saint* (New York, NY, 2023)
* D.A. Parnell, *Belisarius and Antonina: Love and War in the Age of Justinian* (Oxford, 2023)

* J.A. Evans, *The Power Game in Byzantium: Antonina and the Empress Theodora* (London, 2011)
* D. Potter, *Theodora: Actress, Empress, Saint* (Oxford, 2015)
* T. Daryaee, *Sasanian Persia: The Rise and Fall of an Empire*, Second Edition (London, 2023)

&#x200B;

*A Brightness Long Ago*

According to the ‘Acknowledgements’ section of *A Brightness Long Ago*, there were a few books that were particularly useful for the core story: Hugh Bicheno’s *Vendetta: High Art and Low Cunning at the Birth of the Renaissance* (London, 2007), Michael Mallett’s *Mercenaries and Their Masters: Warfare in Renaissance Italy* (Totowa, NJ, 1974), and Maria Grazia Pernis and Laurie Adams’ *Federico Da Montefeltro & Sigismondo Malatesta: The Eagle and the Elephant* (Bern, 2003 \[1977\]). As for the setting, generally, Kay cites Lauro Martines’ *Power and Imagination: City States in Renaissance Italy* (New York, NY, 1976). I would add:

* L. Martines, *Furies: War in Europe, 1450-1700* (London, 2013)
* M. Hollingsworth, *Princes of the Renaissance* (London, 2021)
* J.M. Najemy (ed.) *Italy in the Age of the Renaissance : 1300-1550* (Oxford, 2004)

* G. Ruggiero, *The Renaissance in Italy: A Social and Cultural History of the Rinascimento* (Cambridge, 2014)
* G. Lubkin, *A Renaissance Court: Milan Under Galleazzo Maria Sforza* (Berkeley, 1994)
* J. Stevenson, *The Light of Italy: The Life and Times of Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino* (London, 2022)

The next book I am about to embark on is *Children of Earth and Sky*. Kay has cited Catherine Wendy Bracewell’s *The Uskoks of Senj: Piracy, Banditry, and Holy War in the Sixteenth-Century Adriatic* (Ithaca, NY, 1992) as a major influence on both the setting and the story. However, unfortunately, this book is not the most accessible. I have found one book that might fill the same niche that is far more accessible, though: Noel Malcolm’s *Agents of Empire: Knights, Corsairs, Jesuits and Spies in the Sixteenth-Century Mediterranean World* (London, 2015).

I hope fellow Kay fans find this helpful!

1711186230.0,Three things you would like to change in you favorite fantasy,"Hello, folks. What are three things you would like to change in you favorite fantasy book or series?

&#x200B;

My example is Lord of the Rings, which IMO is the greatest fantasy ever made, buuuuut there a few points:

&#x200B;

1. I want to see a bit more lore in the original book :) Tolkien universe has one of the richest lore in whole fantasy and may be the richest of created by single person. But most of that lore is explained in other books and sources like Silmarillion or Tolkien's letters that was shared to public. So when i read Silmarillion for the first time, i realized how much you miss in LotR if you don't know the lore. Nobody would be hurt if there were a bit more explanations.

&#x200B;

2. Would be nice if female characters had a bit more space and time. I really like girls in fantasy, but not modern  super-unnaturally-strong-killing-everything-with-a-clap-of-fingers-mary-sue type, i mean like something more realistic and interesting. Galadriel and Eowyn are cool and totally give a good representation of strong female character, but they have not so much time to shine and there are only two of them. Arwen, unfortunately, doesn't have that time at all.

&#x200B;

3. Oh man, i like this book so much i can't even say what else i want to change, so maybe here will a point from child version of me, from the times when i read the book first time. I wanted Frodo to fight more, to do some more combat action. Because everyone in Brotherhood (even other hobbits) had good fighting episodes and made a good action, except Frodo and it was disappointing for me, because he was the main character and i expected more from him. Now i understand the reasons and why Frodo was made the character he is, all seems perfect for me now, but yeah, stupid and bloodthirsty 10 y.o. me wanted him to fight more.",Fantasy
1711175552.0,[Review] 11/22/63 by Stephen King - Time Travel both new and original," [https://www.noahchinnbooks.com/2024/03/22/review-11-22-63-by-stephen-king/](https://www.noahchinnbooks.com/2024/03/22/review-11-22-63-by-stephen-king/)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dkvmrzhf31qc1.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=0084d97a326078d637744c036c2514cd94559c30

Time Travel is a tricky business. If you follow the standard conventions, you might come across as cliche. Try something new and SF nerds may nitpick you to your grave.

*11/22/63* and the movie *Looper* share one thing in common, and that’s that they don’t spend too much time worrying about it and get on with the story. Granted, King’s work spends more time with it, but in a hands-on kind of way rather than exposition, explaining, and theorizing.

*11/22/63* is about a man who has a chance most of us dream of—to stop a major tragic event from happening. We’ve all thought about one or another in our lives. Killing Hitler, stopping 9/11 or Pearl Harbour, or maybe just saving your own parents.

The opportunity here is the JFK assassination, but one unique twist to the scenario is that the time window opens up five years before that, meaning he has to bide his time. Not that the hero has any intention of waiting until the day (though deep in our hearts we know going in it will come to that, hell the inside cover makes that clear enough) because there are other problems involved. Namely—what if Oswald didn’t act alone? He’s 95% certain he is, but given the length of time required to get to Oswald and the fact the past (the obstinate past) does its best to get in your way, he wants to be 99% certain before he kills the man.

All that said, 11/22/63 isn’t just about JFK. It’s equal parts love story. And a good one at that. I will say no more on the matter, but if you’re familiar with the general tropes of time travel romance, you’ll hear echoes of them in how this is handled.

Something else I noticed was something I might have been reading into it. Maybe it’s an over familiarity with King’s work, but there was a sense of moral dread throughout—the thought that despite our hero being on the sides of angels that somehow he’s wrong to try to assassinate an assassin. Homicide is never something to be taken lightly, and King makes sure that the superhero fantasy versions of such a time travel event are flushed thoroughly down the toilet. Right or wrong, killing changes a person.

What’s most surprising (and welcomed) is his choice to have a bit of a world overlap in his story. Fans of the novel IT will quickly realize that his first attempt at altering the past is set in a familiar time and place with a couple of characters from the book. This part of the story can be considered separate from the JFK storyline, however, in case you’re worried that Pennywise turns out to be behind the grassy knoll.

I recommend the book to any fan of time travel stories, King fans, or King fans who don’t care for horror (they exist!)",Fantasy

1711170093.0,The Will of the Many and a common complaint ,"I commonly see people say Vis suffers from being too good at too much, as can be annoyingly common in fantasy book main characters. I personally felt he was indeed conveniently skilled at most things - but it never bothered me because I felt that it was due to some reason we’d find out in the future. Did anyone else feel that way, or, if you felt the opposite, are there reasons you see that this is not a likely interpretation?

I’m also curious in general if there are other series in which a character is seen as falling into this trope, but there ends up being a reasonable justification for it, or it is done intentionally and actually works well within the story - not just that it can easily be ignored. 

ETA: great discussion, but my primary question specifically if anyone else got the vibe that we have yet to learn more about WHY he’s so good at things - ie there are reasons we don’t know yet. ",Fantasy

1711164446.0,"2023 Fantasy Bingo Write-Up | Oops, All Sequels!","SEQUELS BINGO

Coming back in with my second bingo of the 2023 Book Bingo!  My first card is [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1902qdl/2023_fantasy_bingo_writeup_all_female_authors_card/).  This is my third year participating in bingo and my fourth completed card!  

Last bingo, I desperately wanted a “sequels” square, but even though I got my wish this year, I decided that would not be enough.  I finish a good many series, but there are also so many that have gone unfinished.  Bingo was also encouraging me to seek out new books, sub-genres and authors which was keeping me from finishing previous series... and makes me start new series that then go unfinished.

As for my reviews, I find most books, in general, a 3/5 (I enjoyed it, it was fine), a 2/5 (I wasn't a huge fan, but it didn't actively appall me) and a 4/5 (I really really enjoyed it).  I rarely award 5/5 (these are change-my-life level books) and 1/5 (I hated it and regret reading it).

**THE BINGO** 

**Title With a Title** - Witness for the Dead by Katherine Addison (Hard Mode) 

Summary: Murder mystery is solved by a Sad BoyTM in the complex, hierarchical society you know from The Goblin Emperor.

* Very fun little murder mystery.  I liked the little side quests Thara had to go on to put down the dead.  The new characters introduced where all fun and the setting of the opera made everything very grand and theatrical. **4/5**

**Superheroes** - Flash Fire by TJ Klune (Hard Mode) – audiobook // also counts for: young adult

Summary:  Remember how you learned in The Extraordinaries that Nicky didn’t have powers and it was ok and he was still special and valid? Yeah, maybe rethink that.

* This was the only square that I had to read a new book 1 to then be able to read the sequel.  The audiobook version realy helped highlight; what a fun, youthful and smarmy voice Klune is able to capture.  Nicky is a joy and the other side characters are also nicely fleshed out.  However, I think this sequel severly undercuts the premise of book 1.   I was also not expecting a somewhat fluffy gay romance to delve into the ethics of police brutality?  **3/5**

**Bottom of the TBR** – Tehanu by Ursula K. Le Guin (Hard Mode) – audiobook / also counts for: mundane jobs (if you argue Tenar is a farmer / housewife)

Summary: Tenar is a farm widow who adopts a burned girl and Ged is sad about losing his magic.

* I love the first three Earthsea books (literally to the point of tears), but this feel incredibly flat for me.  Nothing happened?  Perhaps it succeeds as a meditation on having a quiet life and not defining yourself through more masculine flashy styles of success, but I found it boring. Tenar's viewpoint on life was interesting, but I wish it had been paired with actual events of consequence. **2/5**

**Magical Realism** – Tales from the Cafe by Toshikazu Kawaguchi (Hard Mode) / also counts for: POC author 

Summary: A seat in a cafe will magically transport you into the past or future.... though the seat has incredibly strict rules and should only be used to have overwrought emotional revelations of little actual consequence.

* I didn't like the first one and I didn't like this one.  I didn't feel like the stories made you actually invest in the characters or feel the deep pathos and melodrama the book thought it was evoking.  My main complaint, as with the first book, is repetition.  You don't need to repeat every single rule about going back to the past FOUR TIMES.  Sometimes the rules were repeated multiple times in the same story! . **2/5**

**Young Adult** – The Great Barrier** by Patricia C. Wrede / also counts for: mythical beasts

Summary: In a fantasy Wild West Manifest Destiny-style colonialist universe, Eff learns more about the communities across the magical Great Barrier and has a new magical beast to contend with.

* This book is essentially a rehash of book 1.  Eff, with slightly more self confidence, assists with magical naturalism near the Great Barrier, there is another magical creature threat, and she saves the day.  It also really foregrounded the problematic issues in the series for me, namely the utter absence of any Native Americans in a book about settler culture in the West.  **2/5**

_____________________________


**Mundane Jobs** –  **Children of God** by Maria Doria Russell

Summary: A new mission to Rakhat is being organized and Emilio Sandoz is forced to deal with what happened to him there..

* I find the Rakhat books some of the most compelling discussions of faith, aging, and the meaning of life.  This book really explored what it means to live life in the face of tragedy and understand that we are not masters of the universe and cannot understand things as they occur and sometimes not even with hindsight.  It was beautiful and made you re-examine old characters and fall in love with new ones. **4/5**

**Published in the 00s** – Pretties by Scott Westerfield (Hard Mode) – audiobook / also counts for: title with a title

Summary: Tally is now a Pretty, but rebels against her society.

* I only read this for bingo and am thankful that it wasn't worse.  It was simply very dated and mentioned what feel to me like hot-button issues of the 2000s like cutting, anorexia and self-image issues.  For a dystopia, it simply didn't feel as tense or as morally and ethically horrifying.  It introduced some interesting elements like the woods civilization and her friend Shay becoming a Special, but little resolved in this installment beyond removing Tally from the city (again) and her getting captured (again).  **2/5**

**Angels and Demons** - Hell Bent by Leigh Bardugo (Hard Mode) - audiobook // also counts for: horror (arguably)

Summary: Alex has to figure out to how to get Darlington back from Hell while also dealing with all sorts of nonsense being a student at Yale.

* The quest adventure of this book was really fun and extends Alex's trauma backstory.  It had some fun twists that caught me by surprise. The writing was really engaging and I just liked hanging out in the story.  **3/5**

**Five SFF Short Stories** – The Ladies of Grace Adieu by Susanna Clarke (Hard Mode) / also counts for: published in the 2000s

Summary: A few charming and impish fairy stories.

* It doesn’t add much lore-wise, but vibes-wise, it is exactly on point.  These stories feel like playful little games and are just fun nuggets.  I think my favorite story was Mrs Mabb. It almost had the feel of fan fiction, a fun stylistic experiment in a world already created and with no pretensions to needing to invent a new narrative of signifcance.  **3/5**

**Horror** – Curse of the Wendigo  by Rick Yancey (Hard Mode) // also counts for: young adult, mythical beasts

Summary: On a rescue mission to the wilds of Canada, Will Henry has to contend with whether wendigos are real or just an excuse for human depravity.

* Though this book is still targeted towards middle grade/YA, I was shocked at how viscerally violent it was with graphic dismemberments and a lot of shit smeared on walls and such.  There was also a pretty affecting and realistic sequence of slow starvation and getting lost in a snowstorm. It was the point of the point, but I didn't like the tension between imagined monsters and real ones.  Book 1 made such a point that monsters can and are real, despite how improbable it seems. I did like the juxtaposition of the desolation of the Canadian prairie to the madhouse of New York City. **3/5**

_________________________

**Self Published or Indie Publisher** – Sweet Berries by C.M. Nacosta / also counts for: mythical beasts

Summary: In the multi-species community of Cambric Creek, Grace, sad and divorced, has an voyeuristic experience and falls in love and lust with a mothman.

* Since smut is so subjective, I just happened to like this one more than the first book.  I appreciate the “same universe, completely different characters and story” approach.  The sex was well-described and fun and lots of descriptions of the mothman's soft furry body. **3/5**

**Set in a SWANA Country** – In the Labyrinth of Drakes by Marie Brennan 

Summary: Lady Trent is engaged to go the desert country of Akhia to create a dragon breeding program.

* This book is a variation on a formula I find to be very successful and thus I enjoyed it.  Brennan takes different global climate condition, different cultural group and invents a style of dragon to go with and writes a fantasy travelogue.  The allusions to real life are so close as to be obvious, but the stories she tells have a very swashbuckling old-school feel that I find so captivating.  I am also happy Lady Trent has some good things happen to her in this book as well as many bad obviously. **3/5**

**Published in 2023** – The Sinister Booksellers of Bath  by Garth Nix - audiobook

Summary: Magical documents are messing up Susan's life again and it's up to the booksellers and her to solve a series of murders with help from mythical creatures of England.

* I'm a Nix girlie and this was a disappointment.   As always, there is incredible ideas that are very visual and evocative (a garden of moving stone statues that you access via a map, an ancient deity in the Roman baths of Bath, swoon).  However, the plot around that revolved around it just felt tiresome.  I wasn't happy to be back with the characters from book 1.  It also didn't have as much of the deepcut UK mythological figures which was what I liked about book 1.  **2/5**

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities** - How the Multiverse Got Its Revenge by K. Eason (Hard Mode) – audiobook 

Summary: Rory Thorne finds an abandoned ship that has a WMD on it and her crew all whine about it.

* The first book was already pretty bad, but this one was worse.  So little of consequence happened and the author spent so long belaboring the little that did.  The pseudo-historical tone of the narrator’s voice was grating.  Everyone’s choices were so predictable, except when the plot just had to invent tension for no reason.  The only interesting thing is that in this book, the concept of a multiverse, rather than being “wide” (parallel universes, etc), is instead “deep” (like D&D planes, deeper levels of the same reality).  I also liked the concept of magic as algorithms and math, but it’s never explained well enough . **1/5**

**POC Author** – Jade War by Fonda Lee – audiobook / also counts for: POC author 

Summary: The Kauls and their clan No Peak battle the Mountain clan for supremacy in magical-jade-possessing Kekon.

* I read this and immediately followed it with Jade Legacy, so it is hard for me to distinguish my feelings about this one in particular.  The writing is beautiful, transporative and lush with a real cinematic feeling.  I liked getting to spend a lot of time in Espenia with Anden and getting to explore how diasporas interact with their home culture.  I also liked other broadening of the world map.  The ending to this book had me absolutely floored and was perfect and painful.  **4/5**

_________________________

**Book Club or Readalong Book** – Wyrd Sisters  by Terry Pratchett

Summary: Terry Pratchett's Macbeth in Discworld.

* Pratchett is like a easy, delicious snack.  The writing in this struck me as especially funny and I highlighted several instances of wordplay that struck me as particularly clever.  The character portraits were so deftly drawn and precise in their nature.  I liked all of the scenes the witches found themselves thrust into and I liked the inventive magics they had to concoct.  There is plenty that Pratchett bring to the story that makes it more than a variant Macbeth. **3/5**

**Novella** – Down by the Sticks and Bones by Seanen McGuire – audiobook 

Summary: Learn how Jack and Jill from Every Heart A Doorway get so twisted and disturbed.

* It was a little odd to read multiple years after the first book, but I think this would be a great Every Heart A Doorway chaser.  I really liked this as a prequel and I liked getting to spend time in one of the fantasy worlds.  It also made me think a lot about what it is to be a parent and how a person becomes who they are. I also just like Jack and Jill as characters.**3/5**

**Mythical Beasts** – Victory of Eagles  by Naomi Novik - audiobook

Summary: Lawrence, disgraced and a traitor, is begrudingly allowed to ride Temeraire to combat an invasion of Britain by Napoleon while Temeraire incites dragons to fight for their rights.

* This book is mostly functional as the middle book in a nine book series.  After the character turn of the betrayal of the previous book, it lets Lawrence really revel in his feelings, but he doesn't wallow enough to be a SadBoiTM which was sad for me.  It is also small book in scope and doesn't have any of the fun journeying and exotica of the previous books.  The best part was Temeraire and his interactions with non-battle dragons. **3/5**

**Elemental Magic** – Avatar: The Search by Gene Luen Yang (Hard Mode)

Summary: The GAANG searches for Zuko's mom, Ursa.

* I had high hopes for this, but the story felt very slight and yet simulatenously too long.  I couldn't help feeling that this simply might just have worked better as an episode of TV.  There is also a point of tension that I think is not effectively deployed and ultimately turns out not to be true, which feels like a real let down.  The new charactes introduced feel incidental and even a character who is called back to doesn't make as much of an impression.   **2/5**

**Myths and Retellings** - A Touch of Ruin by Scarlett St. Clair – audiobook 

Summary: Hades and Persephone porn, but what if they spent a lot of time angry and not fucking.

* I was already pretty peeved at the first book with the outlandish “New Athens” plot framework and having Persephone as a journalist and all of the silly modernization of the Greek gods into celebrities.  However, at least in that book, there was getting to know you tension, will-they-won’t-they and lots of hot sex.  In this book, Persephone gets into a bad situation at work which she lets herself remained trapped in for the entire book (despite literally being a goddess) and then gets mad at a woman Hades used to fuck.  She also does a really reckless thing with life and death.  I was mad at her almost the whole book and there wasn’t enough creative boning to make me forget that. **1/5**

_________________________

**Queernorm** – A Closed and Common Orbit by Becky Chambers – audiobook  / Also counts for: robots

Summary: Jane, a worker clone child goes feral and Lovey/Sidra, a former ship AI, tries to get used to the intricacies of having a body.

* I didn't like the first Wayfarers book and I didn't like this one.  It also felt like a real departure for book 1 which was all about a very diverse found family and each going on their own individual hijinks and learning to love each other.  I guess you get some of that with Lovey's friends.  I also found the narrative structure INCREDIBLY confusing.  Maybe Chambers is just not for me.  **2/5**

**Coastal or Island Setting** - The Bone Ship’s Wake by R.J. Barker (Hard Mode) 

Summary: Joron will do anything to get Meas back and the series wraps up beautifully.

* This book effectively clinches the whole series as one of my all-time new favorites.  In this book specifically, Joron serves as an interesting examination of whether the ends justify the means and who gets to decide what matters, especially for whole groups of people.  This book also hits you with some new information that makes you drastically reconsider certain characters and basic pieces of worldbuilding like place names. The ship crew grow and evolve and reach a logical end for their roles, sadly some by dying. **4/5**

**Druids** – The Land of Silver Apples  by Nancy Farmer  (Hard Mode) // also counts for: young adult

Summary: Jack gets blamed when a water fae both steals his sister and all the water in a town and has to journey into Fairy with friends new and old to get both back.

* I was simultaneously impressed by how much I remembered of the general arc of the story while also having forgotten almost all of the details.  Pegga is an exceptional new character and the book does a great job of keeping characters you know and forcing them to grow in new circumstances and adding new characters to broaden the world and the mythology.  Great escalation and no second book slump. **3/5**

**Featuring Robots** – Artificial Condition by Martha Wells - audiobook

Summary: Murderbot tries to learn how that time he went rogue and murdered a whole bunch of people.

* Not as memorable for a distinct plot, but Murderbot is ALWAYS memorable for his phenomenal voice and characterization.  I really liked his interactions with the ship bot.  It was also interesting to see Murderbot in the aftermath of getting so close to humans in book 1 and needing to figure out what that means for them and their future and their dark past. **3/5**

**Sequel** – Xenocide  by Orson Scott Card (Hard Mode) - audiobook

Summary: Ender has to solve how not to get exterminated by either the descolada virus or by the Fleet that was sent to kill them or a genetically obsessed genius girl bent on destroying him.

* Strong beginning and middle that felt to me like it went completely off the rails at the end.  The ending just felt a little too fantastical for what has been established as a relatively scientific series.  I really liked the descriptions of the obessesive planet of Path and found myself growing increasingly uncomfortable as I was put into their point of view.  I also liked the arguments for trying to be radically empathetic and understand the descolada virus and a form of life. **3/5**

**General thoughts on the Bingo:**

I was usually pretty shocked by my recall of most of the series.  I didn't reread almost any of the preceding books and I usually either remembered what had happened or could use some judiciously placed summaries and context clues to get up to speed on where the series was.  It also sometimes didn't really matter what had happened in more episodic series like Lady Trent.

I did read some books to series I was happy leaving unfinished at book 1, but I was so happy to have the impetus to finish some books that elevated their whole series to some of my top all-time (Bone Ship's Wake and Children of God, for example).

While it was fun to do two bingos and I'm very proud of finishing so many series, I think I might have overdone it on SFF this year and I think I will just do one bingo next year... but who knows? :)

1711164141.0,Books where religious machinations are being used for power?,"Been sucked into Dune lore along with the rest of the world these past few weeks and have gone down some rabbit holes about the Bene Gesserit, along with their machinations such as seeding planets with the Missionaria Protectiva. 

Are there any non-dune science fiction or fantasy books or series (I’ve already got the first 6 dune books on my list) that also explore the idea of religion being used as a tool by a powerful group to shape culture and civilizations? I’m especially interested if it focuses on the… I guess strategic(?) aspects of religion being used on people or used against one another. Bonus if there’s a holy war involved. 

Not really looking for alternative history about real world religions - purely interested in fictional ones. Though I guess I would count religions evolved from currently real world ones on a long enough time scale as fictional enough. (Yes yes, all religions are technically fiction and all that.)",Fantasy

**Title with a Title: Ghost Talkers, by Mary Robinette Kowal**

Premise: it's WWI, and the British military employs ""spirit mediums"" to get messages from ghosts who have died in battle. Ginny Stuyvesant, a woman from the US whose fiance is a British officer, has to find a traitor in the military. I liked this better than Kowal's ""The Calculating Stars,"" because I think the didacticism works better when it's farther from the present day. There are cases where the characters are like ""okay, let's consider how our prejudices may have interfered with our enemies' plans; maybe the allies we dismiss as unimportant or beneath notice are also people our enemies dismiss as unimportant or beneath notice, and therefore, they aren't moles!"" We get a cameo from an RL historical figure that would be gimmicky if it was the entire plot of the book, but works well for a throwaway joke. PS if you like the ""spirit medium"" premise, I strongly recommend ""Debrief"" from Paracelsus Games, a one-shot RPG designed to be played over video chat which wrecked me in the best ways!

**Superheroes: The Meister of Decimen City, by Brenna Raney**

In a world where superheroes and -villains are normal, Rex is a supergenius who has her own lairs complete with AI and genetically engineered dinosaurs; the dinosaurs' intelligence is evolving throughout the book. This sets up a bunch of comedy. After Rex breaks up with her boyfriend, one of her new guards/friends helps her realize that maybe the reason her relationships haven't worked out so far is because she's ace, and so this becomes a long-running plot thread about earnestly researching her identity and realizing ""hmm, maybe this is me."" It also comes with increasingly heavy-handed metaphors about her tastes in food. It's possible that if I hadn't read ""Hench"" this would feel more fresh, but as it is, there's a lot of mood whiplash; one minute people are being very earnest-millennial talking about asexuality and trauma, and the next, dinosaurs are saving the day. Maybe that's the point, but I found it jarring.

**Bottom of the TBR: Voyage from Yesteryear, by James P. Hogan**

Premise: decades ago, with war and nationalism and tensions flaring on Earth, scientists decided at the last minute to add some embryonic DNA material and caretaker robots on a scientific ship heading for Alpha Centauri, so a new generation of humans could grow up away from the problems of Earth. Now, a US-based colony ship that's been in flight for twenty years is about to land and meet planet ""Chiron."" The first chunk of the book is about the colony ship; the ideology of the people in power there is ""we must bring Proper Authoritarian Leadership and the Good Old American Way to these helpless infants, because without it, people from Bad Countries start believing that they deserve Rights and Equality and As You Know Bob, That's Terrible."" Given that this author rates pretty high on the yikestastic scale, I was suitably unnerved by this. But let me reassure you: this is not, in fact, true! Sometimes, the messages sent by important people in power, or even held by ordinary people, are wrong, and the narrative is self-aware enough to reveal that! Whew. Almost all of the conflict boils down to ""false flags"" and ""bad guys not comprehending that most people are decent and can be trusted to do their own thing."" Hogan wants to both point out the absurdity of our Earthling prejudices, but also, have a quirky ragtag squadron of misfits come to the rescue and blast open the doors to save the day, and I'm not sure you can have it both ways.

**Magical Realism/Literary Fantasy: The Master and Margarita, by Mikhail Bulgakov**

M&M consists of three-ish interwoven narratives. The first concerns the visit of Satan (he goes by the name ""Woland,"" which is apparently a Faust allusion I didn't remember) and his posse to 1930s Moscow. The gang makes trouble, handing out ten-ruble bills that disappear or turn to embarrassing foreign currency, but even the literal forces of darkness are no match for the resolutely materialistic Soviet regime trying, and failing, to explain away all the strangeness. The second is about the titular characters; ""the Master"" is a novelist who has faced intense criticism for trying to write a novel about Pontius Pilate, and his lover, Margarita, who fiercely believes in him. (Margarita is the cognate to Marguerite/Gretchen in Faust.) And the third is the story-within-a-story about Pilate, as told in turns by Woland and the Master. In some ways it's a suitable-for-Soviet-print, ""historical"" version of the Passion story without any of that dangerous supernatural stuff, but it's plenty weird in its own right. The edition I used had some useful afterwords (and endnotes for each chapter--it's an ebook, couldn't they have linked it? /petty gripe.) Even I did pick up on some obvious parallels between the outer and frame stories: full moons, thunderstorms, the symbolic Friday-to-Sunday timeframe of many of the events (also the case for ""Divine Comedy."") One thing I appreciated the notes spelling out and dumbing down is that a lot of the things you'd expect to see in the Easter narrative--last suppers, miraculous events--take place in Moscow, while a lot of the harshest realities of the Stalin era--show trials, secret police informants, executions--take place in ancient Yershalaim. It's a good way to avoid the censors.

**Young Adult: Princess of Souls, by Alexandra Christo**

Sometimes, ""YA"" is used as a pejorative. This is bad because 1. books that are actually in that genre can be pretty different from each other, and 2. the tropes that it can be a shorthand for (first-person POV, female lead, romance as a major plot point) aren't bad in and of themselves, so it comes across as men complaining about women. Unfortunately, the prose in this particular book is often at the level of ""YA as a pejorative."" Some of the language that the narrative uses feels very modern and not secondary-world in tone. Someone's words hit like a ""bullet."" The king manipulates people like ""chess pieces."" Nox joins the army, like his father, so the king refers to him as ""a legacy""--as in, legacy student? That phrasing is jarring and not very fantasy-Ancient-Greece to me. \[Also, this is the king who murdered the father for plotting against him. I feel like I would not keep reminding the kid of his family's history of military service. That has to be somewhere on the Evil Overlord List, right?\]

**Mundane Jobs: Light Years from Home, by Mike Chen**

Chen does ""complicated but realistic family dynamics"" very well (see also: ""Here and Now and Then."") The Chao family grows apart in the aftermath of an alien abduction. At times, it felt like the plot kind of repeated itself. We, the readers, know that Jakob really has been traveling with aliens, that's made clear from page 1. So his dithering about ""oh I can't tell them everything, just gotta complete my mission"" and his sister Evie's ""do I trust him? do I not?"" felt like a lot of back-and-forth and/or characters refusing to communicate just for the sake of complicating the plot. Similarly, when we learn early on that another sister, Kass, has held onto a memento their father believed was associated with Jakob, it's clearly going to be Chekhov's alien tech. The parallels between the family members were nicely drawn. At different times, the characters take turns doing things like narrowing their focus to one-step-at-a-time plans; making, and then breaking, promises to themselves about quitting smoking or keeping the peace; and being too responsible to gloat--most of the time. They may be neurotic, but they come by it honestly!

**Published in the 2000s: The Rabbit Back Literature Society, by Pasi Ilmari Jääskeläinen**

This has a great cold open: ""The reader was at first surprised, then shocked, as the criminal Raskolnikov was abruptly slain in the middle of the street, right before her eyes. Sonya, the hooker with a heart of gold, shot him through the heart. It happened midway through an essay on the Dostoevsky classic."" There's a curse or a virus or something strange stealth-editing some of the books in the town of Rabbit Back, and if you're not careful, it can spread and infect others! But then it detours into literary fantasy--there are some weird things going on under the surface in the mysterious disappearance of famous children's book writer, Laura White. (Thanks to the Goodreads reviewer who pointed out Ilmari Jääskeläinen's blog, which spells this out more.) I personally would have preferred more of the cursed library books.

**Angels and Demons: From All False Doctrine, by Alice Degan**

Premise: in 1920s Toronto, a pair of best friends meet another pair of best friends on a beach. Elsa Nordqvist is starting her masters' in classics; Harriet Spencer is a flirty, lighthearted undergrad; Peverell ""Peachy"" Peacham is an effervescent musician who can't hold a real job, and Christopher ""Kit"" Underhill is quiet but wise. When Harriet and Peachy meet, sparks immediately fly; Elsa and Kit are also quietly drawn to each other, but mostly interested in setting up the Harriet/Peachy romance. Elsa is talkative about her research, her childhood on a farm in Saskatchewan, and her attitude of healthy skepticism. Only when they're going their separate ways does she realize that Kit...is actually an Anglo-Catholic priest. Oops. Awkwardness ensues. Because this was recced as a fantasy, I'm primed to read between the lines and look for supernatural happenings, but the characters don't know that they're in that genre, from their perspective it's a meet-cute or an academic detective story for a long time. When I say this book stuck the landing, it *really* stuck the landing and my feelings of it will probably warm with hindsight. But it's hard to rec to anybody looking for a fast read, or even a clearly-fantasy read.

**Five SFF Short Stories: Ingathering: The Complete People Stories, by Zenna Henderson**

Premise: there was another world full of humans living a mostly-idyllic, pastoral, life, with lots of psychic powers, levitation, etc. They're also explicitly Christian (their version of ""Father, Son, and Holy Spirit"" is ""the Power, the Presence, and the Name""). But God, or the universe, decides they've had things too easy and haven't developed their gifts like they should, and plans to destroy the planet. The People have to build spaceships, scatter into semi-related groups, and evacuate, crash-landing on Earth in the Arizona Territory in the 1890s. From there, some of them find each other and live in isolated communities where they can levitate freely; others are separated and grow up with psychic powers they don't understand, searching for others like them. The stories range in time from the evacuation to the late 60s/early 70s timeframe; they often involve children and teachers in one-room schoolhouses, miners and ranchers dealing with floods and fires in the canyons, etc. This is a big volume that was preceded by two smaller anthologies, so both of those contribute ""frame stories"" that interweave with the main narratives, about Earth humans who meet and react to The People. (Like ""Stewards of the Flame,"" the People are just ""the People,"" their homeworld was ""The Home,"" anyone who's not part of the People is an Outsider, etc.) The o/Outsider POVs are the best, if you're looking for something like Steerswoman or Children of the Star in which an uninformed character has to gradually figure out what's going on. ""Captivity,"" ""No Different Flesh,"" ""The Indelible Kind,"" and ""That Boy"" are probably the standouts in this regard. The first stories to be published, ""Ararat"" and ""Gilead,"" are from the perspectives of People who already take their differences in stride, while ""Pottage"" is narrated by an Outsider who just happened to go to teacher school with one of the People who blabbed; these are more anticlimactic, and overall the stories can get samey. These kinds of POVs do allow a couple cute moments like ""no levitating at the table, kids.""

**Horror: What Stalks Among Us, by Sarah Hollowell**

""What Stalks Among Us"" is a YA horror novel about a pair of best friends from Indiana who skip out on their high school trip and get lost in a haunted corn maze. It's a fun look at the time loop trope, and the genre-savvy narrator often describes her possible reactions as video game dialogue trees. The depiction of the setting is very evocative; even though the overall setting is a corn maze, it features various Midwestern gas stations and restaurants inside. This will be a feature to some people and a bug for others, but it's also very earnest about topics like neurodiversity, body positivity, and (especially) the horrors of abuse and the importance of standing up for oneself to escape horrific relationships.

**Self/Indie Published: Silence and Starsong, Volume I, Issue I, edited by Joseph Knowles**

Some of the longer stories were able to worldbuild at their own pace. Two stories worked well paired together as reflections on the Cold War in an era of weapons of mass destruction: ""Archangel"" by Frederick Gero Heimbach was a very imaginative alternate history in which the Czardom survived, and Russian Orthodoxy coexists with modern submarines. In contrast, ""Hidden Empire"" by T.R. Alexander requires very few changes in history--at least, the history of the public record. The story's conceit for how the Pax Americana came to be is cynical, but all-too-believable. ""The Two Godly Fishmongers: A Tale of Strange Providences"" by Kevin White has a droll sense of humor. The characters are 1600s Puritans, so we get to see great names like ""Preserved Fisher"" and his son-in-law, ""Trout Roundtree.""

**Middle Eastern setting: Untethered Sky, by Fonda Lee**

It's a novella and a pretty quick read; the narrator, Ester, is a rukher who teams up with her roc to hunt landbound creatures, particularly the manticores that terrorize the kingdom of Dartha. Rukhing is a stressful career--many apprentices flunk out, or are injured or killed, before they successfully hunt. And Ester has a personal stake in the matter, since her mother and baby brother were killed by a manticore years ago, and her relationship with her father never recovered. There are also several mentions of birds taking a crap in this book. Good job, points for realism. Based on some of the blurbs, I think some of the themes Lee was trying to engage with were ""monsters"" and ""obsession""--the rocs are trained to hunt manticores, but if somehow the manticores were to be defeated forever, would the rocs and rukhers lose their purpose? Does the grueling training process produce humans who are just as ""monstrous"" as their bird partners? ""Innumerable tedious hours are spent training and hunting, leading to a few crucial seconds to prove oneself, and those seconds are often determined by sheer luck,"" rang true in the context of sports, but I didn't really think Ester came across as a monster or bad example.

**Published in 2023: The First Bright Thing, by J. R. Dawson**

Basically the repeating dynamic is that Rin sees the horrors of Nazi book-burning/the Holocaust/Hiroshima/one of her circus friends being killed by the bad guys, and decides We Must Stop It, no matter how much she burns herself out trying to fix the timeline. Then Odette preaches the virtues of self-care and reminds Rin that she's Enough and Valid and Worthwhile, uwu. And then a couple chapters later the roles have switched and Rin is the one patiently explaining to her honorary daughter figure (the circus' new illusionist) that they can't fix everything and we just have to take it day by day, uwu. There's a kernel of something in here about parenthood, and that even if you can't fix the trauma in your own life, you can still be inspired to fight for the next generation so that things can be a little better for them. But, regardless of whether you're talking about the horrors of the mid-twentieth century or, IDK, twenty-first century climate despair, it's *really really hard* to strike the balance of ""this is terrible and we must stop it"" and ""you're totally Valid, uwu.""

**Multiverse/Alternate Realities: The Frugal Wizard's Handbook For Surviving Medieval England, by Brandon Sanderson**

The setting is a slightly-alternate universe version of medieval England. The locals are Anglo-Saxons, whose bards speak in alliterative verse, and who live in fear of the Hordamen (Vikings) from across the sea. Their lives are hard, but they're very brave and loyal, and not dumb; in fact, their perspective on John's world (2100s Seattle) is very insightful. There's also Yazad, a cheerful monotheist from the Middle East who has come to Britain in search of adventure, and to spread the good word of...Zoroastrianism! This sort of character is a familiar trope for Sanderson fans, and again, I think he's very well-written here!

**POC Author: Readymade Bodhisattva, edited by Sunyoung Park and Sang Joon Park**

Unfortunately, most of the stories didn't click for me, for one reason or another. In many cases, it felt like the authors were kind of regurgitating tropes without creating characters I got invested in or worldbuilding that I cared about. I don't want to generalize or jump to conclusions from these selections, of course: it might just be that the editors' tastes are bleaker than mine! But for me, there wasn't much new or exciting. The story I found most original, by some distance, was ""The Sky Walker"" by Yun I-hyeong. Eight centuries after nuclear war, humans have different beliefs about how Earth bounced back--was it a dragon deity? Kindly aliens? Just human resilience? Meanwhile, in an area out beyond an enormous wall (that was originally the limits of a radiation zone), the descendants of exiles and a few others demonstrate gravity-manipulation powers that make them incredible trampolinists. And there's even an ""Ender's Game"" type of ""the enemy's gate is down"" reorientation/perception! The end sort of trails off to something vaguely about ""even if you can't make a revolutionary change in your own abilities/the social order, you can at least push the limits and create a little more freedom than was there yesterday""? But the setup was very compelling, I wanted more unique worlds like this.

**Book Club/Readalong Book: Inda, by Sherwood Smith**

The titular character, Inda, is the third child in an aristocratic family in a fantasy world. His elder brother is a bully, while his elder sister is a sweetheart. But while younger sons (who aren't expected to inherit) usually don't go to the military academy in the capital city, the rules change just as Inda is turning ten, so it's off to school to learn military skills, and demonstrate them in highly competitive wargames. Inda proves to be a natural leader, rallying people to him with humility and brilliance: even if he doesn't take credit for being in charge, he comes up with genius strategies like engaging the bullies in fights while the tiny kid who no one expects runs around capturing all the flags. So, ""Ender's Game,"" but fantasy. Except, ""Ender's Game""'s SFy worldbuilding is compelling--when I read about the zero-gravity battle rooms or the ""giant's drink"" RPG or the arcade games, I wanted to experience them. In ""Inda,"" there are hints of magic behind the medieval warfare, but it's so sparse that it's hard to be caught up in the wonder.  

**Novella: The Great Divorce, by C. S. Lewis**

Several of the ghosts were very well-drawn. Early on we meet an Intelligent Episcopalian ghost who is way, way too familiar as the progressive liberal sort who cares so much about being the right sort of open-minded chap that he's drifted away from, you know, actual faith. Another really strong character was a woman whose son had predeceased her. She's greeted by her brother, but all she wants to talk about is getting her son back. This was written in 1945, the same year that ""That Hideous Strength"" came out to complete the Space Trilogy, and five years before the first Narnia book was published. We can see early glimpses of some of the Narnian whimsy (lions playing in the grass! a unicorn stampede! even people afraid of being ""taken in"" in the double entendre ""deceived""/""received"" context the Dwarves use it). And the skepticism towards modernity that also appears in That Hideous Strength.

**Mythical Beasts: D (A Tale of Two Worlds), by Michel Faber**

""D"" is about a girl named Dhikilo, who is growing up in the UK but was adopted from Somaliland (which is contained within, but not the same entity as, Somalia; in some ways it's de facto independent, but it's not internationally recognized). So there's a sense of ""stereotypical portal fantasy protagonist has parents who are either dead or useless offscreen, but we should make this more diverse; Dhikilo's birth parents are dead and/or gone because she's from a liminal sort-of-country."" The book has plenty of allusions to Dickens (there's a ""Bleak House,"" the villain gives a speech where he quotes only the good halves of the ""it was the best of times"" intro), Narnia (always winter but never Christmas), Lewis Carroll (the mysterious mentor is Charles Dodderfield, instead of Dodgson), and maybe the Phantom Tollbooth (trying to be playful with language). One day, in the real world, the letter D vanishes and Dhikilo is the only one to notice. What's the connection between the Ds in our world and Liminus? Why is Dhikilo able to notice that something's wrong when no one else cares? Beyond the punny name, is there a reason that being from an unrecognized country matters, or would any refugee do?

**Elemental Magic: The Sword of Kaigen, by M. L. Wang**

The Sword of Kaigen handles POV and pacing really well. It kept me on my toes. I can recommend it highly on those fronts. If you want a story where you can't feel confident in what will happen next, it delivers. But explaining how would go into spoiler territory, which defeats the purpose. The geographical worldbuilding, on the other hand, was very rough. There are several ways to do ""fictional setting inspired by IRL setting""; I found that ""The Sword of Kaigen's"" approach veered into uncanny valley territory. Also, the infodumps were painful. In chapter two, we have a history class. I understand that the purpose is to contrast the propaganda version of history that students learn with the actual truth, but no one actually teaches history like this. Not even for the unit on the French Revolution, which is the one unit where my teacher was like ""yeah, you actually do need to learn a bunch of names and dates."" It's just attacking a strawman.

**Myths and Retellings: The Mythic Dream, edited by Dominik Parisien and Navah Wolfe**

I enjoyed the humorous tones of ""Fisher-Bird,"" T. Kingfisher's take on the Labors of Hercules. And while ""Across the River,"" Leah Cypess' version of The Legend of Akdamot/The Legend of Rabbi Meir and the Sambatyon got bleak at times, the way the narrator used his skills to defeat a bigoted sorcerer was fantastic. Indrapramit Das' ""Kali Na,"" based on Durga and Kali, and Alyssa Wong's ""Live Stream,"" based on Artemis and Acteon, both draw on the misogyny and cruelty of internet trolls and reimagine ways of bringing them to justice.

**Queernorm Setting: Unraveller, by Frances Hardinge**

Our hero, Kellen, has the gift of ""unravelling""--he can break curses, given access to enough particulars about the curser's means and motivations. The other protagonist, Nettle, and her siblings were cursed by their evil stepmother and turned into birds; Kellen unravelled the curse, and Nettle is now human again, but her brother, Yannick, has chosen to stay a gull. When Yannick and Nettle are close, they can communicate telepathically. The details of shapeshifting, like Nettle having to get used to walking again, and Yannick's reluctance to leave the sky together with his utility as a scout/mail carrier/secret weapon (he complains about it but he deeply appreciates staying close to Nettle), were all reminiscent of the *nothlits* from Animorphs--and if you know how much I love Animorphs, you know that's very high praise. Unfortunately, while Kellen has superpowers, he is also a fifteen-year-old boy with a temper, so he often spends time getting on the authorities' bad side and needing to be bailed out. The plot is a bit episodic in terms of ""go to point A, deal with miniquest 1, find clue that leads you to point B, deal with miniquest 2,"" and so on; it's also one of those plots that could be elided somewhat if the characters just communicated better with each other (although, again, they are all dealing with their own trauma and/or underdeveloped frontal lobes). But I enjoyed the mystery and puzzle-solving aspects; in terms of being able to reason though ""okay, realistically there are only so many viable suspects in this scene, who can it be,"" I found it satisfying (but maybe because it's ""only"" YA so I don't have to be ""really perceptive"" to make the right deductions, idk). And the twist of why a small village is surprisingly chill about the bog witch that's been haunting the woods for thirty years was impressive!

**Coastal or Island Setting: Stewards of the Flame, by Sylvia Louise Engdahl**

Jesse is at first horrified by the Meds and only secondarily, if at all, willing to embrace the paranormal. This means that he can be an effective audience surrogate; when Peter's arguments about the ultimate superiority of mind over matter or the pitfalls of an overly-zealous bureaucracy go too far, Jesse dials it back and goes ""hey, wait a minute, there are times when trading a little freedom for a lot of security is good, actually."" Which is good, because as Engdahl notes in the introduction/afterword, many readers will find this weirdly preachy, especially in the context of COVID. (""Stewards"" was written in 2007.) She mentions that there's a direct sequel and a later trilogy in the same universe (but with different characters) that some people might prefer even if they bounced hard off this one. Given the constraints of bingo, it might be a while, if ever, before I try those, so all I can say is: if you are a strong believer in government regulation of public health, there will be many parts you'll bounce off of, and it does sometimes read as a commentary on COVID even though it wasn't. The most yikes-inducing part for me was when a member of the Group somewhat-inadvertently betrays them; ""She was bipolar, and would have been diagnosed as mentally ill even on Earth."" Her impetus for rebelling against Undine's Meds is her terror of more electroshock treatment, which is an ""improvement"" over the 20th-century kind, but still not good. But yeah, ""the only reason someone would sell us out is because they really were sick"" is...kind of not a good look.

**Druids: Uprooted, by Naomi Novik**

In the beginning, Agnieszka explains that everyone expected her friend Kasia to be carried off by the ""Dragon"" (the wizard's nickname) in the once-a-decade selection process--the Dragon always chooses girls who are especially smart, or brave, or pretty, and Kasia is just the best at everything. But, to everyone's surprise, when Agnieszka reacts to his ball of magical fire, he chooses her instead! Not until later does Agnieszka (and the reader) learn that she has latent magical powers, and he's required to teach any potential magician he can; he doesn't go about this in the nicest or most transparent way, but he does. This is *not* a case of ""the protagonist is a Mary Sue;"" this is the case of ""turns out the narrator of a story about magic actually happens to be magical herself."" There's some heavy selection bias in terms of ""who would be telling this story,"" in much the same way that the kids at Hogwarts are not really representative of the UK at large, because they're all magical! There *is* a character who has Mary Sue archetype energy, and...it's Kasia, who is explicitly lampshaded as being the smartest and the bravest and the prettiest, and then has to deal with the aftermath of *not* being the chosen one, after everyone around her, for better or for worse, has been expecting that for her for basically her entire life. This is an interesting and (to me) relatively original take on the trope! Kasia and Agnieszka's relationship, especially after the choosing, is a big part of the plot.

**Robots: Hellspark, by Janet Kagan**

Tocohl walks in and basically solves everyone's problems with the power of...body language. Because behaviors like gestures, or how close someone stands to you, or what side of you they sit on, are all culturally dependent; if you can't get those right, you may be able to speak the same vocabulary as someone else, but you don't ""really"" know their language. Hellsparks, however, are completely fluent in every language, including their unwritten aspects, so Tocohl speaks to everyone like a native without them being consciously aware why or how. Then she engages in lots of ""noble lies"" to get the crew to get along--misleading one person to believe that a new kind of boot is fashionable on her homeworld so she'll cover her feet and not freak out the foot-taboo culture, lying to another when two cultures both clash over ""which side of your conversational partner is more honorable to approach on."" Some people learn after-the-fact that she was lying and just applaud her for the chutzpah; others never catch on. And, like, I think this is supposed to be uplifting! Even well-intentioned people will have culture clashes, but don't worry, with the right background information the hero can come in and save them from themselves! Instead, it hit me as fatalistic. No matter how hard you try, you'll never get anywhere unless you can miraculously master the unwritten rules which nobody will teach you, because nobody thinks they're actually that important. It hits *me* hard as an autistic person in a world full of neurotypicals; in this setting, the Hellsparks who actually know the unwritten rules are a small minority. We're supposed to believe that none of the interplanetary survey crew, not even the polyglot who's supposed to be the mission's language expert, knew this. The crew mentions that the cultural liaison who got them set up as a team but didn't stick around was a moron, but how often does that happen? The way it comes across is that the Hellsparks are superpowered individuals in a galaxy full of mundanes; either everyone should be wanting to learn what the Hellsparks can do, or the Hellsparks should come across as more condescending and patronizing to everyone else.

**Sequel: Wildings, by Eleanor Glewwe**

There are several ways someone could handle a story about the divide between the magical elite and everyone else. One approach would be to have the majority group be genuinely mundane, and grapple with the implications of ""yeah, it's just fundamentally not fair that we can't do what they can do."" Another approach would be to have halani have a different form of magic that's looked down upon for absurd cultural reasons; maybe halani magic involves more motion and body language and kasiri are just prejudiced when they deride it as inferior to their incantations. But the rather painfully kludgy approach taken here is for halani to have ""the intuition,"" which gives them gut feelings when the plot demands it, I mean, something important is happening. Again, maybe the target audience doesn't find this lazy writing, but I do, sorry. Rivka has an unwavering commitment to reunite with her brother, despite the obstacles society puts in her way. However, compared to Marah, I felt like there was more ""things falling into her lap"" than her initiative moving the plot. It just so happens that, for the first time in four years, political hero Marah has come forward to speak out against forced adoption before even hearing about Rivka and her plight. Rivka happens to be attending class with Marah's brother, so she reaches out to him in order to contact Marah, and he unsurprisingly is like ""you're just using me to get to my sister, everyone wants that, leave me alone."" But oh look, the plot grants them another reason to hang out.

1711148093.0,Book recommendation (cozy) library,"Hey everyone,
I’m looking for a book that gives me this feeling that I get of grand libraries. For example in Game of Thrones the Citadel. While the Citadel itself really isn’t that cozy I’d argue, the idea of having this fantastically big library and being surrounded by all these books and all this knowledge is very comforting to me. Are there any books that have grand libraries as a central part/setting? Thank you!:)",Fantasy
1711146308.0,"I have a soft spot for the ""stranded military unit / modern community must fight to survive in different timeline or magical world"" genre, but I'd love to read some examples that don't focus on America. Are there any?","If there's a more succinct name for this genre, I don't know what it is exactly, but major examples include things like S.M. Stirling's ***Nantucket*** trilogy, Eric Flint + guests' ***1632*** books, William R. Forstchen's ***Lost Regiment*** series, Taylor Anderson's ***Destroyermen*** and ***Artillerymen*** books, etc. These series are not often very challenging or much in the way of ""high art,"" but they are absurdly entertaining.

Still, they all focus on modern or near-modern Americans whipping a bunch of primitives into shape. Whether it's the complex world of ~1300s B.C., the Thirty Years' War, or quasi-alien worlds full of peasants fighting monsters and religious tyrants, the solution always seems to be a mixture of optimistic democratic speech-giving, rapid industrialization, and good old-fashioned rifle drill. Sometimes this comes from the noble citizens of a small town, displaced in time, and sometimes it comes from a Civil War-era infantry regiment dropped into some weird battle against dinosaurs or pseudo-orcs, but it has pretty similar contours throughout.

But it's not a genre that *should* be so same-y -- there's just so much that you could do with it. The trouble is that I don't know of anything else that really has. The only exception I've found so far is Harry Turtledove's ***The Misplaced Legion***, which isn't really ideal because his imaginary Romans just end up in a time and place with similar technology but also magic.

What else is out there that fits this bill, and especially if it does so from a non-American perspective? Where is the book about a longship of 10th-century Varangian Guards getting extremely drunk and waking to find themselves in the middle of the Bronze Age Collapse? Where is a trilogy about the entire army of Prince Charles the Pretender vanishing from the the Culloden Moor of 1746 and reappearing on a survivable planet with two suns and a race of sexy cat people? Where is my meticulously plotted thriller about Zheng He's fleet passing through a mysterious storm and reaching the Red Sea not in the ~1410s as planned but rather the late 11th century in the midst of the First Crusade? 

Any suggestions will be welcome. If it turns out that this genre really is just very America-centric, why might that be?",Fantasy

1711140886.0,What To Do When the Latest Trend Isn't For You,"There's nothing quite like a trend being for your tastes: you are overwhelmed with books all written to be exactly what you want. Everything is catered to you. Everything is fresh and amazing and great. Unfortunately, we can never have that for more than a couple of years, max, before another trend shows up. If we're luck, we like that one, too. If not? We feel let down.

It's tempting to look at this trend as a negative, but I want to encourage everyone to see it in a positive light. I could wax poetic about how it's vital for any genre to reach new readers, to have new themes or styles, and to push the genre boundaries itself. But, no one wants to hear that. Instead, I want to give you the truest, purest reason why it's a good thing:

>Finally, I can catch up.

The method I am about to outline works no matter what the trend is or what subgenres you like. It simply just needs you not interested in reading the bulk of the new releases right now. That's it. Easy.

So, if this is you, or if you're just bored of new releases, or if you just want to mix things up, here's some tips on finding new things to read.

# Read a Favourite Author's Entire Backlist

This seems obvious, but it isn't for a lot of people. It's actually a challenge getting readers to move from one series to another, even when by the same author. I'm not talking about across pen names, either; Jane Doe's series ABC series will struggle moving those readers to her new series, XYZ. It's just how it goes.

But this is a great time to read everything written by your favourite author. Get every single anthology they've ever been in (in the process, you get to read other authors you might've never come across before, finding new books to read via that path). Get their debut standalone novels. Get that weird chapbook of poetry they put out when their dog died.

Front list hits the dopamine and pays for that new fridge you desperately need, but backlist keeps you in groceries through thick and thin. So read an author's entire catalogue, and help buy them groceries for a week.

We used to do Author Spotlights here on the sub, where people picked an older author and read a bunch of their books then do a post about it. Why not give that a try?

# Read Anthologies and Short Story Collections

This one can be tough to do, as most people online only talk about the same handful of names. Now, there's nothing wrong with well-known places like Clarkesworld, TorDotCom (Reactor), and Uncanny Magazine - and you should absolutely support them. But in many cases, readers are already supporting them. Now what?

It's impossible to list all of the anthologies on the market. So, instead of doing the very obviously Big 5 ones, that are filled with authors all writing in existing universes (so that you'll find a new series to read), I'm going to list some themed anthologies. Just because if I can get you into some of these places, I bet you'll end up finding so many more books to read than you can in a lifetime.

For example, Canadian author and editor Rhonda Parrish had [done a lot of anthologies](https://www.rhondaparrish.com/home/publications/anthologies/). All themed, some series, some not. Swashbuckling Cats was very popular on r/Fantasy when it first came out (disclaimer: I have a short story in this), but how many of you know there was a follow up, Pirating Pups? Or that she's done a dinosaur anthology? So dive into a few of those and see which ones you like.

Have you read the [Brave New Girls anthologies](http://bravenewgirls.weebly.com/our-anthologies.html)? There's eight of them now! (I just started No 2 - the first story is amazing, so if that sets the tone for the anthology, it's going to be a wild ride).

Have you read [Belanger Books' Sherlock Holmes](https://belangerbooks.com/) anthologies? There's a lot of them, so if you need some gaslamp mysteries, they have a year of reading ready to go for you.

Since we're talking about mysteries, you of course need [Dames and Damnation](https://ticonderogapublications.com/web/index.php/our-books/137-damnation-and-dames) by Australia's Ticonderoga Publications. Might as well look about for EcoPunk anthology, too. Since you're there anyway.

# Check Out Some Small Presses

This is always tough because if you don't know it exists, how can you find their stuff? So, let's dive in. First, start with the entire Small Press AMA. Now, because I'm in this one, I'm going to, of course, call attention to the [Tyche Books AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/ld7ne2/from_the_great_white_north_we_are_tyche_books_ask/), but I think it's a fun read because you can tell nearly all of the authors know each other, and most of them (us?) have met each other. So it's a massive Canadian hangout AMA, with Thomas J. Radford who, while from New Zealand, we don't hold that against him.

But, of course, there's so many more! Check out the entire [Small Press AMA series](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/ama/small-press-friday/). They all offered so many different kinds of books within the fantasy genre, from non-fiction to literary to poetry to short fiction to just great novels.

There's also [World Weaver Press](https://www.worldweaverpress.com/), [Book View Cafe](https://bookviewcafe.com/) (who has Marie Brennan Sherwood Smith, and Diana Pharaoh Francis, amongst plenty others), and [Air and Nothingness Press](http://aanpress.com/aanorder.html).

Feel free to link small press, anthologies, authors, and collections in the comments! So do not despair if a trend isn't your thing. There's so much more out there for you to enjoy.

Edit: I forgot to add [Patty Jansen's ebookaroo!](https://pattyjansen.com/ebookaroo/) This is a great place for worldwide readers to find indie authors at free to cheap prices.

1711139541.0,2023 Book Bingo: Weird shit I read in the woods.,"Bingo Card is [here](https://imgur.com/a/qF50jWA).

At a coffee shop hangout with a friend last weekend, we got to talking about the different places we often read books. She listens to lots of audiobooks since she does a lot of driving for work and family. It got me thinking that I primarily read books in four places: in my apartment, at coffee shops, on climbing trips, and while walking on the treadmill. Yes, read a book on a treadmill. Pump that baby up to 3.2-3.4 mph and a 5.0-8.0 grade, and after an hour I can log 500 calories and a good number of pages. No, I don't use audiobooks.

Over the summer, I took about five months off work to go on a long mountaineering trip throughout the Sierra Nevada of California (USA). I brought two shoeboxes of books with me and made it through just about all of them, mostly reading in my tent and car.

So, here's some weird shit I read in the woods (and treadmill/coffee shops). Spoilers on content warnings that would spoil notable plot points or interpretations. All scores out of 5, higher is stronger.

**Title with a Title:** ***The Master & Margarita*** **by Mikhail Bulgakov**

* **Appeal:** 5
* **Thinkability:** 5
* **Weird shit?** Canonically so.
* **Reading location:** Treadmill
* **Date published:** It's complicated; written 1928-1940, published in censored version in 1967, published fully in 1973
* **Page count:** 384
* **Tags:** Russian literature, magical realism, USSR literature, allegorical, religious fiction, satire, Christianity, ""where'd the funny part go"", notable prose, classic, banned books
* **Content warnings:** Death, institutionalization, mental illness, body horror

*The Master & Margarita* is an absolute masterpiece of Russian/USSR fiction (and I stress the latter). I have the O'Connor/Burgin translation, which does admirably well at explaining more obscure references in footnotes without losing the plot or explaining it all.

For those unfamiliar: the Devil comes to Moscow, and boy does his retinue put on a show. Interwoven with vignettes of the stupid Moscovites who deny the Devil's existence to the Devil himself are selections from a reimagining of Jesus Christ's conviction and crucifixion under Pontius Pilate - which just so happens to be both the real story and also a story written by the titular Master. A great black cat named Behemoth drinks vodka and shoots better than a Texan in heat.

I've known people who read that book and come with vastly different opinions over its humor, with some thinking it's more horrific given the parallels to early Soviet lifestyle. Whereas I think it's an incredibly witty satire that is so strikingly heartrending in the last ten percent. Plus, the man had such a turn of words that it's no wonder some of his phrases have become idioms in Russia (""second-grade fresh"").

**Superheroes:** ***The Talented Ribkins*** **by Ladee Hubbard**

* **Appeal:** 3.75
* **Thinkability:** 2
* **Weird shit?** No.
* **Reading location:** Treadmill, apartment
* **Date published:** 2018
* **Page count:** 304
* **Tags:** Family, USA Deep South, USA civil rights movement, old protagonist, author debut
* **Content warnings:** Child abuse, gun violence, stalking, addiction, racism, >!adult/minor relationship!<

I don't give a flying fuck about superheroes, but I also wanted to use the book bingo as a way to genuinely break out of my own genre conceits. *The Talented Ribkins* is exactly that: a lovely story of superheros, but not all superheroish about it. You follow a 72-year old man whose family has certain powers: he can draw a map of anywhere regardless of whether he's been there, his younger brother could climb *anything*, another relative can belch fire and smoke with a snap like a firecracker... and they're all past their prime.

The story takes place in the USA Deep South, specifically Florida. I grew up there, and Hubbard perfectly captures how Floridian families talk. I know men and women with dynamics exactly as Hubbard depicts them; I can hear their voices in my head. (It's no surprise that Hubbard cites Toni Morrison as an influence!)

**Bottom of the TBR:** ***Labyrinths*** **by Jorge Luis Borges**

* **Appeal:** 4.5
* **Thinkability:** 5
* **Weird shit?** I owe the discovery of weird shit to the conjunction of a mirror and an encyclopedia.
* **Reading location:** Whitney Portal, Golden Trout Wilderness
* **Date published:** 1962
* **Page count:** 256
* **Tags:** Magical realism, Argentine literature, metaphysical, philosophical, short stories, essays, central conceits, influential, notable prose, metafiction, classic
* **Content warnings:** Murder, war, death, sexual content

I don't actually keep a TBR List - but if I did, Borges would've been on it for years. One of the most influential speculative fiction authors of the 20th century, Borges is notable for expressing classical philosophical concepts through narrative. He approaches ideas not by writing about them, but by writing about people writing about that idea or coming across it through strange means. It's the progenitor of everything from the SCP Foundation to Susanna Clarke's *Piranesi*. What if a society idealized subjectivity to the extent of denying the reality of objects themselves? ""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"" considers that. What if mankind lived in an infinite library? ""The Library of Babel"" runs with this as far as it possibly can.

*Labyrinths* also contains some of his essays, and these are painful. It's amazing to read someone in the mid-1900s write about how confusing Zeno’s Paradox is as if calculus hasn’t solved it centuries ago. Just take a math class for once, philosophers; writing confusingly and acting smug isn’t actually a cogent point. (If you ignore the essays, bump the appeal rating up to 5.)

**Magical Realism:** ***Pure Colour*** **by Sheila Heti**

* **Appeal:** 3.25
* **Thinkability:** 5
* **Weird shit?** Pretty weird!
* **Reading location:** Whitney Portal
* **Date published:** 2022
* **Page count:** 214
* **Tags:** Magical realism, allegorical, fucking weird, sapphic, mundane lives, notable prose
* **Content warnings:** Sexual content, parental death, death/illness, >!incest!<

This is the first draft of the world, and the artist is about to crumble it up to start anew. A woman goes to school where she takes art appreciation/history courses, meeting a man and another woman with whom she has awkward interactions as she cares for her dying father. Will she? Won't she? Why is there eighty pages of her being turned into a leaf?

It could be the most pretentious book I've ever read, the most sardonic, or the most secretly-horrifying (next to the Gene Wolfe on this card). I'm inclined to believe the second and third; there's some serious excoriation of the manic dream girl ideal and propensity of people to believe their life problems are solved one idea after another. The tone and word choice are absolutely bizarre; there's a part where Heti describes a spirit being ""ejaculated"" into someone not once but three times... and that's before the whole leaf thing.

... and then it hit me. >!This book is about the mind-destroying trauma of parental incest.!< It's all there. The word choice, the concept about how ""some people are bears who focus on the love of others"", the point in the beginning about how there's a man who's too much of a bear. What. Even if I didn't outright enjoy it, I kept thinking about it, and the frustratingly mundane novel ended up dripping in the horror/disgust continuum.

**Young Adult:** ***Mordew*** **by Alex Pheby**

* **Appeal:** 2.25
* **Thinkability:** 2
* **Weird shit?** Literally.
* **Reading location:** Michigan
* **Date published:** 2020
* **Page count:** 604
* **Tags:** Dark fantasy, metafictional, young protagonists, 
* **Content warnings:** Body horror, sexism, animal death, misogyny, sexual content, child abuse, >!child death!<

God is dead, and his corpse rots below the city of Mordew. It's the first line on the back of the book - and by the way, it's supposed to be a huge twist. Oh well. This is the first book in the Cities of the Weft series, which follows various cities ruled over by godlike men with extraordinary powers. Mordew is infested by the Living Mud, which pushes out body parts used for textiles and... other things. You follow a young boy who also has powers growing, and he is sent to help out the Master of the city of Mordew before joining a ragtag group of kid thieves.

Cool premise, but unfortunately one that's utterly buried in Pheby's attempt to write four different stories at once that becomes progressively scrambled. Is this coming-of-age? Is this an action movie? Why is my boy a tyke bomb? Now we're escaping the castle with a princess? The initial intrigue is fascinating, but it felt like Pheby didn't really know what he wanted to write, and an otherwise amazing idea with tons of metafiction in the way the glossary of the book is a spoiler is weighed down by bombast and ""big magic"" scenes.

Don’t believe the blurb on the back - this is NOT a *The Office*-like parody of work culture. This is a frequently sad, often tense, and occasionally whimsical view into the millennial struggle of never being at home. *Severance* takes on many meanings here, and all of them hit hard.

You follow a woman who works at a publishing firm that prints cheap knock-off versions of Bibles; think of those cloying ""Bible for Young Women"" productions. A fungal pandemic hits (this was pre-COVID!) that causes people to endlessly loops actions when they've experienced strong bouts of nostalgia. The woman continues working her job and monitoring systems with the expectations of a huge severance pay once her contract ends as the pandemic rages.

I used to hate short stories. Why read them when you can just read, I dunno, actual books? Well what can I say, I was a fucking poser. Short stories are amazing, and masters of the form are true masters. Borges, Butner, Shirley Jackson, and more work phenomenally well at unfolding central conceits.

 Butner's stories remind me a lot of Jackson in the slow dawning horror of it all. But where Jackson examined small town life and a woman’s place, Butner examines the traps of nostalgia and thinking life was better when. It's like science fiction meets magical realism; a true ""speculative fiction"" collection where you finish a story and stare at your tent's walls for a bit before drifting off into unsettled dreams.

* **Tags:** Experimental fiction, writing prompt, novella, Egyptian mythology
* **Content warnings:** Sexual content, misogyny, death, institutionalization

This was originally a writing exercise that Zelazny's friend Samuel R. Delaney convinced him to publish - and it shows. It's very clear that narrative and characterization weren't a focus, and that it's more about giving off the vibe of ""sufficiently advanced technology"" taken to an extreme of literal gods as opposed to a normative narrative. I think it was worth reading for that reason alone - I love experimental prose, especially where I can kind of be informed of the many ways to write a story that isn't a straightforward ""he said, they did"".

That being said, it's clear where Zelazny started becoming plot-focused, and that's where it gets weak. There are mini-characters and mini-stories that flit in and out of existence, and characterization changes as time goes on where the story doesn't really have the space for, nor does it prioritize that kind of engagement. It's best when it's weird and unknowable - as one would expect gods to be, especially transhuman ones.

I love Dick, but his ideas were always better than his prose. I actually think he was better as he got weirder with time; *A Scanner Darkly* and the ""VALIS"" trilogy are probably my favorite works by him. That being said, he was far stronger as a short story author. He gets those hooks into ya; you feel his paranoia and drug-induced psychosis through amphetamine-fueled writing excursions.

Where does one begin with this 400+ page collection? Well, it's got all the goodies here: from ""Minority Report"" to ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"". And I repeat that the ideas are better than the prose, though ""Second Variety"" was legitimately scary. Shame we got a shit-ass movie out of that one rather than another *Blade Runner*. If you're not familiar with PKD, then I cannot recommend this to you more. At the very least, his influence is enormous, wide-ranging, and incredibly important for science fiction and psychological horror. Just be prepared for some very 1960s-white-man views on women.

All of your favorite horror authors have been influenced by Machen. He's like the Black Sabbath of contemporary horror; Lovecraftian cosmic horror before Lovecraft.

This compiles his most notable short stories, most of them written in his 20s/early 30s before 1900. These stories are extremely important for the development of anglophone horror as we know it today, but perhaps their influence is better than their content. A few of the main stories are great gothic horror, though anyone familiar with Lovecraft et al. might find them quaint. The unfortunately named ""The White People"" is a prototypical example of the capricious fae; even more unfortunately, it's interminably boring. 

Still, it's cool to see where began cosmic horror in Western literature. Though I wouldn't recommend reading these unless you're interested in the history part; it's like listening to your favorite death metal band's cassette-recorded demos.

There is a disturbing amount of places in the Sierra Nevada with the eponym ""mosquito"". Thankfully, I did not have much of a problem at Mosquito Flat. To help break-up climbing days a little better, I started getting in the habit of reading for an hour or so in the morning while I warmed up before climbs. The first casualty was this short story collection of contemporary Mexican magical realism, almost all of which were published independently before collection by indie Small Beer Press.

Most stories lead on the ""fantastic"" side more so than straight-up fantasy; it's better to describe it as short-story magical realism (which is actually kinda rare). As one might expect, there is a lot of social and political commentary here alongside genuinely engaging narratives. My favorite was the vampires waiting for nuclear winter so they could hunt during the day.

I read Dune over 12 years ago in 2011. I strongly enjoyed it; and, this revisit has changed some of my perspective. Herbert doesn't know when to trust you to get things; so much of the subtlety of the book is undercut by the characters giving you one- or two-line summaries about whatever's going on. No! Stop that! The best part of this series is figuring out the intrigue yourself! Herbert feels terrified that a reader might be slightly confused about the macro-plot, which is ironic given the obfuscation around the Bene Gesserit and Missionaria Protectiva.

I also found that the book does a lot of telling rather than showing. We're told Paul is *special* and *precocious* from the start, but he just asks normal questions. We're told the Suk School has unbreakable conditioning, but the only example we have is someone who's broken. We're told that Thufir Hawat is a dangerous mentat, but he really screws up everything but one (Feyd-Rautha's gladiator battle). I almost feel like this is one of the few long books that could have been longer; we're given so much from the very beginning that feels subverted without establishment.

I still enjoyed this reread, but more for the ideas than Herbert's prose.

In another bingo I'm doing with friends, we have a square for Booker Prize 2023. For those unfamiliar, the Booker Prize is for works published in the UK or Ireland. Originally, they just awarded for stuff published in the Commonwealth/Ireland/South Africa/Zimbabwe spheres, but in 2014 it was opened to any English-language novel. Regardless, I have never been disappointed by a Booker Prize novel. Even books I dislike, I still gain *something* from, and that's where *In Ascension* falls.

As a kid, I loved Michael Crichton books for the exposition dumps, and they likely influenced my decision to professionally pursue science/maths. Yes, Crichton has tons of problems, but as a 12 year old I loved hearing the bullshit on chaos theory in *Jurassic Park* (if you think it's a big deal in the movie, just wait...).

*In Ascension* kinda gets me in that same bind; the main character is a marine biologist-turned-microbiologist from the Netherlands who is wrapped up in inexplicable terrestrial and extraterrestrial occurrences. The first section follows her on a boat that goes to a previously-undiscovered deep sea vent that's at least three times as deep as the Mariana Trench. Weird shit happens.

In a word, I loved *Piranesi*. Boy did I have fun imagining the various ways the House could be presented; I initially imagined vaporwave. It’s a good problem to have when my biggest criticism is ""I wish it were longer"". And I deeply, deeply do - not only to explore the House (that is God?), but to simply have more time with Piranesi before the plot hits hard, the resolution of which never truly lived up to the conceit. I wanted to learn more about the Drowned Halls or go on another mini-adventure like when Piranesi conducts astralgazing in the dark, windowless hall. I don't need hundrds more pages, but maybe a couple more snacks for daddy.

Borgesian is an easy analogy; I found *Piranesi* more abjectly beautiful and celebratory in capital-m Mystery, with the caveat that the epistolary format breaks down when the action and dialogue pick up in the second half. Sad, contemplative, yet affirming. The last sentence is a gutpunch.

How far can a statement piece go? I hit the ""I get it"" button about 70 pages in. *Tender Is the Flesh* got a ton of attention last year on BookTok through its gory, disgusting exploration of a near-future world where humans can no longer eat meat from other animals due to a virus, so now they eat ""special meat"" - a.k.a. humans specifically raised and slaughtered.

It's clear what Bazterrica wants you to understand: this is happening right now in factory farms all over the world. You're only grossed-out here because it's humans. Yet this makes *Tender Is the Flesh* read less like a book than a rant.  It's an allegory for killing animals that I signed up for but also got pretty quickly.

The two points I realized that this book was kind of dumb were when a set of characters unironically said “humans are the real virus!” and when a character who owns a human hunting preserve was explicitly said to own the Necronomicon. Can you be any more on the nose?

* **Content warnings:** All CWs are spoilers. >!Child death, sexual content, adult/minor relationship, psychosis, murder!<

Gene Wolfe is the mater at telling stories in the background. BOTNS might be the quintessential unreliable narrator, in which you must pay attention to omissions and lies to really get what's going on. His debut novel *Peace* is even more obfuscating. Lesser authors would handwave their characters' actions with ""of course he's telling the story, so there will be embellishments"" (i.e. Rothfuss). Wolfe prefers to have his characters tell the truth, just with the occasional change.

That's what makes this book so fascinating. It opens as a sleepy Midwest USA memoir, but as I got further I realized it's one of the secretly scariest pieces of media I've ever experienced. It's subtle about it: I have to actively engage with the events for the horror to dawn. As Neil Gaiman says in the foreword, you trust the author... but you also do *NOT* trust the author. How many murders can you count? What's actually going on with the adolescent he sleeps with who's totally really into him? What exactly went down in the family's barn?

I read this as a part of a real-life book club with friends. If that's not in the spirit for the bingo, then I'm subbing it for 2023's ""Family Matters"".

* **Tags:** Experimental fiction, novella, magical realism, UK literature, author debut, grief/loss
* **Content warnings:** Parental death, sexual content

Porter's debut novel(la) follows a man and his two young boys after the immediate, sudden death of their mother. A gigantic crow comes in to help them manage their grief through its singsong voice. Is it mocking them? Is it their friend? There are no names, it's just Father, The Boys, and Crow. (All is Crow.)

My favorite thing about this book is it shows how messy grief is. Grief is not a neat package of sadness -> anger -> acceptance, or however many stages there might be. Grief is disgusting, indulgent, and (occasionally) violent. This book shows that - from the cursing to the despondency to the piss and shit. And it's interwoven with absolutely heartrending statements on what it is to lose someone and the mess they leave behind. As stated early on in the book, it's an apartment of ""no-longer hers"", and it doesn't have the care that comes with slow illness.

Now what? I'm just supposed to go on with my day? Crow would laugh at that but also agree - both in literal and in intent.

* **Content warnings:** Body horror, cannibalism, war, gore, >!rape/sexual assault!<, >!parental death!<

*The Devourers* opens with an Indian man (the country, not Native American) meeting an attractive stranger at a party who tells him he's half-werewolf. After a skeptical and story-filled couple of meetings, the half-werewolf gives the man a series of scrolls and human skin, asking him to transcribe the story. The story-in-the-story reveals the half-werewolf's parents meeting, in which a tribe of skin-changers who eat humans and their souls come to India, and one rapes a woman to feel what it's like to have a child.

There's a point in the story where you read about the werewolf father's sexual assault. It's disturbingly, horrifically written, and I hated the character. His section then ends, you go back to present times, and the Indian man speaks with the half-werewolf and asks why he was given this to transcribe. I'm going to paraphrase what our main character said: ""Am I supposed to feel pity for such a horrible creature? He's obviously trying to justify himself!"" To say my eyes rolled out the back of my head would be putting it mildly. Commentary on the process of writing is great; when it's *that* heavy-handed, it's presumptuous, especially when you use rape as a plot device. It's one of the few times a book has made me angry because I felt like the author was trying to be Very Clever when in reality it felt insulting.

I don't care about elemental magic; the very concept makes me think of video games and banal fantasy. Actually, I'll restate that: I love it in Dark Souls and Diablo clones, I don't care about it in books. But like the Superheroes square, I wanted to make a good faith effort to step outside my circumspection.

Well, there's a nugget of a good idea here - a humble gardener finding his way around the ""no wishing for more wishes"" rule and all the time-travel hijinx that could come with that.  It's not a wacky, idea-filled romp as much as it is the kind of humor I'd write in middle school when I thought my idea of a semi-transparent purple dragon hogging the road was the funniest thing ever (nobody laughed when I read it aloud). Plenty of ""lolrandom xD"", little substance. It reads like it was written in an afternoon and then sent to print.

... and I feel bad saying that because writing is fucking hard, but I also try to embrace the feelings I have in books and assess why I didn't like something, acknowledging that evoking emotion is itself a goal of art. The book falls here too though; it's the lowest ""thinkability"" I have here because it just wasn't funny (not because I read it on the stairmaster).

Youth of an age and time might be familiar with *Just So Stories* - a collection of fables written by Rudyard Kipling to his daughter (referred to as Best Beloved). ""How the Tiger Got Its Stripes"" and all that. Well, have you read that shit recently? It's terrible. Kipling is like the poster child for the disaffected British colonialist who's convinced himself that Britain is doing good for its charges by bringing them honest civilization. Except, y'know, all the other stuff.

*Not So Stories* is an attempt to reclaim Kipling's legacy. It is an anthology of many authors who write their own takes on the content of *Just So Stories*. Overall, it's a solid selection that reflect on Kipling and colonialism's legacy. Topics include a camel getting her paid-time off at a corporate job, a Southeast Asian woman being told *Just So Stories* by a British man (meta! terrifying!), and spiders getting their silk. The best take Kipling's format and run with it; the worst are either cliché or feel like they were written for a different prompt. “Samsara” is unbearably cloying (what Gen Zer doesn’t know Freddie Mercury? did the author ever speak to a teenager?) and also not related to the topic.

* **Content warnings:** Strong sexual content, slurs, adult/minor relationship, sexual assault, psychosis, child death

There's a lot to unpack with *Dhalgren*. What even is this book? Nominally, it follows an unnamed Kid who travels to Bellona, a fictional city in the exact center of the USA cut-off by an unending, undefined catstrophe. Radio, TV, and telephone signals don't reach it. Some people still live there, others arrive. The kid experiences the various social goings-on and roaring cataclysms that constantly choke the sky with smoke.

*Dhalgren* is a fascinating, strange rumination on being a character in a book. The last chapter more or less redeems the fourth and fifth chapters, which feel like three hundred pages of “yeah?” “Umm.” and “Well…” plus copious amounts of sex and slurs that I haven’t begun to figure out (including adult/minor sex). One character provides a mind screwdriver, but is it enough? Is it aware of being unjustifiable? Is that an excuse to write dreg?

I prefer to view *Dhalgren* as an unfinished novel. Not in the sense of the writing not being done, but as in everything is not fully formed. What happens when your ideas aren't done developing? What if you plop in a character (Kidd) who doesn't have fleshed-out conceptions, histories, or personalities into a setting that isn't finished being developed? *Dhalgren* has a threadbare plot because the plot isn't written yet. People do things and wonder why they're doing them. Time skips happen because the characters aren't on the pages.

*Dhalgren* is one of those Great Books About Writing. Perhaps I didn’t topically quite enjoy it, but I’ve sure thought about it a lot.

Described as a ""post-apocalypse 1000 years ago"", *The Wake* follows Buccmaster of Holland, a landowner in Angland at the dawn of William the Conqueror's arrival. It's completely written in a ""shadow tongue"" developed by Kingsnorth, where Old English spelling and grammar is (mostly) used while eliminating Latin-derived words. Buccmaster's home is destroyed, and he seeks revenge by forming his own troop of Green Men who will strike back at the ""frenc"" occupiers. Throughout the book, he communes with Old Gods (""eald gods"") that include the spirit of a legendary blacksmith.

This is a fascinating book that's a whole lot deeper than either the initial or secondary conceit. *The Wake* is one of those books with a high Thinkability Index; regardless of whether or not I enjoyed it, I keep *thinking* about it. By Kingsnorth's own words in foreword and afterword, it's tempting to think you're supposed to consider Buccmaster a hero of the story. It's not a spoiler to say that's... not the truth - but the sheer destruction and horror of William the Conqueror's arrival is nonetheless demonstrated everywhere in this novel. A fascinating psychological profile that emphasizes the ""history"" part of the ""historical novel"".

It’s hard to write speculative fiction with a social issues bent in the 2010s and beyond without accusation of *Black Mirror*-lite. So, perhaps readers might be interested to hear some of the nine stories in *Exhalation* predate the show, and that they have more in common with the tradition of Borges and Argentinian/Chilean magical realism in addition to the contemporary issues of today (and yesterday, and tomorrow).

This was my first Chiang collection, and I loved just about all of it. I've written about ""The Lifecycle of Software Objects"" in one of the posts linked above. To recap: I respected how it follows the concept of digital creatures to its extreme end - what happens when software becomes obsolescent? When servers die? When people get horny for digital pets? I also found the title story masterful as a response to Kierkegaard’s ""leap of faith"". The only one I thought a little trite was “The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling”, which kinda failed on the dual-story part with the African analog seeming cliché. But it’s a small price to pay for the overall collection.

I didn't like *Annihilation* all that much (movie was cool), so I was prepared to just think VanderMeer wasn't for me. Well, the neon-technicolor artwork to *Dead Astronauts* called out to me at the local bookshop like LSD on a Tuesday. Only later did I realize that this is actually a sequel; it shares the setting and conceit of *Bourne*, though with different characters.

This is a hugely acerbic, mobius strip-esque novel that weaves in parallel realities and explores the concept of archetypes in a post-apocalyptic wasteland following an ecological disaster. Saying that means nothing; *Dead Astronauts* is, like so much of VanderMeer's work, a book where the prose and format are immensely important to imparting the surreality of death and destruction. In this sense, it's like ecological ergodic literature - you travel throughout different perspectives of machines, mutants, creatures, and survivalists in which the organization of words on-page tells you more about their lens and experiences than the actual words on-page.",Fantasy

1711132346.0,The Redemption of Howard Marsh,"So, I read the Redemption of Howard Marsh series, and I got to tell you, I found the author’s (Bob McGough) willingness to write “not to market” very refreshing. His prose is punchy, clever, and fun. 

IMO, the protagonist is an anti-hero, and is probably also the main antagonist, due to his self-destructive behavior, which improves throughout the series. The author gives you the option to like the MC and go on the journey for the redemption arc or dislike the MC and ride the train for the sake of a practically guaranteed train wreck, but either way the romp through rural Jubal County is very original, fast paced, and enjoyable. 

If you are looking for modernish rural fantasy, and don’t mind an MC that is heavily flawed, but just over half ass trying to be a better man than the man he is, give the series a try. I flew through the books and am looking forward to more. 

Also, free on kindle unlimited. ",Fantasy

That's probably the most basic gist of the book. There's also weird Japanese style vampires, a sarcastic girl, who is unrelentingly hilarious, Harry Potter-style digs at late-night products (a mustache embelisher is my favorite), a Kung Fu panda style relationship between the MC and his father (they run a noodle stand), and the world's cutest, but somehow maternal, fox familiar. Loved it.

Just don't go looking for an OP MC or an MC who gets a cheat to become OP. There's none of that.

Review originally on [JamReads](https://jamreads.com/reviews/mushroom-blues-the-hoffman-report-1-by-adrian-m-gibson)

&#x200B;

 

*Mushroom Blues* is the mold breaking debut novel of Adrian M. Gibson, the first book in the noir fungalpunk series *The Hoffman Report*, a deliciously dark and weird proposal which tells a compelling story while doing a deep social commentary partly based in the post WWII Japan (and you can totally see many of the influences of it in the city of Neo Kinoko, and in the Hōpponese culture in general).

Two years after its defeat in the Spore War, the island nation of Hōppon is under the occupation of the Coprinian forces, with its native fungal inhabitants suffering a difficult situation, shortages and the corruption of the ocuppiers; tension is rising as a consequence. Detective Henrietta Hoffman has been transferred to NKPD as a sort of punishment, and the apparition of the body of half-breed child forces her to pair with mushroom-headed officer Koji Nameko as part of her investigation; one that will take her on a trip into the heart of a city in the brief of war, crime gangs, and the corruption of the own colonizers.

All the story is told using a close first-person narrative voice, from the perspective of Henrietta, perfect to reflect the change she experiences alongside her vision and knowledge about the native population of Hōppon is expanded and increased. Hoffman is a character tortured by her past, who starts with a point of view that is incredibly racist against the fungal population, partly due to her lack of knowledge, and the perspective of war winner, but who progressively changes, opening herself, in a gradual trip (and sometimes quite literal).

Gibson has made a masterful work portraying through fantasy many of the problems created after the WWII and the American occupation of Japan, but not keeping it at the superficial aspects, but exploring often overlooked parts of the society, such as the rise of crime due to shortage and corruption and the own abuse made by the colonizers (general MacArthur is a good example). All paired with mushroom derived elements that add a layer of originality to his narration, creating some psychedelic situations.

A police procedural story that is not afraid to go deep and, as a result, we have an excellent debut novel; Adrian M. Gibson has created something unique that I can't recommend enough. I need the second book as soon as possible, because I want to return to Neo Kinoko.",Fantasy
1711119635.0,Book Review: The Hallows by HL Tinsley:,"**TL;DR Version:** Nuns with machine guns, a grim and gritty flavor, and a bizarre mystery I *had* to solve. An unforgettable reading experience!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6dgd73y3hwpc1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=90ea6772dc1af81d0433c9662a0d2e83678811bb

## FULL VERSION

I went into *The Hallows* by HL Tinsley blind, with no real idea of what to expect. All I knew was that when I read the first page—beginning with the line, “The Auld Gods love a trier”—I was in for a wild and unpredictable ride.

That proved true in every way conceivable, and I WAS THERE FOR IT!

The Hallows follow Camellia, a member of a crew of magic-users who work for and are controlled by the Church of the Auld God (religious order turned corporate entity, governed by a demon-looking Mother Superior. WTF?!). Camellia and his fellows are dosed with what is essentially a drug that gives them (and all those who possess the “Auld Blood”) access to their magical abilities.

The abilities vary: Camellia has heightened senses and instincts, Daffodil the bruiser grows exponentially stronger, Forget-Me-Not the dandy can sense and control the emotions of people around him, and the list goes on.

These abilities are *only* tapped into once dosed up, and the drugs are tightly controlled by his superior, Lavender, who also answers directly to the Church.

And this is where the story starts, with Camellia and co. investigating a magic-user who got his hands on the drug outside the Church’s control. Slowly, as the investigation continues, we’re drawn into an increasingly complex web of lies, half-truths, deceits, cover-ups, and conspiracies. Deeper and darker with every chapter until…well, let’s just say things get GRIMDARK in all my favorite ways.

Camellia was a cleverly-written character, one who was easy to immediately sink my teeth into. He’s a man running away from the expectedly dark past (a past that is tantalizingly unfolded before us one chapter at a time) and burdened by a great degree of guilt over his past actions. He is seeking redemption through his service and doing a poor job of finding it. He is complex, engaging, and utterly human from the beginning, and colorful enough to want to follow from start to finish.

This book immediately put me in mind of *Priest of Bones* by Peter McLean; it’s the same street-level POV, the same ugly side of humanity, the same scheming and manipulation. But where *Priest of Bones* expands outward and develops the world around the character more, this stays tightly focused on the one city and all that directly affects Camellia—from the mystery he’s solving to the burden of his past to the people in his immediate circle.

And the world…oh, there was so much to love about this world! From nuns with machine guns to Jekyll and Hyde-like transformations to the curious people in the Red Market to the eerie Lord of Spiders to the small, quiet places where people can just be themselves, it’s a beautifully rendered backdrop that keeps you spellbound on your journey along with Camellia and co.

This is my first HL Tinsley book, but it will certainly not be my last. One of the most unique and fascinating stories I’ve read in a long time.",Fantasy
1711118783.0,Books with romance or romantic subplots that you wouldn't necessarily consider part of the romance genre?,"Perhaps this is an odd or unclear question, but I'm looking for exactly what the title says. Does such a thing exist? I want novels that have romantic relationships in them without being a major focus of it. For example A Court of Thorns and Roses would likely be considered a romance book because of the prominence of romance, right? I suppose what I want is a book in which romance exists but it is not the main reason for the story. A big unfolding fantasy plot that happens to have some love

There is a possibility I am resisting the romance genre for no reason, and trying to find something for no real purpose. This is likely due to the fact I want to avoid my own writing falling into the romance category. I don't think I have good reasons for this, but the thought process has led to my question. I plan to change my thinking accordingly depending on if what I'm looking for exists or if I'm just avoiding a genre for no good reason. If I am, let me know! I'm typically a dark fantasy type of guy but I want to explore some love a bit and see that maybe I'm resisting a genre because of some bullshit hangup I've had growing as a person rather than what the genre really has for me. 

I apologize for rambling, just trying to make my thoughts clear so I can get an answer to my question.",Fantasy
1711118237.0,Magical school,"Hello! I recently finished The Empyrean #1 & 2 (2 was kinda meh, but w/e) and reread the Scholomance trilogy and I have really been enjoying magical school books. I'm currently reading Akata Witch which is almost ticking the boxes- but I wish it was a boarding school type experience. 

I've read Harry Potter, and it was formative when I was a child so perhaps that's why I am having such a hankering for more. I also love science fiction so I'd be down for a sci fi book that follows a similar format too, as long as it isn't hardcore military sci fi. 

Any suggestions you have would be appreciated! ",Fantasy

1711111120.0,Goose Bingo Row Four," I did Goose Bingo. Row four was full of short stories. First three previously posted, last one soon. 

**Loosey-Goosey:** Read a book that has not been bound together. Easy. I took **J.S. Dewes' The Exiled Fleet** out of the Libby library app. 

Honk Mode: Read the book while stretching. I reiterate I am too proud of my sedentary lifestyle to attempt this. 

A worthy sequel to The Last Watch, in which our soldier protagonists realised they’d been deliberately abandoned by their corrupt government and are now working on escaping the distant part of the galaxy they are on with what the diminished resources they have. It focuses on the Commander Adequin Rake and exiled Princeling Cavalon Mercer adjusting to their new roles. The true joy of these books is always the interpersonal relationships and camaraderie of the characters. I particularly like the one between Rake and Cavalon, which I honestly can’t tell if it is going to ultimately be romantic or not. Their mutual friendship, admiration and gratitude is so strong they don’t need anything else now, and considering Rake is mourning the death of a partner and Cavalon is only just figuring out that people can be good it would be forced at this point anyway. It is a good middle point of a series. Tells a complete story dealing with their immediate problems, gives a few plot altering revelations and sets up some intriguing loose threads of varying urgency.    
 

**Christmas Goose:** Read a holiday themed book. **Connie Willis: Miracle and Other Christmas Stories.** 

Honk Mode: Give a goose a gift. I don't know any geese. 

A fun lot of stories but I didn’t like them quite as much as her more famous ones, like Even The Queen and her Oxford time travel ones. 

Miracle: Trademark Willis office humour, in which a young woman determined to have a perfectly well organized Christmas season and carefully plan her way into romance is reminded of the importance of heart behind the season when her sister accidentally sends her the Spirit of Christmas Present (as in gift).

Inn: Another story about heart, in which a modern choir singer has to hide a very lost in space and time pregnant Mary and Joseph from her homeless hating, heartless minister. Poignant reminder of the youth of Jesus’s parents, as well as all the sorrow in their future. 

In Coppelius’ Toyshop: A jaded narcissist finds his well deserved fate in the shop of the title. Extremely well written. I wanted to punch the narrator. 

The Pony: Not a favourite. It was about receiving gifts you want but didn’t ask for.

Adaptation: Dickens’s Spirit of Christmas Present and Future give hope to a divorced bookshop worker whose time with his daughter is being encroached by his ex-wife. 

Cat’s Paw: A loving homage to English murder mysteries in which a famous detective goes to the home of a woman passionate about ape freedom over Christmas and ends up having to solve a murder. Willis might love them, but she also lovingly ribs on their flaws in this delightful story.

Newsletter: A woman comes to the conclusion that aliens must have taken over the brains of everyone around her because there is no other possible reason everyone is being so nice and reasonable over Christmas, right? A fun story.

Epiphany: I didn’t like this one. Went on a bit too long and I feel it didn’t end properly. It was an attempt at the Three Wise Men attempting to find Jesus in the modern day. 

 

**Gooseberry Pie:** Read a book featuring a gooseberry pie. I had to go on AO3 and search gooseberry to find [Dark Magic and Goosberry Pie - Eulalya - The Dragon Prince (Cartoon) \[Archive of Our Own\]](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20249896) 

Honk Mode: Gooseberry Pie is the main character. Oh come on, it was hard enough finding something featuring a gooseberry pie!

A fanfiction of the cartoon The Dragon Prince. It’s a very well written story from the point of view of a delightful eight year old girl named Claudia at a dinner (with a gooseberry pie), who is thrilled to be able to talk about her passion (dark magic) with the royal family when her father leaves to help her sick brother, utterly oblivious to the undercurrents and social mores around her. Unfortunately, knowing nothing about the world of the Dragon Prince, I was oblivious to these undercurrents as well. I could see Claudia not realising that she was shocking people and being gauche, but being unfamiliar with the world I didn’t know why. But it was well written enough I didn’t resent reading it and I recommend it to fans of The Dragon Prince. It did make me interested enough in the world that I might watch it one day if I am bored and can easily get hold of it. 

&#x200B;

**Six Geese a laying:** Read six short stories involving geese. 

Honk Mode: All of the stories involve eggs. I managed 2 out of 6.   

1) The Goose that Made a Hurricane by Enid Blyton in Peter and the Magic Shadow. A story heartily recommended if you are seven and still getting the hang of reading, thus won’t mind the majority of the book being the same paragraph with names changed as the farmyard animals tell each other all about the amazing wind the goose believes she created. 

2) The Goose that Laid the Golden Egg by Aesop. A concise fable from ancient times about greed overreaching itself which plenty of people in the past refused to learn, plenty of people today refuse to learn and plenty of people in the future will continue to refuse to learn. 

3) Who’s a Goose by Scott Stuart: Quite a charming rhyming story featuring Bill and Bruce, two geese with Bruce trying to teach about what multiples of various groups of animals are and Bill getting in the way until the end when he has to rescue Bruce from a fox. Illustrations are an important part of this picture book. My favourite of all the children’s picture books I read for Bingo. 

4) Goose in a hole by Judith Kerr: Another picture book in which the goose couple Katerina and Charlie and their goslings wake up one night to find all the water in their pond disappearing. The story splits between Katerina leading her family through various underground holes and pipes trying to find a new pond and the villagers trying to refill their pond. An adequate children’s picture book. 

5) The Goose Girl in Grimms Tales for Young and Old translated by Ralph Manheim: A story I read to see how close Hale’s Goose Girl was. I can see why it was a favourite fairy tale of hers, it has everything a proper fairy tale should. 

6) The Golden Goose in Grimms Tales for Young and Old translated by Ralph Manheim: I was familiar with the tale of Blockhead winning the solemn Princess by his magical goose with golden feathers that had a whole parade of people attached to it. This story also had the tale of how Blockhead found the goose (being nice to the mysterious man when his brothers weren’t) and then getting the mysterious man to help him when the King tries setting impossible tasks to weasel out of giving Blockhead his daughter. 

&#x200B;

**Not a Duck:**  Read a book in which a goose mistakenly thinks it is a duck.  Okay fine. Nothing in this book states Goose believes he is a duck, but nothing indicates that he believes he’s a goose either. The library had it, I wasn’t willing to spend money on April Fools bingo and I doubt I’ll get a better book about a duck and goose with equal billing so I’m counting it as this 

HONK MODE: Goose is a duck shifter. See above. 

The story starts with Duck and Goose happy in their meadow when Duck decides they should go on a trip, ending up at the beach. Goose whinges the whole way until they arrive at the beach, upon which they switch emotional states and now Duck whinges while Goose has fun. Then they go home. I am more inclined to be charitable to the drawings as so many of them were of the ocean.  ",Fantasy

1711097513.0,A year in reading - My 2024 Book Bingo,"My bingo adventures began in february or march 2023, when I saw all the book bingo posts here and decided to check if I could fill a card with the books I had read the previous year (thanks Storygraph), which I did, and I got the name flair!

So when the new card came out in April,  knew I could do better, and I started to plan my reading year. From the start, I decided to do a queer themed card (and because I already read a lot of queer books, I decided to make it Hard Mode). It was such a fun card, and quite easy to do because most of the books I'd have read anyway.

Forward to June or July 2023. My card is almost complete, and I need a new challenge. I noticed that I haven’t been reading many books by BIPOC authors, so decided to try to fill up a BIPOC themed card. I pulled some books from the other card, rearranged a few things and went in search of a few new recommendations. This one is filled with many great finds, and the extra push to search for those authors was valuable.

So, at this point you can see that I read a lot. I’m in a moment in my life when I have lots of free reading time. And next to all the regular fantasy books, I was reading a lot of romance books in between. They used to be mostly contemporary romances, but I started to explore more the romances with fantasy elements. Which raised the question: Could I have a smut themed card?

That ended up being a fun card when I could use the books I was already wanting to read. But it was also the card where I questioned why I was doing this to myself at times, with three particular books that I shouldn’t have read, not even if they made me fill bingo squares.

In the end, I read enough to fill at least one more card, but I just don’t want to push it further.

Total books: 196 finished (until 21-03-2024), of which 143 (73%) were speculative fiction.

From the Spec Fic books:

64% had queer representation

32% had BIPOC representation

18% had disabilities representation

62% were new to me authors

At least 17 were Book Club books, 12 of which I activally participated on the discussions

Difficult squares: *Superheroes and Published in 00’s* where two squares that made me actively search for appropriate books, because they were not books that I would have picked up on the regular.

Favorite square: *Queernorm*. I just want to live in this square.

Confusion squares: *Mystical Beast and Middle East*. Are vampires beasts? Does India count as middle east? How to classify an author that comes from Ghana, Middle East and Brittain? Will the Bingo police arrest me and take my name flair? (Yes, that’s how my mind works. And I am still a bit afraid of publishing my cards)

For the next year, I’m planing on a disabilities card. I would like to do a BIPOC card again, and there were so many great new authors I discovered this year, that I’d like to have an old-to-me author card. Another idea is an immigrant card, because that’s my background and some of the stories I connected the most this year have had this background. However, I also want to read less this year, so I still don’t know what I’ll do.

1711086363.0,Hunter x Hunter manga has ruined everything for me,"I love reading be it manga or books. My favourite piece of fiction are Hunter x Hunter manga, Wheel of time, Realm of the Elderlings, JoJo Bizarre Adventure. 

But lately I just keep focusing on hunter x hunter and it’s latest arc, “The succession contest arc”

I believe the “succession contest arc” when finished will be one of the greatest piece of fiction ever written. There is nothing like Succession Contest arc of hunter x hunter. It has every single element that makes you think of good story telling.


There are few reasons I believe hunter x hunter is above everything else I have ever read


1. Magic System: Nen system is by far the best magic system out there. And it is not particularly close.

2. Characters: Some of the best character work in fantasy.  I just enjoy reading about every single character, not one character is boring, everyone feels like a person with a distinct motive of his own that is respected by the author.

3. Villians: I think no one does villians like Togashi Robin Hobb comes close, but the sheer quantity and quality of great villians such as Hisoka, Meruem, Chrollo, Illumi, Morena, Tserriednich, Benjamin, Camilla, Pitou, Pouf, Yuppi just edges out hxh as the best.

4. Battles/Fights: No other piece of media do fights like Hunter x Hunter and it is not particularly close. HxH simply have the best fights period.

5. Uniqueness of arcs: Each arc presents something wildly different from other arcs, so much so that it feels like I am reading some other book when the arc changes.

6. Plot: The plot of hxh gets complicated, current arc Succession contest arc took me 5 reads to get through my head the big picture, and that has nothing to do with writing, but simply it is a complex series with multitudes of plot-lines merging together.


Nothing else resonates the same way.


I hope to one day find something that makes me fall in love as much as I love hunter x Hunter.",Fantasy

&#x200B;

**Gobbelino London and a collision of catastrophes – Kim Watt**

**Bingo Squares: Self-published (HM),** published in 2023, mythical beasts (HM)**,** sequel (HM)

What it is about: This is the seventh and final book in the Gobbelino London, PI urban fantasy series, centred around the adventures of a mercenary feline PI and his human sidekick. It contains snarky cats and other gods, many bad jokes and terrible puns, plus a large serving of mythological and real creatures behaving badly.

**My Review: 4/5 stars**

So, I discovered this series through last year’s Bingo (non-human protagonist card) and I would say that for me it is representative of what Bingo is about. I probably wouldn’t have picked these books up if it hadn’t been for Bingo, but I did and I loved them and have stayed with the series until the final book. A collision of catastrophes does a great job of rounding the series up, it brings in elements mentioned throughout the series to finally solve a mystery that has been building for the last 5 books. This series certainly seems to have benefitted from being self-published in my opinion. It is clear Kim Watt has had a clear trajectory in the story she wants to tell, and this final book really benefits from her being able to do that. 

And the Gobbelino books are just good fun. Gobbelino is snarky and witty, as befitting any cat, and he makes the story what it is. As the main POV, Gobbelino carries the story along, making the books both easy and enjoyable to read. Whilst I don’t know if they would quite fit into that niche of cozy fantasy, there is something distinctly comfortable about them. The books are both light-hearted, whilst also having some more poignant moments in them.

**The Stardust Thief – Chelsea Abdullah** 

**Bingo Squares – Set in the Middle East (HM),** Title with a title, POC author, Myths and Retellings

What it is about: Loulie Al-Nazari is a successful merchant – hunting and selling illegal magic. However, Loulie is perhaps too successful, drawing the attention of the sultan who blackmails her into finding an ancient lamp. Accompanied by her bodyguard, the Sultan’s wayward son and a whole lot of secrets and lies, Loulie much survive ghoul attacks and vengeful djinn in an attempt to retrieve a lamp. 

**My Review: 4/5 stars**

I really enjoyed this story, I would probably categorise it as a “popcorn read,” one of those books that is fun and enjoyable to read but didn’t ask too much of my brain power. This isn’t a story that invoked particularly strong emotions in me, but never the less I had fun reading it, and felt it easy to pick up and delve back into. The story is easy to read, and well-paced, with POV characters who are all likable and distinct enough to add something to the story. The story had several twists and turns, some were easy to guess, others much less so.  

I am loving this new growth of SFF set in the middle east, and it is particularly great to see this from a writer of Middle Eastern decent. I don’t have any knowledge of The Arabian Nights tales (of which the Stardust thief is loosely based around) so it may well be that someone who is, would have a completely different review or thoughts on this book, but I suppose that is what the comments section is for.

**Assistant to the Villain – Hannah Nicole Maehrer**

**Bingo Squares: Published in 2023 (HM),** Mythical beasts, 

**What it is about:** With ailing family to support, Evie Sage's employment status isn't just important, it's vital. So when a mishap with Rennedawn's most infamous Villain results in a job offer-naturally, she says yes. No job is perfect, of course, but even less so when you develop a teeny crush on your terrifying, temperamental, and undeniably hot boss. Don't find evil so attractive, Evie.

**My Review: 2/5 stars**

Romantic fantasy just isn’t my cup of tea (please don’t ask why I chose this book for BB, I’m asking myself the same question), so this was not a book I loved. The main focus of the story is on Evie and the Villain, and their relationship as it moves from professional to something more. Whilst some of the dialogue between the two is amusing, the problem for me was that I just wasn’t invested in the romance. It seemed inevitable the characters would end up together and the build up just didn’t do anything for me. This also probably wasn’t helped by Evie, a character whose positivity in the face of death and torture seemed a bit nonsensical. 

The story also relied so heavily on tropes, that I am still unsure if it was supposed to be satirical and I’ve just missed the punchline. Although the pacing was in general, okay, there were still places where it dragged. I felt that with some ruthless editing the story could have been more focused and enjoyable. There is also almost no world building, we see the Villain’s castle and Evie’s hometown, but other that that I felt like Narnia could have been right next door, and we wouldn’t have known about it. A book can survive with limited world building, but if this is the case it really needs a stronger cast of characters to pull the story along.

**Backpacking through Bedlam – Seanan McGuire**

**Bingo Squares: Multiverse (HM),** published in 2023, mythical beasts, sequel (HM)

**What is it about:** Alice Price-Healy gave up her life for fifty years to focus completely on the search for her missing husband. The danger of focus like that is that it leaves little room for thinking about what happens after...and now that she's finally managed to find Thomas, she has no idea what she's supposed to do next. The fact that he comes with a surrogate daughter who may or may not have some connection to Alice's recently adopted grandson is just icing on the complicated cake. So the three of them are heading for the most complicated place in the universe: they're going home.

**My Review: 4/5 stars**

This is the twelfth book of the Incryptid series by Seanan McGuire, it is a series that I have loved from start to finish. Although Backpacking through Bedlam wasn’t my favourite of the series, I still thoroughly enjoyed this book. This is not a book you could jump into without the earlier novels the story is building on a series wide arc (war with the covenant) even as it finishes Alice and Thomas’ return home via several other dimensions. It does feel a bit disjointed and takes longer than I would have liked for the real action to get started. 

This isn’t to detract from the book, I still enjoyed it, I think because Alice is such an enjoyable character to follow. In earlier books she is a side character, but now as the main attraction, she shines and you really get to appreciate her loyalty and dedication. We don’t see a full reunion between Alice, Thomas and every family member (although I do hope we get this later), but it is nice to have Verity back and see how this character has grown since book 1, as well as the Aeslin Mice, whose absence in the previous book was sorely noted.

**Far from the Light of Heaven – Tade Thompson**

**Bingo Squares: POC Author (HM),** Horror, Features Robots

**What it is about:** The colony ship Ragtime docks in the Lagos system, having travelled light years from home to bring one thousand sleeping souls to safety among the stars. Some of the sleepers, however, will never wake - and a profound and sinister mystery unfolds aboard the gigantic vessel. Its skeleton crew are forced to make decisions that will have repercussions for all of humanity's settlements - from the scheming politicians of Lagos station to the colony planet of Bloodroot, to other far-flung systems and indeed Earth itself.

**My Review: 3.5 /5 stars**

As a locked room mystery, set in the depths of space, I thought this story had a lot of promise but just fell a little flat in its execution. I enjoyed this book, but for a mystery novel it just wasn’t as compelling as I would want it to be. Part of this, for me, is that it is difficult to be invested in a whodunnit mystery, when there are no actual suspects to try and second guess. The main character, Shell is competent, just out of her depth. I liked Shell as a character, and she felt believable as the sole captain in a spaceship, but in a lot of ways has to carry the story and at this I think she fell slightly short. There are other characters, but they felt two dimensional and almost misplaced at times. 

In terms of the story, the pacing felt very mixed, and in general the book could have benefitted from some ruthless editing. The first 25% of the book was much stronger, and Thompson does well to create quite an eery atmosphere as the initial mystery is first investigated. Unfortunately, this doesn’t continue, and I think it when secondary characters are introduced that the story seems to stall, with a myriad of different story lines that are introduced and then become increasingly convoluted. It then feels like the story ends quite abruptly, with several storylines left unresolved whilst the main mystery is almost spoon fed to the reader. ",Fantasy
1711060347.0,I think I'm realizing I enjoy romance in my fantasy (29m),"I'd like some recommendations.

I go into books mostly blind, but after several recent reads that happened to have romance/relationship plotlines, I find myself wanting to read similar things. I got back into reading fantasy and sci-fi 4 years ago, and my impression of the romance subgenre back then was that it was full of self inserts, love triangles, and toxic relationships. 

I think back then I wanted to be the hipster who only read Erikson, Robin Hobb, Guy Gavriel Kay, etc. And while I love those authors a lot, I refused to branch out. But a lot of my recent reads have just happened to focus on romance and characters working through relationships.

I think Legends & Lattes was the book that got me to start branching out. Then I read The Rise of Kyoshi (I'm a big fan of the show). Sword of Kaigen was a masterpiece that was completely driven by character relationships. I even like Sanderson's relationships in his later Stormlight and Mistborn Era 2 books.

These books all feature characters trying to navigate their relationships while also dealing with external problems. I think that's the dynamic I find interesting.

I recently read This is How you Lose the Time War, and I thought it was awesome! I've been completely wrong about this subgenre the whole time! So I went on booktube to find fantasy romance recommendations, and I don't know if I'm just not searching the right things, but it seemed every booktuber I found was just recommending ya or smut with love triangles, toxic characters, etc, lol.

Neither the relevant tvtropes nor Wikipedia pages made it obvious that some form of wolf dreaming is an established, more broadly known trope, though there's admittedly an enormous amount of fiction that has featured wolves in some way or another.

1711051023.0,Your Take On Reimaging Classic Stories And Making Them Dark? ,"Dorothy Must Die by Danielle Paige is a dark version of Oz. Which is a good series. There is the Zenescope comics dark versions of Alice In Wonderland although that series is excellent. Overall what are your thoughts on this trend - not that it’s new? I remember as a child reading many of the original Oz novels by Baum and never imagined a very dark evil Dorothy. 

Of course for movies we have a dark version of Winnie The Pooh. Not that Oz wasn’t rather dark but it seems supercharged more. Would an Oz novel written in Baum’s style work today?

It seems like there is a trend of taking classic literature especially young adult or children’s and make the stories as bleak and dark as possible. Yes it gets a wider audience especially adults but it also feels to be replacing original source. ",Fantasy

**Title w/a Title: Roger Zelazny - Lord of Light \*3**

This book might have been smarter than me. I know next to nothing about Hinduism and Buddhism which it draws heavily from, so I missed a lot of the references and felt lost a lot of the time, especially at the beginning. In any case, of the 3,5 Zelazny’s books I’ve read so far, I’ve enjoyed this one the least. I’d like to reread it someday, to try and see if I get more out of it, because I do think it’s a great book, it just did not gel with me this time.

**Superheroes: V. E. Schwab - Vicious \*3,5**

This was one of the squares I dreaded most, considering that I’m usually not into urban fantasy or superheroes, but I ended up pretty happy with my selection. It's different from the things I usually read, all edgy and clearly geared to a bit younger audience, but quite well written and very engaging: I devoured it over a couple days. Both main characters are pretty shitty people, but you as the reader still end up rooting for one of them over another. It's not something I'd want to read all of the time, but it was a nice break between some slower paced books.

**Bottom of the TBR: Ursula K. Le Guin - The Left Hand of Darkness \*5**

I’ve been meaning to try Le Guin’s sci-fi ever since falling in love with her Earthsea series some 15 years ago, but it would always get upstaged by some shiny new thing in my TBR. I’m so thankful to Bingo for finally getting me to read this amazing book! 

I struggled with it a lot, though. I started it the week when I had terrible brain fog and really shouldn't have been reading anything so cerebral. The first half of the book, therefore, was a real slog; I had put it down a couple times for a few days and the only reason I didn't abandon it for good was that I've wanted to read it for such a long time. The plot began picking up at the halfway point and I slowly started getting invested. And then came that incredible journey, which was one of the most beautiful, evocative, moving things I've ever read. I sobbed at the end of the book. I expected it to be thought-provoking, but had no idea it would move me like that.

Next morning, I went back to reread those early chapters that I struggled with at the first reading. I got so much more out of them the second time, when I finally cared enough about the world and the characters to pay attention properly. This book has since become one of my all-time favorites and I cannot wait to read more of Le Guin’s Hainish cycle.

**Magical Realism: Narine Abgaryan - Three Apples Fell from the Sky \*5**

I used to read lots of literary fiction before getting into fantasy and sci-fi, so this was right up my alley. I chose a book I’ve wanted to read for a while, and it was wonderful. It’s barely speculative, in the “folk beliefs that might have a hint of truth to them” kind, but basically, it's a tale about a small remote village nestled in the Armenian mountains, it's painful history and the stories of people who have spent their lives there. The pace is very slow, often not much happens, but it is written in such an insanely beautiful way that many times I felt my breath hitch and eyes water from the beauty or the heartbreak of it. It's not something I'd recommend to regular fantasy fans, and I suspect a large part of why I found it so dear was because it echoed some of my own childhood memories (I, too, have spent a part of my life in a slowly dying village where children are no longer being born), but it was one of the most moving things I’ve read in a long time.

(By the way, I read a Lithuanian translation, so if someone wants to read it on my recommendation, I cannot vouch for the quality of the English one).

**Young Adult: Naomi Novik - A Deadly Education \*3,5**

This book marked a big success for me, because it was the first audiobook I ever managed to finish. I think it was a combination of few characters, simple language, slower pacing and good narration that did it for me. I'm not sure I'll continue with the Scholomance series, but I enjoyed El's snarky voice and didn't find her as unlikable as many reviewers claimed.

**Mundane Jobs: Seth Dickinson - The Traitor Baru Cormorant \*4**

A book that I loved and hated in equal amounts (or rather, loved to hate).

It started strongly, then became dry and tedious in the middle. All the politicking, scheming, and logistics got a bit too much for my liking, and I thought it was turning out to be a pretty mediocre book. But then, Seth Dickinson completely blew me away with that brutal, brilliant, gutsy ending. It came out of nowhere despite it having been spelled out (quite literally) earlier in the book that this was were things were going. I hated Baru, I pitied her, I empathized with her, I hated her again. 

I will probably get to the sequels someday, when my blood stops boiling from this one.

**Published in the 00s: Michael Flynn - Eifelheim \*3,5**

This was a book I struggled a lot with, but, while it wasn't the easiest or most enjoyable read, it turned out to be one that lives in my head long after finishing. It's a first contact story that takes place in 14th century Germany, where an alien spaceship crash-lands on an outskirts of a small town. The story is told in two timelines, the medieval and the current one. I really liked the portrayal of the medieval village and its inhabitants, their vivid characterizations and their interactions with the aliens, though it did read more like a very meticulously researched historical fiction than sci-fi, full of archaic words and obscure historical references. By contrast, the two scientists in the current perspective felt very flat and stereotypical; I think that whole timeline could have been scrapped without losing much substance. 

On the whole, while I had some gripes with the book and it was frustrating to read at times, I’m glad I finished it. It didn’t go the way I expected it to, and that was a nice surprise.

**Angels/Demons: Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman - Good Omens \*3,5**

I watched the TV show a few years back and enjoyed it, but I haven't had the best of luck with Pratchett and Gaiman before, so I was a bit apprehensive about the book. It turned out to be a lot of fun, however, although I'd have preferred more Crowley and Aziraphale and less of the kids. While it probably won't become one of my all time favorites, I can see myself reading it again in the future.

**Short Stories: Iain M. Banks - The State of the Art \*2,5**

I went on a bit of a Iain Banks tangent last spring and read the five first books of his Culture series in a row. This book contains a titular novella plus a number of short stories, most of which are not related to the Culture. If I included the novella in the evaluation, my rating would be slightly higher, but this is about the short stories. Of those, however, I only enjoyed a couple: the heartbreaking Descendant and the absurdist, darkly funny Odd Attachment. Of the rest, I cannot recall a single one without checking the book, and that’s a failure in my opinion, since I usually find Banks’ writing very memorable and thought-provoking.

**Horror: Richard Matheson - I Am Legend \*3,5**

I’ve originally read Our Wives Under the Sea by Julia Armfield for this square, but was left disappointed with it and decided to put a book I enjoyed more on the final card. I Am Legend was among the books I read this year to get more familiar with classic sci-fi, and it ended up among my favorite of the bunch. I haven't seen the Will Smith movie, but for some reason I expected this to be a mindless zombie romp, so I was pleasantly surprised it was actually rather slow-paced and thoughtful. The main character's despair was so palpable it was hard to read at times, and I loved the chilling ending. Sadly, the book has not aged well at all in regards with attitudes to women and the strange fixation on the main character’s sexual desires, but if you choose to treat it as a product of its time, it’s well worth reading.

**Self Published: Marie Brennan - Driftwood \*4**

This is a little gem I might not have found if not for the Bingo challenge. It has a pretty original setting: Driftwood is a place where worlds come to die after they have suffered their various apocalypses. It's a patchwork quilt of different magical worlds, all of them slowly shrinking till they become no more than a neighborhood, then a building or two, and finally cease to exist. This short book is a collection of stories told by various inhabitants of Driftwood, all centered on a mysterious person called Last. While the premise might sound pretty dark, the tone of the book is surprisingly hopeful, if melancholic, and many of the stories have a feel of old folk tales.

**Middle East: Zeyn Joukhadar - The Map of Salt and Stars \*3**

This is another book that barely qualifies as speculative. It’s told in dual narratives, one of which follows a teenager fleeing the war in Syria with her family, and another tells the tale of an adventurer traveling the Middle East in medieval times. The latter, told in a legendary fairytale style, failed to draw me in; I always wanted to get back to Nour’s story in the modern timeline, which was more engaging. 

This book was sold to me on a promise of beautiful prose, but sadly, it fell on the side of trying too hard. The main character has synesthesia, and the reader is constantly beaten on the head with overwrought descriptions of everything around her. I also think that it could have been more impactful if the author chose a different protagonist. Nour, a young girl who was born in New York and only moved to Syria shortly before the war broke out, lacked a believably deep connection with the country to properly convey the devastation of her plight.

**Published in 2023: Jen Calleja - Vehicle \*3,5**

One of the most original books I’ve read this year. It’s about a group of researchers trying to piece together the circumstances surrounding a catastrophe that had befallen the fictional Isletese archipelago some years ago, and the mystery of the famous translator/musician/spy Hester Heller, who seems to be a central figure in those events. The reader is along for the ride, gathering the evidence piece by piece from letters, interview transcriptions and other incomplete documents. The world the novel takes place in, while fictional, mirrors our own bar some historical differences (for example, the isolationist and xenophobic Nation is clearly meant to be an alternative near-future UK). The disjointed narrative might seem confusing at first, but I really enjoyed the experience of solving this puzzle and I expect this would be a very rewarding book to reread.

**Multiverse: Susanna Clarke - Piranesi \*5**

This is the singular best book I’ve read in years, if not decades. Books like these are what I come to speculative fiction for. It felt like the best kind of dream - strange, haunting, yet beautiful and serene. The kind you get in that halfway state between sleep and wakefulness.

The first part of the book was my absolute favorite; I would have blissfully read hundreds of pages  of Piranesi exploring the House, describing the statues, talking to the birds and fishing. I was a bit nervous about the resolution of the mystery, but I’m glad to say that it was done with care and grace, like everything else in the book. I can see myself rereading it many times in the future.

**POC Author: Samuel R. Delany - Babel-17 \*2**

This was the first book by Delany I’ve read, and it might well be the last. Not that it’s a bad one, just completely not my style. I could not get behind the writing, grew ever more confused as the story continued and felt like I was tripping by the end. The central idea of >!language as a mind-altering weapon!< was intriguing, but underexplored.

Knowing that the book was published in 1966, it’s immensely refreshing to see a female main character who is not only allowed to have agency and personality, but also clearly stated to be neurodivergent. The cast is as diverse as they come, and there are also some quite progressive views on polyamory. The worldbuilding is where it feels most dated, though. It’s overwhelmingly wild, loud and colourful, a hodgepodge of ideas thrown together with little regard to how they fit together, way too much for such a short book.

I’m still glad to have read this book from a classic sci-fi education viewpoint, but it was my least favorite out of all the Bingo.

**Book Club: Ava Reid - A Study in Drowning \*3**

I decided to go with the audiobook for this one and am glad I did; the dreamy narration suited it very well. There were some things I really enjoyed about this book: the world that is not overtly fantastical, but has some sinister mysteries sprinkled through it; the folk tales that educated people scoff at, but that might just have some truth to them; the creepy atmosphere of a dilapidated manor. In the end, however, it felt like it focused on the wrong things. The premise was good, there were some really interesting worldbuilding concepts introduced, but it all got overshadowed by a lackluster romance with a very generic love interest.

**Novella: Arkady Martine - Rose/House \*2,5**

I really wanted to like this novella, since I loved Martine’s Teixcalaan duology, but it didn’t deliver for me. There was nothing really wrong with it, the creepy vibes were there, but they didn't lead to anything and several months after reading I can barely remember anything about the book.

**Mythical Beasts: Peter S. Beagle - The Last Unicorn \*3**

Regarding this book, I can only quote Molly Grue: >!“Where were you twenty years ago, ten years ago? How dare you, how dare you come to me now, when I am this?”!<

I really wish I’d read it 20 years ago; I think I would have loved it back when I was younger. As for now, while delightful and beautifully written, it was much too whimsical for my liking.

**Elemental Magic: N. K. Jemisin - The Fifth Season \*3,5**

I appreciate what this book was trying to do and I do think it did it well enough, but damn was it bleak. I suspect I oversaturated myself with post-apocalyptic/dystopian literature in my early 20s, because nowadays I find it hard to get invested in overly dark books. I need there to be at least some beauty and goodness in the world and some quieter, happier moments for the characters in order to give a damn. Here, too, I only started caring about the characters' fate after spending some time on the pirate island with Syenite and Alabaster. Until then, it was a constant feeling of trudging through.

The second person narration didn’t bother me at all; in fact, I didn't even notice it most of the time. But this wasn’t the first book I’ve read with this narrative technique, so maybe I’ve gotten used to it by this point.

Could somebody who’s read the whole trilogy please tell me whether the next books are as bleak as the first one, and are the characters also constantly being beaten down? I got moderately invested by the end, but I’m not sure I want to continue with the series if it’s going to be like that all the time.

**Myths/Retellings: Ann Leckie - The Raven Tower \*3**

Leckie's Imperial Radch trilogy is one of my favorite series, so I was pretty excited for this standalone; and while it didn’t exactly work for me, I give it credit for being one of the most original things I’ve ever read. 

One thing Leckie excels at is nonhuman characters. The narrator of this book is as nonhuman as you could possibly go, and their perspective is done masterfully. It was the absolute highlight of the book. The rest of it, though, failed to live up to my expectations. The pace was slow, which I wouldn’t usually mind, but this was boring-slow, and the detached narration led to me not caring much about any of the characters. All in all, I found this book an interesting and challenging read, but not a very enjoyable one. It’s one of the books which I appreciate having read more than I liked reading.

**Queernorm: Victoria Goddard - The Hands of the Emperor \*5**

I do not have words to express how much I loved this book. I’m a slow reader, I hate long books, yet I inhaled it in a week and lamented it was over. It’s the single kindest, gentlest, most heartwarming thing I’ve read in my life. I've seen Victoria's books categorised as cozy fantasy, and maybe it is in some ways, but it's absolutely *my* kind of cozy: kind and tender, occasionally heart-wrenching yet unbelievably cathartic, with none of the cuteness or quirkiness that often permeates the genre and which I personally cannot stand. It also very nearly was the end of my Bingo attempt, because after finishing it I could not stomach anything not written by Victoria Goddard for months. She’s my new favorite author and I’ll be feral about everything she ever writes.

I think I’ve gushed about this book all over the place enough that I won’t say more here, but I’m immensely thankful to r/fantasy for bringing it to my attention.

**Coastal/Island: Ray Nayler - The Mountain in the Sea \*3**

Based on its themes of first contact and learning to communicate with an alien intelligence, I should have loved this book. However, I think it was trying to do too many things in a too short of a time. The octopus storyline, which was the most interesting and thought-provoking, should have been central to the book and not just one of three very loosely interconnected ones. The characters were flat, I didn’t care about any of them, and the ending was abrupt and unfulfilling.

**Druids: Genevieve Gornichec - The Witch’s Heart \*4**

I enjoyed this book a lot. It was interesting to observe some of the major events in Norse mythology from the perspective of a character who only gets like two lines in the original sagas. It’s slow, especially the first part which mostly centers on Angrboda’s domestic life, but for me, this was a feature, not a bug: I immensely enjoyed the peaceful witchy vibes. The second part is quite different in tone, and I felt like it dragged a bit in the middle, but Angrboda finally got more agency here; and I loved the bittersweet ending.

My one gripe would be the dialogue: I think it was too modern and lighthearted for the mythical setting. I got used to it eventually, but at the first meeting of Angrboda and Loki it took me right out of the story. 

**Robots: C. Robert Cargill - Sea of Rust \*3**

A fun, gritty but not overly dark post-apocalyptic book (which was surprising, since in the time the story takes place, all the humans have been exterminated; but as it is told from the perspective of a robot, and the reader only sees a few snippets of the destruction, it doesn’t feel as devastating as it could have been). My main critique would be that much of the time, the robot characters felt so human, I would forget they weren't. It was a disappointment, because seeing the world from a very different perspective is the main draw of nonhuman protagonists for me. I also didn't much care for the ending. The last chapter read like an afterthought, as if the author chickened out and decided to end the book on a more positive note than originally intended, but it wasn’t needed and the story would have been much more impactful without it.

**Sequel: Martha Wells - System Collapse \*4**

I love Murderbot and was very hyped for the next installment, but it left me a bit disappointed. I found the beginning to be almost a slog (my mind was all over the place at the time, so maybe that’s on me, but Murderbot should have snapped me out of it). It picked up later, there were some beautiful and rewarding character moments, but it still didn't hit me in the feels as hard as the other books had. My opinion might change upon a reread, but as of now, this might be my least favorite book in the series.

It’s still Murderbot, though, so I cannot in good conscience rate it lower than 4 stars.",Fantasy

1711044386.0,Lord of the Rings vinyl,"I was reading today my History of Middle Earth book, when a thought popped in my head.   
*When I was growing up, my parents used to have vinyls with fairy tales on it. And I would listen to them for hours and hours. (I grow up in the middle of the 80 beginning of the 90).*   
So as I was reading the book, my mind came with this dilemma: How awesome it would be to be able to have the Lord of the Rings/hobbit on vinyl instead of cassette/CD! Audiobook on vinyl! So I decided to see if there's something like this in the world. And as I couldn't find it, I want to ask if anyone knows is I can buy the audiobooks of Lord of the Rings & Hobbit on vinyl?

1711044342.0,Which fantasy author has the best writing?,"By that, I am not talking about the craft of each sentence singularly. Authors can build on that aspect, but who’s the best author at structuring sentences together, that in all, combine to make a compelling, unique story?

Another way to phrase it: Which authors came up with a fresh and compelling idea and only had it amplified by their writing?

I’ve been obsessed with George R.R Martin for awhile. They’re very accessible.

I don’t think his sentence structure is ultra fancy or anything, but it still does enough to contribute to his story as a whole whereas most books don’t.

I’d say he’s 90% better than most fantasy authors and what’s being put out these days.

But who’s above him? I’m curious. 👀

1711044143.0,2023 (short) Bingo Reviews," Wohoo! I am very pleased with myself for completing bingo this year, as I fell with 3 books left in the last one. I am especially pleased because this year I decided to go with a full hard-mode card.

I did end up subbing out one square. I switched ‘Superheroes’ for ‘Hopeful Fiction’ from the 2018 card. Still did it HM of course. My standouts this year were Strange the Dreamer, The Sword of Kaigen and A Psalm For The Wild-Built. 

Here is my card, and below I’ll do some super-quick reviews about each read.

[https://i.imgur.com/a/ptfzY4A.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/a/ptfzY4A.jpg) 

**Title with a Title:** The Daughter of Doctor Moreau by Silvia Moreno-Garcia (HM)

I love Moreno-Garcia’s writing and her ability to create atmosphere but the plot of this one sadly didn’t capture me. Bonus points for a stunning cover though.

**Hopeful Fiction (SUB from Superheroes):** A Psalm For The Wild-Built by Becky Chambers (HM)

I really tried to do superheroes. I tried 3 different books and dnfed all of them. So I subbed it out for a random square from a past card and ended up with this! And oh wow I found a new cosy, utterly lovely favourite. I really like the way Chambers talks about heavy topics with hope, and the messages at the heart of this one really hit close to home for me. Adored it.

**Bottom of the TBR:** Strange the Dreamer by Laini Taylor (HM)

Someone tell me why I waited so long to read this! I adore Taylor’s prose, loved the characters and the story itself was just everything I wanted it to be. Following Lazlo on his journey to the place he’d always dreamed of, meeting Sarai, and uncovering the mysteries of Weep… ugh I want to read it all over again.

**Magical Realism:** The Cat Who Saved Books by Sōsuke Natsukawa (HM)

Not a huge amount to say about this one other than it was a bit weird but I kind of liked that. Plus, I’ll read anything with a cat in it.

**Young Adult:** The Hunting Moon by Susan Dennard (HM)

This was a solid follow-up to The Luminaries. Perfectly atmospheric (I love the audio narrator for this) and even though Winnie was still a bit annoying, I liked her character growth in this one. 

**Mundane Jobs:** Going Postal by Terry Pratchett (HM)

I am quickly becoming a huge Pratchett fan. Even though this is only the second book I have read. I love the humour and the whimsy. I love how he writes these larger-than-life characters. I love how you just get totally sucked into the stories. This was a ton of fun and I want more of it.

**Published in the 00’s:** Magic Burns by Ilona Andrews (HM)

A great sequel. I actually preferred this to the first book in the series. I liked ‘experiencing’ a flare (magical, not illness) and the chaos that happened during one. I also just really enjoy Kate as a character, she’s awesome.

**Angels/Demons:** Witch King by Martha Wells (HM)

Not a lot to say about this one. I liked the start of it. The set-up is really intriguing and the character of Kai is great. Unfortunately that’s about it because the rest of it I found difficult to engage with and it felt like a chore by the end. (I do, however, like Murderbot, so it’s not Well’s that’s that problem!)

**Short Stories:** A Phoenix First Must Burn, edited by Patrice Caldwell (HM)

This was a fantastic collection of stories. One or two weren’t my cup of tea, but that is to be expected with anthologies. There’s a wonderful variety of protagonists in these stories, fitting so many different character moulds. Teens and young adults alike will definitely take a lot from these stories.

**Horror:** A House With Good Bones by T. Kingfisher (HM)

I was dreading this square because I am nowhere near close to being a fan of horror. So I went with an author who writes what a friend of mine kindly dubbed ‘horror for wimps like you’. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this. While it is definitely extra creepy, it didn’t stray too far into actually scary, and I found parts of it surprisingly humorous. I’d definitely be willing to pick up more Kingfisher books now.

**Self Published:** Secrets of the Catalogue by Amelia Spencer (HM - 0 reviews at time of reading as I was gifted an e-arc)

The premise of this was perfection: A world where librarians actually enter the worlds of books… yes please! Overall I enjoyed this, it was definitely magical and it had a dark undercurrent which really fit the plot - you don’t know who you should be trusting. The MC could have done with some more fleshing out, but I am hopeful we see that in book 2.

**Middle East:** Girl, Serpent, Thorn by Melissa Bashardoust (HM)

I didn’t really have any expectations for this one however I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it was. It was an easy, fairly standard ya read, but I liked the twist that had our MC cursed to be poisonous. The writing had a fairytale quality, and I also appreciated the little lesson we got at the end with the author's notes on her mythical inspirations. 

**Published in 2023:** Ink Blood Sister Scribe by Emma Törzs (HM)

This was a fabulous debut novel with some very interesting magic, mystery and wonderful prose. I thought the author created really good atmosphere, building up a sense of danger slowly until it really quickly crested in way that made it very difficult to stop reading! This was another ‘book about books’ and I definitely will be looking out for more from Törzs.

**Multiverse:** The Space Between Worlds by Micaiah Johnson (HM)

This book was so great, why did I leave it till last?! I actually think this is the first multiverse book I’ve read and now I need more please. This story was so twisty and I never saw any of it coming, and I found the MC Cara so compelling! As a bonus it also really made me think about what my life might be like if there were 300 other me’s somewhere… I may have had a small crisis about it too. (If you have more multiverse rec’s please drop them in a comment!)

**POC Author:** The Vanished Birds by Simon Jimenez (HM)

I really love the way Jimenez tells stories. While this wasn’t as good as Spear (imo), I still had a great time. The first chapter was almost a book in itself (not the length, but the story), and it set the rest of the book up beautifully. This story spans a huge stretch of time, but it feels close and filled with emotions. I can’t ever say enough good things about Jimenez’s books, so just go read them.

**Book Club:** Emily Wilde’s Encyclopaedia of Faeries by Heather Fawcett (HM)

A great, fairytale-esque book about a scholar and her mission to document the fae. I had a lot of fun with this, not least because I adore epistolary novels. It took me a while to warm up to Emily, but once I did I was invested in her story. I also really liked how it leaned into the sinister side of the fae, which added to the fairytale vibe.

**Novella:** Overdue by Mark Lawrence (HM, I believe this is self-pub)

The Book That Wouldn’t Burn was a favourite from last year, so of course I picked this up as soon as Lawrence released it. It was a fun, quick read and it was interesting to see characters outside of the library setting. 

**Mythical Beasts:** Legacy of the Jaded Hart by D. B. Carter (HM)

This was a surprisingly dark young adult novel about two siblings who discover a family legacy and a secret order revolving around a magical hart (deer). I love a sibling story, and the relationship here was incredibly realistic. This is super fast-paced and I read it pretty quickly because the mystery was quite compelling.

**Elemental Magic:** The Sword of Kaigen by M.L. Wang (HM)

Oh how I loved this book. I haven’t gotten emotional at a book in a while, but this one got me. I connected so strongly to the characters, and they punched me in the heart. I don’t think I’ve read a book this fast before but I just could not stop thinking about it. I’ll be rereading this pretty quickly.

**Myths and Retellings:** He Who Drowned the World by Shelley Parker-Chan (HM)

I loved ‘She Who Became the Sun’ a heck of a lot, and book 2 did not let me down. It is breathtaking in its pace and its ability to tear at your heart from the very first page as we drop right back in with all the characters we love (love to hate?). Parker-Chan’s prose is lush and brutal and I loved it. Such an epic duology.

**Queernorm:** The Final Strife by Saara El-Arifi (HM)

I had super high hopes for this, and it fell a little short for me, though I did still enjoy this! The premise is really interesting and the world El-Arifi created here was really vivid. It took me a minute to warm up to the MC, but I ended up really liking the characters, and I enjoyed the plot, though the middle was a bit slow for me.

**Coastal/Island:** Tress of the Emerald Sea by Brandon Sanderson (HM)

Oh I loved this book. I adore whimsy and Tress had it in spades. I loved the character of Tress, and I also loved that all the supporting characters were well-realised too. The world was so interesting and unlike anything I have ever read before, and it was a lot of fun to uncover its uniqueness as we went along with Tress on her journey. I’ll definitely be rereading this.

**Druids:** Dreamer’s Pool by Juliet Marillier (HM)  
One I knew little about as it was a recommendation from the big thread here. I loved this. It reads as a classic fantasy and I didn’t realise that was what I had been wanting for a while. I loved Blackthorn as a character, she is so unlike any healer character I’ve read before. I loved the mystery, I loved watching Blackthorn develop and I just loved they way Marillier told the story. I picked up the second not long after finishing, and have the third ready to go.

**Robots:** The Cybernetic Tea Shop by Meredith Katz (HM)

This was a sweet, easy little read. I liked the characters and especially loved the exploration of Sal’s (the robot) very human emotions of grief and feeling lost while also knowing you are not human. Novellas can be hit-and-miss for me, and this was one that fell a little short. And I mean that literally because I would have liked to see more, it didn’t feel totally complete when I had finished.

**Sequel:** The Golden Enclaves by Naomi Novik (HM)

I loved the first book in this trilogy. I really liked the second. This one I just liked. I love Novik’s writing and that applies here, but I found the pacing odd and I felt like the characters were not really doing much for most of the book. I enjoyed the series overall, but It’s probably one where I’ll sell my copies.",Fantasy

&#x200B;

I just finished this book. While usually i'd give myself a day or two to process everything I really want to start To Green Angel Tower today as well! I read The Dragonbone Chair (TDC) back in 2022. Naturally I do not perfectly remember everything that happened in it. But my copy of book 2 thankfully has a summary of the previous book at the beginning of it! I would say a major difference between The Stone of Farewell (TSOF) and its predecessor is in the different points of view that are covered. As I remember it TDC is almost entirely from Simon's point of view. TSOF quickly breaks that trend with focus on 3 different groups: Simon's (Simon, Binabik, Sludig, and Haestan), Miriamele's (Miriamele and Cadrach), and Josua's (Josua, Deornoth, Isorn, Gutrun, and a few others). Over the course of the story we also cover events from multiple other points of view including the League of Scroll member Tiamak, Norn huntsman Ingen Jegger, Princess Maegwin, and Count Eolair. And it's for this reason that i've come to believe that this novel is superior to the first one from a writing standpoint. While I might actually enjoy the first one more, this second novel serves to better develop the world of Osten Ard specifically because its featuring stories across the land involving completely different groups. Simon and his group are trapped up north, with Simon eventually losing track of the others and ending up in the mystical land of the Sithi (Think Elves if you're not familiar with Osten Ard). Miriamele is all the way across the continent, constantly traveling from one place to the other by ship as she looks for allies. Josua and his group make their way from his destroyed kingdom through the forest and into the grasslands. Maegwin and Eolair are both seeking shelter beneath a mountain. So, we end  up seeing so many different places and peoples, with our different protagonists hardly being aware of one another. And even by the stories end they still haven't all met up with one another.

I don't want to oversell it, but I feel that this is *epic* Fantasy as it should be written. Deep lore, an expanding world, a larger cast working toward similar goals but not necessarily united, a mysterious evil enemy, etc. The land of Osten Ard gradually finds itself being plagued by a never-ending winter, but few people really know why. They think that maybe its a curse from God, but in reality its a spell from the ancient Storm King, Ineluki. Yet everyone involved feels the wrongness that is taking root in the land, even when they aren't sure what to do about it. I found all of this to be fantastic. I could go on and on, but then this would be way too long and I really should focus on a few crucial elements of the novel. For anyone who doesn't want to read further i'll say this: Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn is written in the same manner as Lord of the Rings. If you appreciate the works of Tolkien I highly suggest you give Williams' world a chance.

# The Basics

*They were all caught here on this high rock beyond the known world, all prisoners -- at least of circumstance. They were ignorant heroes, friends to oath-breakers*

&#x200B;

TDC ends with a somewhat bittersweet way for our heroes. Simon has obtained the mystical sword, Thorn, for Prince Josua and managed to fight off a dragon. But he has been scarred by the dragon's blood and lies wounded, slipping in and out of feverish nightmares. Josua's castle of Naglimund has fallen to his brother Elias, who used a force of evil Norns to breach his castle's defenses and slaughter almost everyone inside. Princess Miriamele, daughter of mad King Elias, has fled her uncle's protection and is making her way to Nabban, her mother's land, where she hopes to find aid. TSOF begins almost immediately after (Which I appreciate. No major timeskips outside of the weeks Simon spends recuperating from his ordeal) and things quickly continue to move in the wrong direction for everyone. Simon's friend Binabik is being held in prison by his people. Josua's group is pursued through the forest by the Norns. And Miriamele is soon captured by someone who is aware of her true identity. In different ways both Simon and Josua are informed that the titular Stone of Farewell is a safe place for them to reunite and begin planning a counterattack against Elias. For reasons unknown Miriamele is unable to be contacted for this information.

 So, the entire story ends up primarily being a long journey toward the Stone. While different forces of the Storm King chase after Simon and Josua we see Miriamele's path is a hunt for safety and security. Along the way each group has to deal with setbacks and side quests. Simon first has to figure out a way to free Binabik, then he has to deal with a fearsome wood witch, and finally he ends up being kept in the land of the Sithi against his will. Josua is plagued by his own doubts and failures, but valiantly tries to keep his remaining people alive while also moving through enemy lands and dealing with old feuds. Miriamele quickly discovers that the monk travelling with her, Cadrach, is not the most trustworthy person and though she does find sanctuary for a time she is quickly spirited away against her will. If Osten Ard is a giant chessboard every single protagonist is a piece being moved around it with almost no choice of their own. They make the best decisions they can at the time, influenced by emotion just as much as rational thought, and things do not always turn out for the best. Their enemy, thee Storm King, seems to know all of their moves well in advance. This is a story with the heroes holding their backs against a wall while a viscous monster stands before them. The tools to save themselves are their, but they sit just out of reach.

&#x200B;

# Simon

*Who would ever have thought someday I would see such things as this, have such adventures?*

&#x200B;

Simon is a character who I imagine everyone in this group can recognize. The kitchen boy who dreamed of going off to war and experiencing adventure has finally gotten what he wanted. Only he's found that it isn't everything he dreamed it would be. Facing a dragon was terrifying and came with great pain. His reward for doing so is pain, nightmares, and his friend imprisoned for the crimes of his past. And things really don't change for Simon in this story. He is trapped at that age between childhood, where others decided everything for him, and manhood, where he has to take responsibility for his own actions and words. This is made more frustrating for him because, as he laments time and again, he is hardly ever given the choice to do things for himself. His travelling companions are older and more experienced than him, and the loss of any of them to other obligations or merciless death is difficult for him to process. Yet Simon remains my favorite character in the books so far. Granted, TDC spend around 150 pages detailing his early life up to the present day conflict. I ended that book feeling as if Simon was a close friend, which makes me very sympathetic toward his adventures in this one. 

Still, Williams manages to capture the thoughts and feelings of a teenage boy out his depth quite well. Simon knows when he's acting childish, but he still speaks before thinking at times. He knows that the Quest he's on is important, but he is still almost overcome with simple exhaustion or despair at multiple points. He still wants to be a hero, especially in the eyes of Princess Miriamele who he first met in the guise of a boy, but more and more his thoughts of heroism are dispelled by the dire circumstances Osten Ard finds itself in. But almost all of Simon's reactions feel justified to me. He spends the final part of the novel being forced to live among the Sithi and at that point he is so terrified by isolation that I had to stop reading at points to process it all. Really imagine what it would be like to live among a people so different from you that they seem almost alien, and when you try to escape you're prevented from doing so by the land itself. More than once Simon compares himself to a caged animal and I suspect that had this situation gone on for much longer he would've contemplated taking his own life. 

Something that also happens during the story is that Simon begins to take the first bites of wisdom. Though it hasn't actually been that long since the first novel due to everything he has gone through in a short period of time Simon begins to reflect on his life. He looks back on his lessons with good Doctor Morgenes, the closest thing to a father Simon has had so far. I think these times are fascinating because its akin to seeing a child whose father always gave him advice finally discover the value of that advice. And it's made all the more tragic due to the quick, brutal way that Morgenes was taken away from Simon. And even as Simon continues his journey he also learns more about the great enemy plaguing Osten Ard, the Storm King. One thing I noticed about Simon is that while he isn't as wise as the long lived Sithi or even the older companions he travels with he has a way of looking at things where he seems to be able to...I guess not necessarily focus on just the bad. Or his own anger. Like there are times when he considers the Storm King, who as a member of the Sithi seems to hate humanity due to them encroaching on his peoples land and rights, with what seems to be understanding or pity. In this way I think that Simon is partially moving beyond those around him, even if he doesn't know as much as them. It's an almost innate ability to see other people and feel pity for them, even if they aren't necessarily worthy of it.

# Consequences/Death

*Now i'm free to adventure and i'm more a prisoner than ever.*

Not every decision a character makes ends in death, but every decision made has consequences and the characters are forced to deal with those consequences. It's a kind of responsibility that Williams places on his characters which I really appreciate. It's hard to put into words, but the characters come off as real people who aren't paragons of virtue or piety. Like this isn't the type of world where you'll do something like betray someone, get harmed for it, and then that person will just forgive you because he or she is just so good. For example, Cadrach is a drunken wreck of a man. Due to some unexplained tragedy in his past he seems to have lost all love of life and spends most of his time drowning his sorrows. This makes him the worst companion Miriamele asks for. While he doesn't outright work against her, I would say the first half or even two thirds of the story see's him being something of a burden. When its revealed that he sold her out for money she loses all faith in him. Much later, however, he does come to her with solid advice regarding things like being more careful about her identity and not trusting a nobleman who is clearly attempting to woo her. But because of everything that's happened beforehand she refuses to take his advice. And this makes sense. When she needed him to stand beside her he failed time and again. Unfortunately, she really should be taking his advice and because she doesn't she ends the story in despair, trapped by a man she thought cared for her and separated from Cadrach who was the last ally she had (And a drunken ally might still be better than no allies). Each character has made decisions during the novel which brought about consequences that they didn't want. And things progress the same for all of the other characters as well.

Now death in stories is hard to handle I think. Writers have an obligation to properly develop the cast, but death on dangerous missions is still to be expected. Yet some writers seem to struggle with killing characters off. And that can have a negative effect on my enjoyment of the story. This is fantasy. I'm willing to believe in a man being buried under an avalanche and digging his way out with magic, but even that can only be pushed so far. Eventually if you're doing things like having a guy be filled with arrows up and down his body i'm gonna start wondering why you're even doing that if he's just gonna live. Williams, however, will kill characters off with no fanfare whatsoever. Josua's group starts their journey with maybe 9 or 12 people and that number is almost cut in half by the novel's end. Some characters die quickly from wounds sustained at the end of the first novel, others are killed off during the constant attacks the group suffers in this one. Some of them don't even die on page. They die in between chapters and their loss is only mentioned. One of Simon's closest allies dies in much the same way. They get attacked by giants, he takes a hit meant for Simon, the rest of the chapter focuses on the fight from Simon's point of view, and a few chapters later when Simon wakes up after being injured its noted that his friend died. There's no glorious last stand or dying speech bidding Simon farewell. He's just dead. And this may lack things like emotion to some readers, but I feel there's a real rawness to this type of writing that is perfect for the setting.

# Sithi

*In the violet-tinged evening shadows, with his hair blowing, he seemed a spirit of the wild mountains. For a moment, Simon perceived Jiriki's immense age in his eyes, and felt he could almost grasp that great ungraspable; the vast duration of the prince's race, the years of their history like grains of sand on a beach.*

&#x200B;

The Sithi are written similarly to the Elves from Lord of the Rings, even down to being split into different groups spread across the land. And just as Sauron comes from the same place as Gandalf and Saruman the Big Bad Storm King is just an even older member of the Sithi. But what I really enjoy about the Sithi is how removed they are from everything else in the setting. You know how Elrond holds this great council and meets with Gandalf and the other wise people now and again to discuss the goings on in Middle Earth? The Sithi here don't do that. They've locked themselves away from the rest of the world and don't really care what's going on in it. They know the Storm King is around and attacking the land, but that's not there business (And might never be). It is only at the very end of this story when they are attacked that they start to *consider* getting involved (And note that's because the attack killed their oldest member). As I said earlier, Simon is imprisoned among them for the last third of the story and the experience nearly breaks him. More than any other group of ""elves"" that i've read about the Sithi are aliens among humans. They don't look like humans. They don't act like humans. They don't really seem to be able to understand humans. And I think its all fantastic. 

Not to say that all Elves should be written like this. Overall I find them to be very unnerving and if I were forced to live with them I imagine i'd lose it. But I think the Sithi are an excellent example at actually creating a different species of humanoid individuals and actually having them come across as a different species. SO many different series struggle with this, the characters being humans in all but appearance. I often wonder why some authors even bother creating a different species at all if there are no real differences. The Sithi stand out in their every action. Even Jiriki, a friend whose life Simon saved, doesn't quite manage to act Human and sometimes struggles to interact with Simon. And because of their advanced age I think that instead of the Sithi looking at immortality as this wonderful gift they see it as something of a burden. At the least it seems each of them will inevitably grow bored with life, or unable to really bear the way things change from one age to the next, and lose any enjoyment of it. That, along with the loss of their great cities, places on them the same sadness that many of their other counterparts in fiction have. A great people not only brought low, but who seemed doomed to lose everything they enjoy about life as well.

# Final Thoughts

*But though the world was vast beyond comprehension, still every mote of life in it fought for its own continued existence. And each mote* ***mattered****.*

&#x200B;

If The Dragonbone Chair is the introduction to Osten Ard, Simon, and the fight against the Storm King I would call The Stone of Farewell a sequel that develops everything from the original. Which easily makes it better as a story for me, but one that still requires you to read the original in order to enjoy it. This is in contrast to stories like the Tombs of Atuan, from the Earthsea series, which is almost completely disconnected from its predecessor. And this may be a case where I honestly can't think of a flaw in this novel. The previous one might have started fairly slow, focusing so much on Simon's early life that I could see people just dropping it altogether if they weren't interested. This one already has you in the middle of the epic adventure, which didn't end in the previous book when our hero faced a dragon. Therefore, things are already moving as the book starts and they continue moving ever faster as it progresses. By the end, as one group after another reunites, I would say the book is speeding along. While reading this story I was often so invested in one group's adventure that when it ended and switched to another group I was frustrated for a minute (Because hey if Cadrach bashes Miriamele on the head with a book and kidnaps her I NEED to know right now where they're going next!) , before quickly falling into the adventure of another group. Each chapter is long enough to grab your attention, but doesn't go on for so long that you start to get bored or forget about other characters being in dire circumstances.

1711033730.0,A review of Sweet Silver Blues (Garrett P.I. 1) by Glen Cook,"
 The one sentence pitch for the Garrett P.I. series is this: take a Chandler-esque detective and stick him in a High Fantasy world. Superficially, it might seem like an odd fusion – it’s hard to imagine Philip Marlowe as one of the members of the Fellowship of the Ring, after all(except when he’s played by Humphrey Bogart, because I’m pretty sure Bogie had chemistry with just about everyone). But, if you realign your thinking from the black-and-white Tolkien to the dust-and-dirt Moorcock or Howard, things start to make more sense. In fact, I think that Noir and High Fantasy merge rather naturally. They both trade on the inscrutable and arcane(whether that be magic or motives), and neither are much concerned with explaining themselves, rather relying on vibes to win the day. Beyond that, a conspiracy-minded Noir story is the perfect setting for cabals of witches and gangs of not-quite-human goons to strut their stuff.

Sweet Silver Blues opens with a hangover and a death and proceeds to bounce around from plot to plot for three-hundred-odd pages until they’re so tied up that you can hardly tell they're turning into a neat little bow by the end. For the Noir side of things, you’ve got it all in spades: layered conspiracies, questionable allegiances, head-scratching twists, and banter that’s almost too witty. On Fantasy’s end, you’ve got your witches and spells, undead advisors, and a half-dark elf sidekick that splits his page time smashing heads and complaining about Garrett’s non-vegetarian diet. It’s a big amalgam of ideas, but Glen Cook’s smart prose and expert dialogue ties it all together seamlessly. He tells you just enough that the misty nature of the plot never becomes frustrating. This is only the second book by Cook that I’ve read(I listened my way through the first Black Company novel while training for a marathon some years back), but I can see why he has an enduring reputation among big fantasy readers.

I had a lot of fun with the first entry in the Garrett P.I. series, and I’m eager to continue on to the next one. It reminded me a lot of the Vlad Taltos series by Steven Brust, a favorite of mine with a similar genre mashup(Vlad is an assassin to Garrett’s detecive). At points the plot is maybe a little too vague, and its treatment of women can be best described as ‘matching its genres’, but I’d recommend it to anyone who enjoys hard-boiled fiction or classic high fantasy.

1711024989.0,Bingo Tsundoku-off: Set in the Middle East,"The Japanese helpfully have a word for everything, including *tsundoku*: the phenomenon of acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them

Every bingo I say I want to read more books I already own, but never actually hold myself to account on that score. So what better way to do it than by overcommitting to not one, but two tsundoku-themed cards to help me make a dent in my TBR, and allow me the fun of planning how many different combos of cards I can make from a limited selection of books.

This square was tough despite being one I was excited for when the mod team put the card together...

[**A Wind in Cairo**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/263758.A_Wind_in_Cairo) **by Judith Tarr**

**Purchased:** secondhand book store, June 2021

Tarr was on my radar as an author that excelled in historically accurate settings, and in this regard A Wind in Cairo didn't disappoint. Others had also recommended her to me as being ""really good at knowing about horses"", which I would have to agree with... a good authorial quality to have for a book about a character being literally turned into a horse for most the novel. Unfortunately, the attention to historical detail is also what made this book really hard for me to actually enjoy. Our main character is a rapist, and while he is punished for this through the aforementioned horse transformation, he still ends up with a beautiful woman who, for 90 per cent of the novel, only ever knew him as a horse. I'm aware that things were not so great for women historically, but reading about it in a fantasy novel isn't always what I'm in the mood for, even when the author attempts to handle the subject matter with care. I'm keen to read more Tarr, but perhaps I'll be more selective about the plots I consider. 

**Rating:** 3/5

[**Priestess of Ishana**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42937710-priestess-of-ishana) **by Judith Starkson**

**Purchased:** kindle sale, October 2020

A Bronze age fantasy set in the Hittolian Empire felt like something new and exciting, and I was glad to have an excuse to finally read this book. Unfortunately, I never really connected with this book, for the simple reason that there's just way too much going on. The story races from plot point to plot point, without ever really stopping to pause. The characters are wishy washy, and make decisions that don't actually make much sense, but are clearly required to drive the plot along. And while I was excited about the potential world-building, we don't get huge amounts of it in this story, unfortunately. The main character is a priestess, but we see very little of what that actually entails beyond her sacrificing some goats.",Fantasy
1711024292.0,2023 Bingo Reviews (spoiler-free),"Having discovered the bingo card two weeks ago, and finishing the last 3 books for my card this week, I figured I’d post some quick reviews of what I read. I did try to keep it spoiler free, so it’s less in depth and more quick overviews

Title with a Title: **The Black Lung Captain** by *Chris Wooding*

Book 2 for The Tales of the Ketty Jet was exactly what I was expected, characters doing what they can in order to survive and thrive in a world of airships, monsters, pirates and more. For the sequel, I really liked getting to learn more about the world lore and mythology.

Superheroes: **Blitz** by *David O’Malley*

The Checquy Files is one of my favourite series, and book three is no different. I love the sheer variety of powers and abilities all the characters demonstrate, and it was great to see the comparison between an older and modern version of the organisation.

Bottom of the TBR: **Alice in No-Mans-Land** by *James Knapp*

This was one of the first books I put on my TBR list, and I was finally able to pick up a copy. The book was fine, the characters were great and felt very real, and the plot moved along steadily as the protagonist attempted to unravel what had happened and how to survive.

Magical Realism/Literary Fantasy: **The Book Eaters** by *Sunyi Dean*

I grabbed this on impulse purely because of the name and thought I knew what I was getting into, but this book grabs your heart and does not let go. A mother, doing whatever it takes to keep her kid alive against years and years of tradition. It was an amazing read.

Young Adult: **A Deadly Education** by *Naomi Novik*

Recommended to me, I’ve read a lot of Novik’s books but was a bit hesitant on this one. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. The characters felt real as they attempted to survive a school and their classmates trying to kill them, and the way she worked her magic system and monsters didn’t feel repetitive or imitative.

Mundane Jobs: **Terminal Alliance** by *Jim C. Hines*

Grabbed to finish off my bingo card and I ended up loving this book. The balance of humor, drama, mystery, and thriller against a sci-fi setting with alien feeling aliens is incredibly well done, and he had a great take on humans.

Published in the 00s: **Spin Control** by *Chris Moriarty*

Book 2 of the spin series was good, but it felt hard to live up to book 1. A lot more of a focus on politics and spycraft compared to the first, but it was still very enjoyable. The characters were good and the plot was great, leaning very heavy into thriller along with the sci-fi which kept you guessing about who was playing who.

Angels and Demons: **The Screwtape Letters** by *C.S. Lewis*

Another pickup to finish my bingo card, this one I was not a fan on. Not that it’s a bad book, though very dated, it just wasn’t for me. The satire was on point, and I could see the message Lewis was pushing, just wasn’t a fan.

5 SFF Short Stories: **Dragonesque** edited by *S.C. Butler and Joshua Palmatier*

This was a great anthology. A collection of short stories in a mix of sci fi and fantasy, all about dragons, by a whole variety of authors. I read a lot more short story collections over this past year, but the ones put out by Zombies Need Brains are always my favorite. If you’re looking for some short stories, I will 100% recommend checking them out.

Horror: **The Dead Take a Train** by *Cassandra Khaw and Richard Kadrey*

I didn’t know these two were collaborating until I saw the book, and it was done the same day I picked it up, I could not stop reading. Two of my favorite authors together, in a book with great characters and beautifully visceral descriptions all set against a looming eldritch horror in the city.

Weird Ecology 2022 (swapped for Self-Published/Indie Publisher) **City of Saints and Madmen** by *Jeff Vandermeer*

Vandermeer’s books are always odd, but this one actually feels a bit more grounded. Sure, there’s a question about what’s true and what isn’t, but the numbers of different viewpoints to examine the stories through was great, and the worldbuilding, at least what you could see, had an excellent balance of weird and real.

Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF: **The Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi** by *Shannon Chalraborty*

This was a lot of fun to read, the characters feeling realistic even when dealing with monsters and magics with their very human bodies. A lot of the story moved along via pirate ship, and it gave the story a very real sense of time passing as they were at the mercy of the winds and tides.

Published in 2023: **For Love of Magic** by *Simon R Green*

It wasn’t a complex book, but I always enjoy Simon R Green’s writing. It was nice to pick up one of his books that wasn’t part of a series as well. A nice mix of urban fantasy and tricks up ones sleeve as the characters attempt to survive both history and monsters.

Multiverse and Alternate Realities: **Doors of Sleep** by *Tim Pratt*

This was an interesting take on travel between alternative realities, especially without being able to control the travel. The number of unique worlds is insane, and the little flashbacks to show how the main character learned to survive however he could really added to the realism of the character.

POC Author: **The Fifth Season** by *N.K. Jemsin*

This was not an easy read, not because of the writing but the world the characters lived in and dealt with every single day, and what they had done previously. The abilities really fit in the unique world Jemsin built, and I loved the multiple viewpoints we got. It’s a great series (I picked up books 2 and 3 before finishing the first), but I can also see why it’s a bit devisive.

Book Club/Readalong Book: **Children of Time** by *Adrian Tchaikovsky*

Even after being recommended this book a ton, I ending up reading Shards of Earth first. However, after I’d devoured that one I picked up Children of Time and enjoyed it even more. The viewpoints of the nonhuman characters was great, and I loved watching them evolve as a civilization. The humans felt a bit like a minor plot instead of two parallel stories coming together, but I still loved it immensely.

Novella: **The Narrow Road Between Desires** by *Patrick Rothfuss*

I know it’s not book 3, but I enjoyed going back to Temerant, especially looking at the world through the eyes of Bast. Seeing what he does day to day was interesting, and the way he dealt with problems give me a slight Discworld Witches vibe, which I thought was great.

Mythical Beasts: **Bloody Rose** by *Nicholas Eames*

Eames didn’t pull any punches in Kings of the Wyld, and Bloody Rose kicked it up a notch. Characters who felt like people surviving more than thriving in a world of mercenaries and monsters, little tweaks to traditional fantasy monsters make the world feel more unique, and an epic conclusion, it’s an amazing book.

Elemental Magic: **Gutter Mage** by *J.S. Kelly*

This was interesting, it had a PI/detective vibe, but in a purely fantasy world. A straightforward magic system with realistic characters who aren’t necessarily good people but try their best. The plot moved along, though it felt a bit choppy occasionally in the first half, the second half felt a lot smoother.

Myths and Retellings: **How Rory Thorne Destroyed the Multiverse** by *K. Eason*

It’s hard to find a good mix of sci-fi and fantasy, but Eason did a great job of it. A whole bunch of different fairy tales mixed into a multi system space opera layered with politics, scheming and the princess using her wits to survive. I wasn’t expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, but it was a great read.

Queernorm Setting: **Record of a Spaceborn Few** by *Becky Chambers*

I love the wayfarer’s series, and this one simultaneously felt unique and fit in perfectly. Seeing this part of her universe from so many different viewpoints give the book a much more grounded feel, as did the characters struggling to make decisions. People felt like people, even years and years into the future on giant spaceships.

Coastal/Island Setting: **Mordew** by *Alex Pheby*

Mordew is an incredible book, the world is unique and there’s a great blend of fantasy and mystery. It’s not a cheerful, upbeat book but the characters are doing their best to survive using whatever they have. It’s description heavy and incredibly strange but definitely worth the read.

Druids: **The Jasmine Throne** by *Tasha Suri*

This was a great read, an Indian inspired fantasy world mixing rebellion and politics with plant magics. The characters aren’t one dimensional, nor are they necessarily purely good, but instead doing what they can to help their people survive. While we do get some good lore, the story is definitely more character driven then plot driven at times, which I felt was great.

Featuring Robots: **Mage Against the Machine** by *Shaun Barger*

Another blend of fantasy and sci-fi, it was interesting seeing two separate disparate worlds eventually colliding together. The world building is great, and the story moves you along quickly, but the characters aren’t always people you want to root for, even the protagonist.

Sequel: **The Tyrant Baru Cormorant** by *Seth Dickinson*

The third book in the series is, for me at least, near perfect. Two novels of Baru trying her best to take her revenge, and when it comes together, how she does it, makes perfect sense. The characters are great, the world is big, and I never felt like it was a slog.

1711021311.0,"Le Guin talks about the ""twist"" of LOTR's characters and themes","From the book Language of the Night:

>  Critics have been hard on Tolkien for his ""simplisticness,"" his division of the inhabitants of Middle Earth into the good people and the evil people. And indeed he does this, and his good people tend to be entirely good, though with endearing frailties, while his Orcs and other villains are altogether nasty. But all this is a judgment by daylight ethics, by conventional standards of virtue and vice. When you look at the story as a psychic journey, you see something quite different, and very strange. You see then a group of bright figures, each one with its black shadow. Against the Elves, the Orcs. Against Aragorn, the Black Rider. Against Gandalf, Saruman. And above all, against Frodo, Gollum. Against him--and with him.  
>  
>  It is truly complex, because both the figures are clearly doubled. Sam is, in part, Frodo's shadow, his ""inferior"" part. Gollum is two people, too, in a more direct, schizophrenic sense; he's always talking to himself, Slinker talking to Stinker, Sam calls it. Sam understands Gollum very well, though he won't admit it and won't accept Gollum as Frodo does, letting Gollum be their guide, trusting him. Frodo and Gollum are not only both hobbits; they are the same person--and Frodo knows it. Frodo and Sam are the bright side, Smeagol-Gollum the shadow side. In the end Sam and Smeagol, the lesser figures, drop away, and all that is left is Frodo and Gollum, at the end of the long quest. And it is Frodo the good who fails, who at the last moment claims the Ring of Power for himself; and it is Gollum the evil who achieves the quest, destroying the Ring, and himself with it. The Ring, the archetype of the Integrative Function, the creative-destructive, returns to the volcano, the eternal source of creation and destruction, the primal fire. When you look at it that way, can you call it a simple story? I suppose so. Oedipus Rex is a fairly simple story, too. But it is not simplistic. It is the kind of story that can be told only by one who has turned and faced his shadow and looked into the dark.

1711020269.0,Goose Bingo Row Three,"Yes, I did it. Rows one and two in my profile, rows four and five forthcoming. 

**Mother Goose:** Read a book about a storyteller. Despite my vow to spend no money I did purchase this for all of two dollars at the Coles charity bookstall:  **Soraya the Storyteller by Rosanne Hawke**

Honk Mode: Storyteller must be your Mum. Absolutely nobody has written a book about my mother. 

I am stretching the definition of fantasy here as 12 year old Soraya is an Afghani Asylum Seeker living in modern day Australia on a temporary protection visa, but as the title suggests Soraya processes her trauma through fantasy stories. She listens to the Afghani folk tales told to them by Khala, an older woman and fellow Afghani refugee who has moved into her house to look after her and her two younger siblings. They do still have their mother but she is still distraught over the horrors of losing her husband and three older children to the Taliban and escaping. Soraya also copes by writing stories  including one of her own family, reimagined as a fairy tale with a happy ending that Soraya herself is not guaranteed. Over the course of the story she processes her own grief and trauma while settling into Australian life with all of its good people, bad people and prejudiced people. But the fact remains she is on a temporary protection visa and could lose it all in three years. But it was a story of hope and resilience after suffering terrible darkness, and I do recommend it to adults as well as children. 

&#x200B;

**Good for the Goose, Good for the Gander:** Read a book that deals with equality. **A.J. Lancaster's A Rake of His Own.** 

Honk Mode: The book isn't set in a patriarchal society. Does 50% count? Human society is patriarchal but Fae society isn't. 

Chronologically the fifth of the Stariel books but also functions as a stand alone. This book features Rake, Prince of the Faerie Court of Ten Thousand Spires and Marius Valstar the post graduate university botanist. There was a strong attraction between the two in the quartet but they need their own volume to properly resolve it while also solving a murder involving fae magic in Marius’s university. Marius is also trying to deal with the problems of his new telepathy powers. I justified this as ‘themes of equality’ as part of the problems the lovers overcome is their two cultures, two species and two pasts. The human society frowns upon homosexuality and there are laws against it, albeit rarely enforced, which means Marius has a lot of internalized shame. Faery society does not see a difference between homosexual and heterosexual behaviour, which causes Rake a lot of confusion. Faeries cannot lie or break their word. Humans can, which makes Rake feel he is vulnerable in this pairing. Rake has had many lovers but never been in love, while Marius has only had one lover he loved which ended badly. Another interesting angle is that both Rake and Marius have experienced their siblings unexpectedly taking noble roles above them recently. Both are still adjusting to the new reality and relationships this entails. We also get more exposure to the low fae in this book, as opposed to the high fae which tend to be closer to human like Rake. Low Fae tend to be more animalistic as well as less intelligent and powerful. Rake believes it is the duty of High Fae like himself to take care of them as a way of balancing the scales between them, which he takes seriously. Recommended for romance, fantasy and murder mystery fans.

**Honk:** Featuring an Eldritch Horror bent on destroying all life. **Ben Aaronovitch's False Value.**   To avoid spoilers, I will simply state that I'll die on the hill that the eldritch horror is just that, and while it only wanted to destroy some specific life that’s probably as close as I’ll get without spending money.

Honk Mode: Not a non fiction book on geese. Um...no. Definitely not. Completely fictional. 

A good entry point for newcomers to the Rivers of London world as the major plot points of the previous ones with the Faceless Man have wrapped up and we are on to new parts of policeman Peter Grant’s life, personal and professional. Personally he continues to adjust to life as the partner of the Beverely Brook River Goddess, currently five months pregnant with his twins. Professionally he is working undercover as security at a tech billionaires place as both his recent suspension and his position at the Folly, the London polices liaison with magic and the supernatural, make him a perfect plant. The Rivers of London series is quintessential urban fantasy, magic and supernatural beings alongside the mundanity of regular police work and investigation. Aaronovitch is also a master at character voice. I heartily recommend the series to everyone, especially fans of urban fantasy and crime.

**Goosebumps:** Read a Goosebumps book or fanfiction. **R.L. Stine's Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls.** 

Honk Mode: Read the Goosebumps AO3 fanfic with the most content warnings. Nope. I wanted to wallow in childhood nostalgia, not adulthood trauma.   

I read quite a lot of Goosebumps when I was a tween. Stine doesn’t bother doing much worldbuilding and reasoning why the spooky things happen but that isn’t what he’s going for. He’s just trying to get spooky scenes and imagery out juxtaposed with the mundane problems of ordinary children (school, bullies, annoying families, crushes). I once described them to my grandmother who was asking for advice about whether some donated Goosebumps should be sold or dumped at her Christian College book sale (debate was apparently raging) that they were books for children who wanted to be scared without actually being scared. And that’s what Stine delivers. A simple prose experience for children in the changeover period between being too old for picture books but too young for adult novels. And the plot had two whole twists that I didn’t see coming a mile off. I do seem to remember the ones I read as a kid ending with life going back to normal around a lot of oblivious adults, but considering the main character’s body had burned down a house, attacked multiple family members and caused lots of property damage while being taken over by a ghoul I think they are going to have a lot of trouble going back to normal life.

**Silly Goose:** The main character is figuratively a silly goose. **Suzy Goose and the Christmas Star by Peter Horacek**

Honk Mode: The main character is literally a silly goose. Yes. 

Suzy Goose is the dumbest goose in fiction as well as the silliest. She thinks a bright star in the sky would look perfect on the Christmas tree so she decides to go get it. Even though she has wings she attempts to get this star by sliding down a hill, jumping off three progressively higher places, then walking to the point where she gets hopelessly lost so her friends have to make a huge noise to call her back home. Then when she gets there the star has naturally moved to the top of the bloody tree anyway! Illustration wise Horacek has an excellent sense of colouring and backgrounds, but I’m not as keen on his rendition of barnyard animals (apart from the expressions which are delightful). ",Fantasy
1711017072.0,What is the earliest 'modern' example of second world fantasy as we know it today?,"With modern I mean from the 17-1800's onwards, so not the Greek myths or Arthurian legends etc.

By second second world fantasy as we know it today I mean stories like Lotr, Got etc. Fully realized secondary worlds in which (often historical/medieval based) fantasy stories take place without overt reference to the real world. So no portal fantasy like Alice in Wonderland or John Carter.

The earliest example I know of the top of my head is Conan. But is Conan truly the first?

1711008566.0,Getting back into the groove with the Wizard Knight,"Hi all. A 36-year-old here, who grew up reading a ton of fantasy and sci-fi until college. I loved everything Tolkien, Eddings, and pretty much everything in the high fantasy genre. 

Then life happened and I lost interest in those genres altogether. I tried picking up GoT along the way, but couldn’t get into it. Some people recommended the Earthsea series, but I couldn’t get through the it either. Seemed like that part of my life was gone, unfortunately, since these are the books I would love as a kid, so I went over a decade and a half without completing a fantasy book. 

Fast forward to last week, I stumbled upon a random video on the Wizard Knight books by Gene Wolfe. I decided to give it a try but I didn’t have high hopes. And then, just like that, I got hooked. I’m halfway through, and this might be the best book I’ve read in a very long time. There’s something about it that I haven’t seen in a lot of books. It’s very easy to read and it flows very nicely, but you have to constantly be on the lookout for seemingly minor details and actually think to put the story together. It doesn’t do the thinking for you, but it also is not convoluted just for the mystery sake. 

I love it, and I have no idea why I haven’t seen it before. I don’t remember hearing the name of the author before, even though he’s gone already and his prime happened when I was still into the genre. 

Anyway, just wanted to let you know, that it you’re in a similar situation and you are looking to find your mojo back, pick up the Wizard Knight. 

Also, which book series of his should I pick up next?

1711003047.0,The Queen of Mean!,"Hi,

Medieval fantasy is my go-to, but I don't mind it not being fantasy. I need characters like Olenna or Cersei from GoT, Livia from Domina, or Violet from Downton Abbey. A woman who is sharp, cunning, strong. I can also accept evil.

I like stories around prostitutes and brothels, poisoning, vengeance, vile women, political intrigue, drama, a story where things happen, where men suffer. Something smart but not too difficult to get into.

Thanks :)",Fantasy
1711000705.0,"Completed Elric Saga, Original 6 Book Run","I was never a reader until my early 20s, and then I had a lot of pretentious catching up to do. It was finally in my late 20s that I got the itch for reading fantasy. I'd always been a fan of fantasy films, so it was only natural once my appreciation for reading set in.

Long story short, I'm in my late-early 30s, and I finally finished the 6 book original run of Michael Moorcock's Elric of Melnibone saga. I'm still early in my fantasy reading life, having read a few Vance, a few Wolfe, and some Donaldson, among other authors of science fiction and weird lit.

Reading Elric in my early 30s must have been much different than reading it as a kid would have been back in the 60s and 70s. While I did ""escape"" into it, due to my personal tastes, I tended to read it a bit analytically, trying to understand Moorcock through his use of tools, rather than just being off with Elric uncritically. Did it enjoy it? Absolutely. Elric's brooding and sardonic attitude, his friendship with Moonglum, the hilarity of Elric's compounding tragedies, Moorcock's balls to the wall style which, making sense for the 60s, serpentines from run of the mill fantasy to psychedelic fever dream multiversal absurdity. It's a banger, with an asterisk.

In many cases I felt that Moorcock's writing was fairly juvenile, clunky, and abrupt. His scenes jumped about often and quickly and the unpolished prose made for a sometimes jarring read, especially after having just finished the Book of the New Sun days before. In spite of that, though, I found it easy to readjust my expectations of prose and just went with the story that Moorcock was telling so exuberantly.

Some incredible scenes will stay with me for years, but many others have already faded. I recommend this series to anyone who wants quick easy reads, with very little pretentiousness.",Fantasy
1710994926.0,recommend a fun ya-ish series? ,"I need a palate cleanser series and I really haven’t been able to find anything that fits the bill. 

I want something fast paced with powerful, likable characters and a plot that is good, but doesn’t take itself too seriously

I’m fine with almost any subgenre, but I usually don’t like middle grade, humor, urban fantasy, or heavy romance. (Not that I don’t like books WITH these things, I just usually don’t like them as the major selling point of the book, if that makes sense)

1710985053.0,Review - Son of a Liche by J. Zachary Pike,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f0nqa88yclpc1.jpg?width=998&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=88c28c185269679e643d5e2d1c27cda890b2be3a

[https://beforewegoblog.com/review-son-of-a-liche-by-j-zachary-pike/](https://beforewegoblog.com/review-son-of-a-liche-by-j-zachary-pike/)

SON OF A LICHE is the sequel to the Dark Profit Saga’s first book,  ORCONOMICS. The premise of the series is that Dungeons and Dragons is  how the world is set up. Adventurers go into dungeons, grab a bunch of  loot, and kill the monsters inside. However, this has attracted venture  capitalists who wagered fortunes on this activity. This brought the dark  sides of capitalism to monster slaying and it soon became a  racism-and-murder based economy which was unsustainable since eventually  you’re going to run out of orcs to murder for their meager savings. The  satire was inspired by the 2008 housing crisis and the present novel  also brings up some elements of Donald Trump, though he’s only got a few  pot shots taken at him.

In this volume, picking up after the previous one, our protagonists  are suffering mild PTSD from the fact they witnessed the biggest and  most heinous massacre of orcs which has occurred in a century. Worse,  they were indirectly responsible for the crime and have been outlawed as  part of the Heroes’ Guild’s attempts to cover up their role in the set  up. Unfortunately, our heroes aren’t very good at trying to make up for  their mistakes. They’ve wandered around trying to find the orcs who  survived and have absolutely no luck. They do soon get an opportunity to  save the world by stopping a Liche King’s seemingly unstoppable army.  Just, there’s the slight issue they’re not actually good enough or  strong enough to do it.

The Dark Profit Saga is a unique combination of modern political and  economic satire with dramatic examination of prejudice plus gutbustingly  hilarious humor. The closest analog I can think of is Terry Pratchett’s  Discworld where, comparatively, I think it stands on equal terms.  That’s praise I don’t throw around lightly. These books are every bit as  funny as Pratchett and has just as good an amount of world-building.  The treatment of capitalism is critical but it’s not attacking the  system of making money itself but the greed as well as criminal lack of  responsibility or consequences even when they break the law.

Basically, one of the prevailing themes is the corrupt bankers and  investors behind the Heroes’ Guild are always willing to bend the rules  to their favor as long as it means more revenue for them. Whenever  there’s a problem, they blame F.O.E.S (Forces of Evil) or beat the drum  of racism against against NPCs (non-evil monsters). They even throw  their legitimate enterprise NPCs under the bus as long as it means more  for them. I’m not a big fan of Wallstreet so this kind of nasty  criticism and accusation of race baiting didn’t bother me.

I was a big fan of one plotline where a Wall(street) banker is “woke”  to the injustices of the system where the Wood Elves, local family of  Trolls, and other NPCs around him are slowly killed off. We also see how  the Orc survivors are dealing with the temptations between turning back  to the “Old Ways” for vengeance versus trying to make a fortune as  aggressive bargainers. Mind you, while the author sides strongly with  the orcs who don’t want bloody revenge, I’m not sure the ones that do  are in the wrong since the people who TRIED legitimate business were  murdered for it. Why, exactly, is going back to it a smart decision?

The section from the perspective of the undead horde is also  hilarious. The Liche is trying to figure out ways to kill everyone in  the world before adding them to his undead army. He’d very much like  them all to join his organization willingly (so he doesn’t have to fight  them). That means trying to make better pamplets as well as slogans to  persuade people to serve him. The cowardly head of the city guard who  deserted his post, only to run accidentally straight into the armies of  evil, provides an interesting perspective on the whole thing.

As for the main party, we have development in ways I didn’t expect.  Gorm the Dwarf tries to deal with the loss of his two best friends as  well as his attempts to be a hero despite being very bad at it. Their  elven ranger is addicted to salves as well as the object of affection  for a troll. The mages have to deal with the fact their forms of magic  are completely incompatible (or are they?). Plus, one of them is the  Liche King’s son. There’s even a Bard in deep debt to a magical artifact  hook that is also a crime lord.

In conclusion, SON OF A LICHE, is a great novel. It has a lot of good  character development for the protagonists, interesting twists, and  detestable villains. I personally am hoping that Johann the Paladin  eventually gets his (since he’s a terrible example of his class) but  we’ll see how that goes in the third novel. This is a truly  well-realized fantasy world with likable characters and a wide-variety  of references for people who love D&D, MMORPGs, and fantasy in  general.",Fantasy

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 

**Title with a Title:** Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb   
This isn't for me.  I can appreciate why people love it, and the world and magic were interesting.  But I just can't.  It was basically just let's shit on Fitz, and I just don't want to read that much about a poor little kid being abused and mistreated by everyone.  

**Superheroes:** Jade War by Fonda Lee   
I really liked this one.  Love how different the setting is.  The mix between Godfather and super powered kung fu was fun.  Ayt Mada is an intriguing antagonist.  Looking forward to reading the rest of this series.

**Bottom of the TBR:** Arrows of the Queen by Mercedes Lackey   
Not sure about this one really.  I liked it and I enjoyed reading it.  But it's also pretty tough for me to read (I'm a teacher, and I have a soft spot for kids who have unsupportive family.  So it was kind of heartbreaking to see how Talia suffers because I just wanted to give the poor thing a hug).  And the darker turns later in this trilogy didn't really sit well with me either, so that kind of soured me a little.

**Magical Realism or Literary Fantasy**: One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez   
So this was   .....  weird.  Haha.  I was just like wtf was that.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  I get why it's a classic.  I will definitely read more from Marquez.

**Young Adult:** Library of the Dead by TL Hutchu   
I think this is a YA book that a lot of adults who dislike YA could enjoy.  Ropa Moyo is a teenager, but she's got a lot on her plate (using her magic of speaking to the dead to deliver messages to make money to support her grandmother and little sister, taking care of them), so she's quite mature.  There's no romance (not at all).  Interesting setting (a modern, kind of post apocalyptic Edinburgh) and magic.  Ropa and her friends are sarcastic and really remind me of how teens that age actually act and joke around.  A fun, easy, quick read.  Now if only Libby would get the third book so I can finish the series.

**Mundane Jobs**: Lattes and Legends by Travis Baldree   
A rare book that is super hyped, but somehow manages to more than live up to it.  Who knew reading about the construction of a coffee shop could be so engrossing?  Haha.  I thought it was very cute and cozy.  Made me want cinnamon rolls and a iced latte real bad.

**Published in the 00s:** Stormfront by Jim Butcher   
I liked it, despite Harry's chauvinism and gross pig-ness.  (Seriously, how much did I love it in the second book when Murphy hauled off and punched him?  Haha.  So well deserved.)  I like Chicago, magic, and a good detective story.  It was entertaining.  And bonus points for the audiobook.  I don't normally enjoy them, but these are good.  (And they make laugh when it gets to the ""please insert CD 2"" parts.)

**Angels and Demons:** Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman   
Freaking loved it.  Never have I laughed my ass off so much reading a book (well until I met Uzi Jesus -- iykyk).  It was just hysterical and delightful.  My first book for both these authors.  I've been enjoying Gaiman a lot, and I am looking forward to more Pratchett.

**Five SFF Short Stories:** The Witcher short stories (Last Wish and Sword of Destiny) by Andrzej Sapkowski   
So good.  I like the Eastern European setting and monsters.  Grumpy old timer with a secret soft spot is one of my favorite character types.  Bought the main series on sale super cheap for Cyber Monday and am kind of looking forward to them and kind of sad because I know it won't be as much Geralt and Ciri as I want.

**Horror:** My Best Friend's Exorcism by Grady Hendrix   
Not normally that into horror, but this one isn't bad at all.  As an 80's baby, I love the nostalgia.  Like how humorous it is.  The creepy bits weren't as creepy as his other book (Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires) I read was though.

**Self-Published OR Indie Publisher:** Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Diniman   
I did not expect this one.  I thought it was be fun, popcorn type book.  But oh man.  I loved it.  It constantly made me like snort laugh and ask ""what the fuck?"" outloud (much to the confusion of the cats).  I enjoyed the video game like vibes.  Carl is a likeable protagonist and it's so easy to root for him.  And all hail Princess Donut.  It also will unexpectedly hit you in the feels from time to time.  I tore through the series in a few weeks and loved every minute of it.

**Set in the Middle East/Middle Eastern SFF:** The Master of Djinn by P Djeli Clark   
Fun setting, a sort of early 1900s steampunky Cairo.  I like Agents Fatimah (gotta respect a woman who rocks an excellent suit lol) and Hadia.  Liked the mystery aspect.  

**Published in 2023:** The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi by Shannon Chakraborty   
Love it.  Love it so much.  Such a fun adventure.  Amina is awesome and badass.  It's nice to see a mother character and a Muslim.  There's pirates.  I actually squealed at that reveal at the end.  Lol.  I highly recommend this book.

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities:** The Golden Compass by Phillip Pullman   
I had watched most of the series, so I knew the story before reading, but I was really impressed with how good this book is.  It's just so well written.  I love Lyra, the little Queen of Bullshitting.  Love the sort of sense of wonder and fun we get from running around Jordan with her.  I am really looking forward to continuing on with this series.

**POC Author:** Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler   
I really enjoyed this one.  Could do without the Earthseed aspect, but other than that.  It's so great.  Of all the dystopian books, I really think one is the most realistic, like it got the most right about how we're messing society up and ruining everything.  (The bookclub I'm in just discussed this one tonight, and in a couple months we're going to read Parable of the Talents and I am so here for it.)

**Book Club OR Readalong Book**: A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula LeGuin   
Another great one.  My only complaint is that it's so short.  I would gladly read a version of this book that is double the length.  Haha.  Definitely a classic for a reason.  (Also, why does my library's Libby suck and not have the rest of the series?)

**Novella:** A Secret History by Brandon Sanderson   
Maybe I need to read more of the Cosmere to fully enjoy this one?  I like Kelsier and his inability to accept his death was an interesting read.  But then the ending went cheesy.  It was ok.

**Mythical Beasts**: Fire and Blood by George RR Martin   
This was far more entertaining than I expected.  I expected a fake historical account as written by the maesters to be dry as heck, but I found it interesting.  Is it the dragons?  Is it that the Targaryeans bring the drama?  Is it all the shade thrown at poor Mushroom the fool?  I'm not sure, but it was interesting.

**Elemental Magic**: Was planning to use Spinning Silver, but then realized ice magic didn't really count, so last minute substitution from a previous card.    
Set in Asia: The Last Phi Hunter by Salinee Goldenberg   
I really enjoyed this one.  It's part Witcher, but with Thai inspired setting and folklore and interesting creepy spirits and karma.  Ex is fun, with his smart ass ways.  It's not that I disliked Arinya, it's just you never really get a read on her and what she wants.  Their banter is fun.  It's a very unique and interesting story, and if you like angry spirits, Asian inspiration, or smartassery you should check it out.

**Myths and Retellings:** The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden   
I was really thinking I would like this.  I ended up randomly taking a Russian Fairy Tales class in college because it was the only thing available at times I could do that had open seats and ended up really liking it.  I was excited to read a book with domovoi and bannik and whatnot.  But I ended up not liking this one as much as I had been hoping.  I'm not really sure why.  (Seriously, if you know why, please tell me because it's bugging me that I can't really point to anything I disliked about it yet I still didn't really like the book.)

**Queernorm Setting:** Godkiller by Hannah Kaner   
Another one I really liked.  The world and the wild gods and their civil war are interesting.  Of course I was going to love Kissen, the crank with a secret soft spot for the kid she's taken in.  I also liked Elo, and the quest the three of them set out on.  I liked how everyone was queer and nobody cared.  I thought Kissen's disability and her roomie's deafness and how they were also treated as just a thing and totally normal were well done as well.  If I have any notes, it's that it got a bit cheesy, but overall really liked it and am looking forward to the next book.

**Coastal or Island Setting:** Red Seas Under Skies by Scott Lynch   
Yet another new favorite series I read this past year.  Love the bromance and the banter.  Love the cons.  Love the alternating flashbacks and present and how much it annoyed me that just when it was about to get good it'd switch and I'd have to wait to see what happened.  Haha.  Don't forget your cats.

**Druids:** This Poison Heart by Kalynn Bayron   
Literal Black Girl Magic, cute loving moms, botany, weird kind of spooky old estate .... what's not to like?  The MC is a likeable, realistic teenage girl, and her and her moms are just such a cute loving little family.  I am bummed my library doesn't have the sequel, because I want to see what happens.

**Featuring Robots**: All Systems Red by Martha Wells   
Everybody was raving about Murderbot Diaries, so while I don't typically enjoy anything robots in space, I gave the series and shot and I am SO glad I did.  Because I freaking love Murderbot.  Its desire to just be left alone with its media, its not knowing how to deal or be around people, but it's real attachment and ""I will do anything for you"" once it decides you are its human .... ugh just so good.  So relatable.  So funny with the sarcastic inner commentary.  And the audibooks are topnotch.  The narrator does an amazing job letting Murderbot's snark shine.

**Sequel**: The Magician King by Lev Grossman   
The Magicians trilogy isn't for everyone, but as a depressed, anxiety-riddled, millennial former gifted kid .... yeah.  I relate.  Haha.  I liked seeing more of Fillory and the safehouses were interesting (though man poor Julia).  ",Fantasy

1710974897.0,Who would be considered the most popular fantasy writers of the last decade? ,"Reason for this question is, lately I’ve been binge watching live fantasy writer panels on YouTube. One the videos I came across was an old comic con fantasy panel, it was from about 10 years ago and it consisted of Brandon Sanderson, joe Abercrombie, George RR Martin, Patrick Rothuss, robin hobb and a couple others. It was a great watch.  

To me that was something of a golden generation of writers all releasing books around the same time and seemed semi famous to non fantasy book readers too. Is there a comparison of a set of newer authors today who could rival them? Or are those guys still considered to be the top fantasy writers? ",Fantasy
1710970062.0,Road Trip recommendation,"We are heading on a roadtrip and would love some recommendations (we will be listening to audiobooks). *There will be 2 young kids in the car who may hear some occasionally, so nothing too graphic.  But they will have headphones on or be napping when we listen*

I am into most fantasy, especially grim dark atm.  My wife loves standard fantasy romance, which I am generally not partial to, but I don’t mind ones that have interesting storylines without getting bogged down in romance.  I didn’t hate The Fourth Wing and just finished Divine Rivals and thought it was interesting.  We also enjoy thrillers, even if they get a bit dark.

She has read most of the hot current series, Sarah Maas and such.  So if anyone can recommend us something that can appeal a bit to both of us, that would be amazing.  Relatively short would be helpful to, just so we can try to finish it.  Thanks!",Fantasy
1710968751.0,2023 Book Bingo with Spoiler-free Reviews ,"This is my first year completing the book bingo.  I completed the whole card in hard mode.

5/5 stars = favorites
4/5 stars = very good
3/5 stars = don't want a sequel
2/5 stars = didn't like it
1/5 stars = too boring to put on bingo card

Title with a Title (HM): Sheepfarmer's Daughter by Elizabeth Moon (3/5 stars). This book, published in 1988, is too full of well-established boring tropes. I kept waiting for something more interesting to happen through all the military training and battles. I appreciated the representation of an asexual woman in a male-dominated environment.  However, the plot wasn't too interesting to me otherwise. 

Superheroes (HM): Vicious by V.E. Schwab (3/5 stars). I found the story interesting, but I didn't like most of the characters. I'm sure that I wasn't supposed to like them, but I found it a bit hard to be invested in the outcome for characters I strongly dislike.

Bottom of TBR: Sisters of the Vast Black by Lina Rather (4/5 stars). This book has many cool elements: nuns, space travel, living ships, and space politics. 

Magical Realism (HM): The Alchemist by Paulo Cuelho (2/5 stars). I had heard extremely mixed reviews for this book and unfortunately I have to side with those who didn't like it. The main character did not have a name and was just called ""the boy"" the entire time. It was extremely preachy and I didn't agree with what it was preaching: that you should rely on fate and intuition to guide your life (i.e. rolling dice to make decisions).

YA (HM): Defiant by Brandon Sanderson (5/5 stars). I love Sanderson's books so much. His plot, characters, and world-building are always excellent. This was a good conclusion to the Skyward series. So many cool things happened that I won't mention because spoilers.

Mundane Jobs (HM): A Closed and Common Orbit by Becky Chambers (5/5 stars). This is the second book in Becky Chambers' Wayfarers series. All of the books in the series have only tangential connections to each other and have different main characters. I still recommend reading A Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet first, because A Closed and Common Orbit will spoil the ending of the first book. The main characters in A Closed and Common Orbit are a mechanic and her apprentice. Most sci-fi I read focuses on big things, such large scale changes in political systems or discovery of new planets. The Wayfarers series is unique in that it only focuses on small things: the lives of individuals. Their lives sometimes have implications for the broader galaxy, but the plot is always most interested in personal development and relationships. Becky Chambers is my new favorite author. Her books always feel like a calming breath of fresh air while still being extremely interesting. 

Published in the 00s (HM): His Majesty's Dragon by Naomi Novik (5/5 stars). I loved this book so much that I went on to read the rest of the nine book series. The series explores an alternative history where the only thing different from our world is there are real dragons. I hesitated to start this series because I thought the setting of the Napoleonic wars would be boring. I was very wrong. Lawrence’s old British manners and way of thinking is actually quite an interesting part of his character. The deep friendship between man and dragon developed throughout the series is so wonderful. 

Angels and Demons (HM): Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, (5/5 stars). This book is a masterpiece. I watched the Amazon Prime adaptation before reading the book, so I will compare them. The adaptation is very close to the book, even quoting many lines directly. In the show, Michael Sheen and David Tennant improved upon the excellent dynamic between the angel and the demon. However, the child actors didn't quite capture the humor of their parts of the book, so I appreciated reading their sections. The four horsemen of the apocalypse had more development in the book through several bone-chilling anecdotes that felt too close to the real world. 

Short Stories (HM): How long 'til black future month? by N.K. Jemisin (4/5 stars). N.K. Jemisin is such an excellent author. I liked some stories better than others. I'm not a big fan of ""The City Born Great"" or the book she wrote based on it, because I don't know much about New York City. ""L'Alchimista"" was my favorite story.  It's about a mysterious stranger that challenges an Italian chef to make a strange recipe. ""Sinners, Saints, Dragons, and Haints, in the City Beneath the Still Waters”and ""The Trojan Girl"" also captured my imagination.

Horror (HM): What Moves the Dead by T. Kingfisher (4/5 stars). I'm not normally a fan of horror, but I enjoyed this book. What Moves the Dead is a re-telling of The Fall of the House of Usher. The edge-of-your-seat horror tension is nicely interwoven with humor to release the tension. I just found out that there's a new sequel, so I'm excited to check that out.

Indie publisher (HM): Central Station by Lavie Tidhar (2/5 stars). Central Station was published by Tachyon Publications, which has done an AMA with r/fantasy. This book was really weird. It had some very cool worldbuilding ideas but no overarching plot. I kept thinking all the story threads would come together in a satisfying way, but they did not.

Set in the Middle East (HM): The Stardust Thief by Chelsea Abdullah (4/5 stars). This book reminded me of The City of Brass, because both are excellent Middle Eastern fantasy with djinn, magic, and desert sands. I can't wait for the sequel to come out.

Published in 2023 (HM): The Deep Sky by Yume Kitasei (4/5 stars). I didn't have high expectations for this book, because it is about a bunch of pregnant young people on a spaceship. Despite my initial skepticism, I was convinced that it makes sense to have all the astronauts be pregnant on a long journey so they can raise the children for a few years before reaching the new colony planet. Because of this, most of the characters are cis women or nonbinary. The plot is like a murder mystery mixed with Among Us. I loved meeting all the characters and guessing whodunit. The book also explored augmented reality and long space voyages in interesting ways. It was an excellent debut novel.

Multiverse (HM): The Hexologists by Josiah Bancroft (4/5 stars). The Hexologists wasn't quite as good as Senlin Ascends by Bancroft, but it was still a fun book. There are many different kinds of magic users who have completely different abilities and ways of using magic. It fits the multiverse square because of different planes of existence they can enter and pull things from. 

POC Author (HM): Adulthood Rites by Octavia Butler (4/5 stars). Usually when I read novels written in the 80s, they feel dated by using cliches I have seen too many times (i.e. Sheepfarmer's Daughter) or sexism (i.e. The Eye of the World). This is not at all the case for Octavia Butler's work. Adulthood Rites is the second book in the trilogy that starts with the novel Dawn. It was fascinating and horrifying in equal measures. It explores ideas of consent, power dynamics, and what it means to be human through a creative and interesting alien race. I would have given it five stars, but it had too many (intentionally) unsettling sections to be in my top favorites.

Book Club Book (HM):
Ink Blood Sister Scribe by Emma Torzs (5/5 stars). I read this book with the Feminism in Fantasy book club. It is Emma Torzs' first published novel. My favorite part was the book-centered magic, which had excellent vibes. The mysteries were intriguing and I was pretty proud of myself for predicting the final twist. I'm not sure if there's going to be a sequel, but I was sad to be done reading it. 

Novella (HM): The Annual Migration of Clouds by Premee Mohamed (2/5 stars). This book is a depressing post-apocalyptic novella. The main character not only lives under difficult circumstances, but also has a serious parasite that affects her nervous system. There were a few excellent scenes in this novella related to the parasite, but I didn't enjoy the main university decision-making plot.

Mythical Beasts (HM): Untethered Sky by Fonda Lee (4/5 stars). I chose to read this because I absolutely loved Fonda Lee's Green Bone saga. Untethered Sky is about a young woman's relationship with a roc, an enormous mythical bird. It was fascinating to read the main character's journey of training a roc to kill manticores.

Elemental magic (HM): The Eye of the World by Robert Jordan (3/5 stars). The characters' journeys, the setting, and the plot drew me in and took me on an adventure. However, the way Robert Jordan writes women was very irritating. All of the women in the book are ""bossy"". If a man makes leadership decisions and the woman follows, that's treated as a relief. If a woman makes leadership decisions, the men around her think she is super bratty and annoying. The exception is the powerful sorceress Moraine who is treated as extremely dangerous. It seems that the men don't trust her primarily because she's a woman with power. I have the unpopular opinion that the Amazon Prime show (which I watched first) is much better. It doesn't have the same problems with portraying women and Moiraine is awesome in the show. I'm very excited for season three whenever that comes out.

Myths and Retellings (HM): Kaikeyi by Vaishnavi Patel (5/5 stars). This is an excellent feminist retelling of the Ramayana (a significant Hindu story) with a focus on Kaikeyi, the queen who exiles the prince Ram. 

Queernorm (HM): The Bone Shard Daughter by Andrea Stewart (5/5 stars). This book was excellent and I can't wait to read what happens next in the sequel. It takes place in an empire composed of islands that float around in the sea and administered by bone shard magic. It follows three separate characters on different islands. One POV is a noble daughter who is in love with a commoner woman. Their subplot definitely proved that it's possible to write a decent gay romantic plot without resorting to societal homophobia as one of the obstacles to romance. The other two main POVs are a smuggler and a princess and both of their stories were truly amazing.

Coastal or Island Setting (HM): The Traitor Baru Cormorant (3/5 stars). I found the major plot twists in this book very predictable and I hated them. I'm still giving it three stars because the premise was great and the characters were compelling.

Druids (HM): The Jasmine Throne by Tasha Suri, (5/5 stars). The Jasmine Throne is wonderful. The druid magic feels both dangerous and beautiful, capturing the power of nature. I loved Priya and her development through the story. All the characters are great and some of them are such excellent foils of each other. 

Featuring Robots (HM): All Systems Red by Martha Wells (5/5 stars). This book was so good I quickly went on to read the rest of the series. The perspective of a cyborg security unit who loves TV dramas was such a joy. The security unit (named Murderbot) has an unique voice and is a nuanced character. It is one of the best series I have read. 

Sequel (HM): Lightbringer by Pierce Brown (5/5 stars). Lightbringer is the sixth book in the Red Rising series. This series wins my award for most plot twists. All of the books are such page-turners and I can't stop reading them. So excited for the final book whenever that comes out.

1710968620.0,Stories about fantasy characters finding themselves in the future?,"Hello, first post on this sub, hope I'm doing this right.

I'm looking for stories with a focus on culture shock between characters from a more typical fantasy setting (medieval or otherwise) and the future of their world. The actual method doesn't matter (time travel, a mummy awakening centuries later, etc.), but I'm specifically looking for someone discovering *their* future, not another world with a different level of technology.

Outside of literature exemples that come to mind are *Gargoyles*, *Samurai Jack*, *Fate/Stay Night* and derivatives. Stories about immortal characters like *Highlander* are also close in spirit. But all of these are based on a fantasy-ish version of Earth - they fit the bill, but I wonder if any story has the same scenario happen in a fully constructed world, like Middle-earth and such. I think a world like that changing could be pretty entertaining: a high fantasy village becoming an urban fantasy metropolis, the Dark Lord's fortress becoming a tourist spot, etc.",Fantasy
1710968127.0,Books similar to Tangled?,Tangled os one of my favourite movies and I would love to read a fantasy or sci-fi where the characters are similar to them or just the vibes of a lost princess of a kingdom.,Fantasy
1710966516.0,I hate how every character ever is super weak to enemies that mimic/transform loved ones.,"I'm listening to The Poppy Wars right now and there is a demon called a Chi-Mae (spell check, audiobook, so unsure of actual spelling) that puts on the face and voice of a loved one and pretends to be them while it tries to kill you. The characters assigned to kill this demon ended up massively struggling as it proceeded to mimic their loved ones and do the typical psychological torture we've all read about and seen. EDIT: to be clear, the characters assigned to kill this demon know it's a chi-mae and about its abilities. they weren't ambushed by this totally unsuspectingly. the scenario was: >!""hey, there's a chi-mae around the corner. are there any soldiers willing to volunteer to go kill it? and the MC says, ""i volunteer, i've read about them and know how to kill it."" and then promptly struggles with it massively.!<

There's also the mockingbirds in the second Hunger Games movie/book that mimics the voices of the main cohort's various loved ones and puts them all into a mental spiral.

And there are probably many, many examples of this trope throughout all sorts of fantasy stories. In my memory, I swear these monsters are always so highly effective. I wish we could see a highly logical and pragmatic character who, when confronting a monster/demon/robot that is known to put on the face and voice of a loved one and will try to psychologically torture you, can pragmatically assess the situation and proceed with dealing with the monster without spiraling into some deep, dark place. I'm not saying that they have to be totally emotionless about it. Like they can be disturbed by the creature, but still understand it's CLEARLY not their mom that passed away a decade ago, or their wife that's on the other side of the continent, or their little sister who's off in district 12 or whatever, and just handle it.

Does anyone recall any instance of that happening?

I was wondering if you guys have any book recommendations. I'm looking for a book/series which has a (preferably female) protagonist that isn't the chosen one/super overpowered. 

I've come to realize that a lot of fantasy books I've been reading recently feature a protagonist who possess some abilities that surpasses most others/what's the norm, and I'm pretty sick of that. Yes, it makes for an interesting story and it gives a reason why the protagonist becomes involved in the story, but I'm looking for a novel which features a more ""normal"" protagonist/someone who is at the position they are because of hard work and not because they just happen to be born with some random ability that others don't have and are  powerful beyond everyone else, etc etc. (I think you know what I mean).

1710950220.0,Short Fiction Book Club: Hugo Finalists That Should Have Been,"#Short Fiction Book Club: Hugo Finalists That Should Have Been

Welcome, regular participants and newcomers alike, to another edition of Short Fiction Book Club.

As many of you know, there’s been some turmoil over the [2023 Hugo Awards](https://corabuhlert.com/2024/02/15/the-2023-hugo-nomination-scandal-gets-worse/). Someday we’ll get a book about this situation, but we know that some works were declared ineligible without good reason. We have also seen compelling evidence that many ballots were thrown out, resulting in a host of works—mostly written in Chinese—dropping off the shortlist. We wanted to shine a light on these stories, and so we are hosting a session to discuss a few.


For our Short Fiction Book Club sessions, we try to select stories that have been made available to read for free online by their writers or publishers. This allows anyone who is interested to hop into a discussion session without needing to purchase a magazine issue or print anthology.

With that in mind, we have selected two Chinese-language novelettes that have been published in translation in Clarkesworld that we are discussing today:


- [Hummingbird, Resting on Honeysuckles](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/yang_11_22/) by Yang Wanqing, translated by Jay Zhang (8510 words)


- [Upstart](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/lu_12_22/) by Lu Ban, translated by Blake Stone-Banks (15820 words)


If you are interested in reading more of the Chinese works that ultimately did not appear on the officially-published Hugo shortlist—which we highly encourage!—one great option is the English translation of [Galaxy Awards 1: Chinese Science Fiction Anthology](https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Awards-Chinese-Science-Anthology/dp/8832077728). It features two works that were omitted from the short story category (“Tongji Bridge” by Lu Hang & “Fagong Temple Pagoda” by Hai Ya) and two omitted works in the novelette category (“Turing Food Court” by Wang Nuonuo & “Upstart” by Lu Ban), as well as several other stories from the vast Chinese speculative fiction scene.

1710942481.0,Goose Bingo Row Two,"I decided to do goose bingo. Here is row two. Row one can be found in my profile. I will be posting the last three over the next three days.  

&#x200B;

**Untitled**: Read a book that does not have a title. For this I went to AO3 and looked up finished works called Untitled and picked one randomly. I have decided not to link it or reveal the author as it was terrible. 

Honk Mode: But it does have a bill. Nobody in this book was called Bill, alas. 

At first I thought I just wasn’t vibing with this because I was having trouble relating to the main character who was young and did nothing but go to parties with her found family friends while taking drugs and being a lesbian. Then as it went on it was like a checklist of a Mary Sue character with trauma background. Absent homophobic father, Mother died in car accident aged 13, could have been a professional fighter but didn’t because she got gang raped aged 17 by the high school football team, adopted out the child that resulted from this, got left at the altar on her wedding day when her fiancée revealed she was cheating. Quite an eventful life for a 23 year old, or perhaps 20 year old. Her age changes, as did the name of her love interest. I don’t think this was proofed. Even though it was listed as finished it clearly wasn’t and was just going to be a predictable love story, starting In Media Res with her ex she still loves turning up at a party, going through meeting love interest, having sex and moving in with love interest within 36 hours (how convenient her father chose to be a monster at that point), having everything perfect, having doubts about love interest’s past and choices and then mercifully it stopped. I hated it and want to forget all about it. I hate whoever came up with this square for putting this piece of work in my path. I hate Book Bingo, Untitled Goose Game and April Fools Day for causing the square to exist because it means I didn’t stay in blissful ignorance. 

&#x200B;

**Got Your Goose:** Read a book in which a goose is adopted into a non-goose family. **Shannon Hale's The Goose Girl.**   I justified it as Ari lets one of the geese (Jok) and then later its mate sleep in her bed each night and her fiance is not thrilled to hear she plans to keep this up in their marriage bed.  

Honk Mode: The Goose does not know it is adopted. I'm pretty sure Jok knows he's a goose. 

This is a pretty exact retelling of the Grimm Fairy tale. Hale took all the more fantastical aspects of the story and made them reasonable. The maid who took the Princess’s place so easily with the power of people speaking, a power that makes you convincing, and the Princess Ari and titular Goose Girl have the power of beast speaking and acquiring the power of nature speaking (specifically wind) over the book. You have her needing to hide her yellow hair so she is not murdered by the maid who has taken her place and the loyal guards. Yellow hair marks her out as a foreigner in this country. Ari herself is a gratifying protagonist, starting off struggling with her duty and expectations, devastated and resigned to having them taken from her when a marriage is arranged and then having to quite literally struggle to survive when she is betrayed and unsure of how to safely reclaim what is hers. The months she lives as a goose girl help her see her own worth, the worth of allies, her inner strength and become not only resigned her to her marital fate in a foreign country but make her actually want to be Queen of this land so she can right the injustices she sees for the marginalized people. It’s a wonderful story in and of itself and a wonderful retelling, mostly for the journey of the protagonist from helplessness to strength.  

&#x200B;

**Wild Goose Chase:** Read a book that includes a wild goose chase. **Adrian Tchiakovsky's Children of Memory.** 

Honk Mode: Read a book that you thought included a wild goose chase but didn't. Nope. I was trying to do regular book bingo this year as well. I'm not reading a bunch of books hoping they don't have what I think they have in them. My time is finite.   

Okay, let’s get the obvious out the way. No, the third in the children of time series isn’t as good as the second book, and neither are as good as the first. But at the same time, I’m not sure it is fair to say that as all three books were trying to do very different things. Book one was the examination of two societies evolving and going through crises as they led to an inevitable confrontation. Book two was more of a thriller and mystery showing why the octopus society was reacting the way it was to first contact with Humans and Portiids with flashbacks to the evolution and crises their society experienced. Book three is a meditation on the nature of sentience in organic and artificial life. But it is a long time before you figure that out because it starts out as if it is examining the first contact of another society of humans who had to build their society from the ground up then partway through gets very odd. I won’t say what the wild goose chase is because of spoilers but if you’ve read it, you probably know what I’m getting at. I recommended fans of book one to read book two because I thought it was worth it. I am not sure whether or not to recommend this book because depending on your opinions of certain tropes the ending may completely ruin the whole thing for you. It didn’t for me but I can’t blame you if it did. I’ll probably read it again purely for the uplifted ravens. They were a complete delight. 

&#x200B;

**Golden Eggs:** Read book about economic systems and structures in geese society.   **The Goose that Laid a Rotten Egg by Steve Foxe. Illustrated by Fern Cano**

Honk Mode: The book also features economic systems in bull or bear societies. Oh, fuck off. 

A retelling of Aesop’s The Goose that Laid the Golden Eggs for children in graphic novel form, so it deviates from the original in that it is also a story about the importance of kindness. It also has actual named characters: the rich and selfish Worthington family, their unhappy but kind niece Valeria and a flatulent goose named Petunia she helps after it is injured by her cousin’s drone. When the family find out the goose is laying golden eggs they promptly try to force it to produce more but all Petunia manages to produce is rotten stinking eggs. Because it is for children, Petunia lives. It was a fun little romp with gorgeous illustrations by Fern Cano. The comic highlight for adults was the sequence in which the Worthington’s bring in ‘professionals’ to help Petunia start laying golden eggs instead of rotten ones with no success. Petunia didn’t think much of lifestyle coaches, yoga, chakra alignment, VR simulations or sumptuous food. 

&#x200B;

**Your Goose is Cooked:** Read a cookbook that primarily (50% or more) focuses on geese. Well, no cooking geese but it is a fantasy that primarily focuses on cooking. **Otherworldly Izakaya Nobu volumes 1-10. Original story by Natsuya Semikawa. Manga by Virginia Nitouhei**

Honk Mode: Eat Goose while you read it. Nope, too stingy to spend money on Goose Bingo, too lazy to find a shop that sells goose, too scared of my mother yelling at me for getting goose fat on her manga. 

Frustratingly, they stopped translating this one so it isn’t complete. But it’s episodic and low stakes enough that it doesn’t matter too much. I’m glad to have read it. Two Japanese chefs discovered a portal to a fantasy Germanic city, so naturally they decide the best thing to do is open a pub to introduce people to all the delights of Japanese cuisine. The emphasis on food in this one is enormous. Entire pages are devoted to people eating and enjoying food. While there are plots (mostly driven around food, both the preparation and acquiring of ingredients) it’s a mostly character driven story as the city has a wide variety of characters whose lives are improved in ways both small and large as well as emotionally and economically by eating at this pub. Recommended for those who like low stakes and cozy fantasy, especially those who thought Travis Baldree’s Legends and Lattes had too much action and romance in it. ",Fantasy

# [On Lavender Tides](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60548122) by Travis M Riddle

>  
>When  his best friend Alani, an initiate at the local Church, is sent on a  pilgrimage to find her path in life and the god she will follow, Balt  sees the perfect opportunity to launch his career by escorting her  across the archipelago and its purple seas.

1710936577.0,Hard Mode Bingo 2023 completed!,"This is my 3rd time doing an all HM bingo. One additional constraint I placed on myself was to only read books by authors I had never read before. It was again a wonderful experience as I managed to read 25 books that I would probably not have read otherwise. Mini reviews follow

**1st row**

**Title w/a Title - Rosemary Kirstein’s The Steerswoman (4\*)** is a highly unusual intellectual and entertaining book.

It takes a fundamental trope - hoarding knowledge for power and leverage - and inverts it. Steerswomen share knowledge freely with whoever asks them and they roam the world to gather, organise, share and disseminate the knowledge. The Steerswoman is a deliberately paced book that relies on an appreciation of intellectual rigour, logical analysis and deduction, honesty and open mindedness.

**Superheroes - Daniel O’Malley’s The Rook (5\*)** was an absolute blast from start to finish.

A woman wakes up in the rain with no memory and dead men littered around her in the park. And that sets up an incredible story.

The Rook has it all - superpowered agents, secret occult government agencies, depraved scientists and a rogues gallery full of interesting characters. But the overall story, the humour and wit, the inventive superpowers and their demonstrations, the tight yet absolutely bonkers plot, the batshit crazy villains, characters you root for and a gradual but definitive progressive escalation of stakes and plot makes this a winner.

**Bottom of the TBR -** What a debut! **Anthony Ryan’s Blood Song (5\*)** is an absolute triumph!

This book has everything - band of brothers, warrior school and training montage, politics, war and combat, romance and some wonderful characters. Vaelin al Sorna is unforgettable MC!

Blood Song is one of those books you encounter from time to time which leave you begging for “one chapter more”. Grips you from the first page and does not let you go.

**Magical Realism - Helene Wecker’s The Golem and the Jinni (4\*)** is a wonderful book.

First of all, the book is a great piece of magical realism - both the golem and the jinni are superb characters! Their learning curve, discovering their strengths and weaknesses, dealing with their frustrations, learning to trust humans and each other is all very believable.

Overall, a masterpiece of character and world building providing beautiful glimpses into Jewish, Middle Eastern cultures and 19th century New York.

**Young Adult -** Sweet palate cleanser! **T Kingfisher’s A Wizard’s Guide to Defensive Baking (3.5\*)** is a story of a teenage baker, Mona, who finds that she can save the city with her sourdough starter and her baking skills.

**2nd Row**

**Mundane Jobs - Elijah Kinch Spector’s Kalyna the Soothsayer (4\*)** is an enjoyable and engrossing debut.

Its a fun ride from start to finish with impressive world building and great character work.

Special mention to Kalyna’s grandmother - a foul mouthed, unadulterated arsehole with absolutely no redeeming qualities at all. I’ve not seen such a vile yet fun character in my readings so far.

The book truly shines with regards to the plot and pacing. As the story is told from the perspective of Kalyna, we know only as much as she does - as her influence and intrigues increase, the world expands. Its quite nicely done.

Overall, and enjoyable romp starring a young con artist to prevent a catastrophe she has no clue about to begin with.

**Published in the 00s - Prem Panicker's Bhimsen (5\*)** is a superb translation of **MT Vasudevan Nair’s opus Randamoozham**. It is a retailing of the Mahabharata from the point of view of Bhima. This novel manages to humanise and show Bhima in a different light. We very familiar with the with the cliche of “gadadhari” Bhima but this novel shows another (neglected imo) aspect of Bhima - the heir apparent to Yudhishtira.

Bhimsen shows the Bhima who was always in the shadows of his elder brother, the one who would be king and his younger more dashing brother. Here we see an individual who is just as intelligent, smart, proficient and perhaps possesses more empathy than all his brothers combined, just that his qualities were all overlooked and he was stereotyped as a gluttonous oaf.

A masterpiece!

**Angels/Demons -** Absolutely enjoyed **Olivia Atwater’s Small Miracles (5\*)**.

The story is whimsical and witty, warm and fuzzy, yet packs an emotional punch - dealing with grief and loss, desires and temptations.

Its a great change of pace from the usual end of the world cataclysms, wars-to-end-all-wars, armageddons or generally any eldritch horrors etc. The stakes are small, personal and entirely human - and I loved it.

I can see why it won the SFPBO comp - its generally a excellent read with almost no faults.

**Short Stories - Lord Dunsany’s Gods, Men and Ghosts (3.5\*)** is a largely good, but uneven collection of his short stories.

Split into multiple sections, I enjoyed the Jorkens stories the most - a blowhard narrating tales in a tavern about his bumbling encounters with the occult and mysterious. I can see how it influenced Clarke’s Tales of the White Hart and other authors as well.

The turn-of-the-century English is charming and a bit tedious in equal measure.

All in all, a collection that showcases Lord Dunsany’s fertile imagination.

**Horror - Patrick Suskind’s The Perfume (5\*)** is an absolute masterpiece! John Woods’ translation is amazing too.

Fair warning - Superlatives ahead…

Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is such an unforgettable character! He’s obviously not normal - physically or mentally, but to build such an obviously brilliant novel and the plot looking from over his shoulders is on another level. To make us sympathise and root for such an obvious malcontent is a stupendous achievement!

Jean-Baptiste is an Parisian orphan with an exceptional sense of smell and one evening he encounters the ultimate scent - of a virgin. He finds his life goal - to distill the scent of a virgin. His pursuit takes him from the odours and effluvia of the tanneries to the finest perfumer in Paris, from a hermetic existence in the heart of the mountain to the courts of the nobility and the heart of the perfume production in France - Grasse, where he finds the perfect quarry for his ultimate creation.

The climax, when it arrives, is so visceral, abrupt and staggering in it’s impact, I was breathless for a few moments after reading it.

The translation from the original German text is excellent (not that I’ve read the original German text).

All in all, a masterpiece!

**3rd Row**

**Self Published - Sterling Carmichael's Embers Rising (4\*)** is an excellent debut about a band of mercenaries reuniting after encountering evidence that their last job together was a plot setup by a ruthless politician to further his own selfish motives.

Most pleasing aspect was that it is the story of competant people doing things they are good at methodically - there is very little relying on luck, fortune or deus ex machina - just plain graft, consistency, application and not being flashy. The planning, the setup and the execution of their plan is a joy to watch - the stakeouts, the spying, the workouts, the R&D - everything! They are not super powered or god kissed and do everything the way it is meant to be done - carefully and without any shortcuts.

An excellent and engrossing start to the series. I will be keeping an eye open for the sequels.

**Middle East - Naguib Mahfouz’s Arabian Nights and Days (3\*)** is an interesting take on medieval Arabia and tries to portray what the life of a ideal follower of the path should be like. While the book has interesting ideas about beliefs, the correct path and way of living, morals, values, it falls short in execution

I had high hopes given Mahfouz is Africa’s first Nobel Laureate in Literature (iirc), but this introduction to his works was disappointing.

**Published in 2023 - Hannah Kaner’s Godkiller (4\*)** is an engaging debut full of heart.

Kaner has built a wonderful world where disabilities can be overcome and queer relationships are normal. The dialog is fast and snappy and the banter is charming. The plot and story move at a fast clip.

While the book has been favourably compared to Andrej Sapkowski’s Witcher, it is an interesting start to what has the potential to be an engaging series.

**Multiverse - AK Larkwood’s The Unspoken Name (3\*)** is a wholly original blend of sci-fi, space opera and high fantasy!

Csorwe was a bride meant to be sacrificed to her god, but is offered a second chance at the last moment. She grabs her chance and sets off on an adventure to make the most of her new found life.

I recognise that it is a tremendous feat of imagination, executed very well by Larkwood, but ultimately I could not connect with it. I was always aware of reading the book and the narration, rather than being engrossed in it or imagining it in my mind’s eye.

It was pleasant reading the book but ultimately exhausting. Will probably read the conclusion, A Thousand Eyes, but it will be at an later, undetermined date.

**POC Author - Aliette de Bodard’s The Tea Master and the Detective (3\*)** is an interesting short story. The plot was kinda neither gripping nor boring - moving along nicely enough to keep flipping the pages. The characterisation felt a bit off though.

Tea Master has sufficiently aroused my interest to dig through the rest of this series eventually.

**4th Row**

**Book Club - J Zachary Pike’s Orconomics (3\*)** is a great sendup of the financial system with, surprisingly, lots of heart.

The overarching plot centres around the hijinks that ensue when a ragtag group of misfits are given a quest to redeem themselves.

The underlying setup is that raiding and questing and adventuring are the bedrock of economy. Being a hero is a profession with levels and advancements and guilds, everyone specialising in one skill - berserker, magic, weapons, ranging etc. The quests are valued based on the estimated loot and shares in the loot are bought and sold on the market by loot funds and guild houses. Obviously, profit motive and naked capitalism are valued over righteous quests and selfless heroics!

Pike is a clever author and manages to create impact through moments of humour, pathos, moments of genuine tragedy and some smart dialog.

**Novella - Adrian Tchaikovsky’s Ogres (4\*)** starts off as a medieval farm boy’s hero journey, veers into an examination of overpopulation, scarcity, slavery, human nature, greed before memorably culminating in a societal upheaval and rebellion - all in the course of one short novella!

This novella pulls off a couple of genre switches along the way and a great plot twist at the end.

**Mythical Beasts - Madeline Miller’s Circe (4\*)** is an engrossing take on Greek mythology. Circe is the daughter of the Titan Helios and is exiled for being a witch. Here she frets about not being like other girls and moping about the injustice done to her.

Characters from Greek mythology dip in and out and Miller does a fine job of weaving all the myths across Circe’s tale.

The writing is phenomenal - the prose is spare yet evocative. Enjoyable!

**Elemental Magic - Zamil Akhtar’s Gunmetal Gods (4\*)** is a complex yet riveting debut!

Eldritch horrors from beyond space-time, gore, gritty war, complex characters with complicated relationships and immense world building with dense mythology and religion - this book has it all!

Its like the Crusades with high fantasy and eldritch horrors!

The book has 2 main POVs - Kevah and Micah - on opposing sides of the Crusades and they are excellent. The supporting cast is also engaging.

Will definitely look the rest of the series up

**Myths/Retellings -** No book has left me as conflicted as **Gaurav Mohanty’s Sons of Darkness (4\*)**.

I cannot understand how a book can seem so derivative yet wholly original at the same time. That cognitive dissonance literally tore my head apart and kept me turning pages. Amazing stuff!

For the Mahabharata purists - this one will probably not go down well depending on your appetites.

I get what the author is trying to achieve with this book and it absolutely works.

As an epic, balls to the wall high fantasy with an Indian touch, it is undoubtedly the best entry in the genre from India. Mohanty manages to tell an excellent wholly original story within the framework of the known Mahabharata. Hats off for managing this improbable feat. The realism, cynicism, nihilism, brutality, gallows humor all hit their mark perfect.

The dialog is whip smart and bawdy, the geopolitical drama and caste conflicts evoke awe and disgust in equal measure, the action sequences are simultaneously brutal and heartbreaking and the plot is ever progressing.

Hopefully The Sons of Darkness spurs an exploration of Indian mythology in new and original ways.

All in all, it was unputdownable. Will definitely be keeping an eye on the rest of the series.

**5th Row**

**Queernorm -** Inspired by a song, **River Solomon's The Deep (4\*)** is a captivating and atmospheric book but a bit overwhelming.

The Wajinru are the descendants of the pregnant African women who were thrown overboard and left to drown during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Their unborn babies survived, were rescued and raised by whales.

This premise is the jumping off point for a story about slavery, genocide and death, but its also an exploration self and identity, what we owe our ancestors and starting new traditions.

This is not a book I would normally read and it left me unsettled, but in deep appreciation of it's artistic merit.

**Coastal/Island - John Marco’s The Bloody Chorus (4\*)** was bloody excellent from start to finish!

Once upon a time, Nessenor was the dominant power and the continent cowered in fury, but today the situation is reversed. The continental Alliance wants to make Nessenor a part of the alliance, non violently if possible.  This sets off a chain of fantastic and fantastical events which keep the reader begging for ‘one chapter more’.

The worldbuilding is on another level. The plot progresses with purpose and there are no untoward diversions or tangents.

Frankly, there is enough meat in this one story to publish an entire trilogy, and yet it never feels overwhelming or confusing.

All in all, The Bloody Chorus has it all - living, breathing characters, a pantheon of awesome gods, some terrific twists in a great plot and just a generally entertaining story!

**Druids - Morgan Llywelyn’s Druids (4\*)** is a wonderful story of friendship, war, culture, magic and history. The descriptions of the Celts’ beliefs, superstitions, way of life, traditions, code of conduct is beautiful and paints a vivid picture of the druidic culture.

At it’s core, Druids is the story of the Gallic Conquest by Caesar told from the point of view of the losing side. It tells of a way of life, culture and history that the Celts were trying to save.

Overall, a great book and an enjoyable read.

**Robots - A Lee Martinez’s Automatic Detective (4\*)** is an enjoyable book with heart.

Mack Megaton is a 700 pound robot built for world domination, but has reformed and is on his best behaviour as he is seeks citizenship. By quirk of programming, he has the freewill ‘glitch’. One day, his neighbours go missing. He enlists the help of his colleague - an erudite gorilla. His quest leads him through his rat faced, but fair parole officer to a brilliant and sexy dame with a thing for robots.

His quest grows sillier from here - and I mean it in the best way. Fun!

**Sequel - Ellis Peter’s The Leper of St. Giles (5\*)** is a delightful historical murder mystery.

Brother Cadfael is undoubtedly the hero of this book - infinitely patient, dogged, keenly analytical and just hyper competent. I fell in love with the character immediately upon reading him for the the first time.

The rest of the characters are also varied and interesting. The story has its share of twists and turns and manages to hold the reader’s attention.

Will definitely dip in and out of this series over time.

Meet Kyle Robertson and Noah LeBlanc, the duo who we follow in this adventure. Both of them love coffee (who doesn’t?!), singing songs in the car at the top of their voices (especially related to the horror genre), and share a mutual fascination for all things mystery and horror. Kyle is the more “funny/comedy/don’t really care” type, while Noah is more of the – “play by the rules” guy. But it is safe to say, the duo has some nice banter, chemistry, and bromance going on throughout (which is a major highlight). What really binds them together (apart from their top notch banter, of course) is the podcast show that they both host together, conveniently called –

[ Noah LeBlanc \(left\); Kyle Robertson \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/9k1xzk0y0hpc1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=89e4421dad6c3fdb5db2c236507fede17de8910c)

But it is much more than just any other podcast –

>*You and I started this show ‘cause of a shared interest in the world and its mysteries. True crime, the supernatural, dark matter and quantum entanglement—whatever. If there was a mystery out there, you and I covered it. We even solved a few ourselves.*

Life is going pretty okay for the both of them, until one “Man-Day” (where it’s just the duo having fun together – shopping, watching movies, and doing all the nerdy stuff) … things are about to change… for the worse.

>*Oh, I’m* ***beyond*** *nervous! When I woke up today, I thought the worst of my problems was bad dreams and poor judgment in women, and that was pretty bad, but now… I’m straight up terrified!*  
>  
>*Kyle*

In a horrifying turn of events, our duo gets entangled with something that is… not quite natural. Oh, and they are gonna need some help if they are to get out of this alive. Ruby Spears, a psychic and a palm/tarot card reader, seems like their only hope. But can the old man be trusted after they busted his “fake” business via their podcast and left him out to dry? As they face a threat which is “too hot to handle”, there is no choice but to form an unexpected alliance… and run for their dear lives! Kyle describes their situation rather too well –

>*This is insane! I’m shaking, my ears are ringing, my heart’s beating like crazy, I gotta pee, and I might need to vomit too!*

https://preview.redd.it/hm8ris151hpc1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=466b5ff3b74ad0e06ef8d49a751898c3e0464342

A pretty accurate reaction, don’t you think? From here on, things will be getting crazier by the second, and as the story progresses, we the reader, along with Kyle and Noah, will find out what “Evil” is well and truly all about… and as the saying goes…

>*‘When you gaze long into the abyss…’ ‘… the Abyss gazes also into you.’*  
*Nietzsche*

Gear up for an adventure quite unlike any other, filled with action, loads of humor, multiple Easter eggs/references thrown in for good measure, black magic users, some truly crazy people, and even crazier plotline twists and turns. Trust me… you won’t be able to guess what’s around the corner, and you certainly ain’t ready for it! (you better be though!).

**What I really enjoyed about it**

* First up, the characters – all of them! Not only very well-written, but also not easily forgettable, and will leave you wanting for more!
* The duo of Kyle and Noah was just too good! As I’ve mentioned above, their banter/chemistry/bromance was top notch!
* The plot was really engaging and truly excellent! And it doesn’t end there too…
* The artwork/illustrations were great as well. Loved the style of it.
* The humor was actually pretty solid, and I enjoyed it very much.
* The ending was near perfect, and sets up the next volume very nicely.

**What was off the mark?**

* NOT A THING! (at least in my personal, honest opinion).

**Here’s a quick glance at what you can expect…**

>*Wow.*  
*A nun and a cop smoking pot… there’s a joke in there somewhere.*  
*Yep.*  
>  
>*Just a normal Kyle and Noah conversation (had to put this one in!)*

**Other info.**

* There are loads of Easter eggs/references present throughout! (posters for ‘Evil Dead 2’, ‘Jaws’, ‘Amityville Horror’, etc. + ‘Friday the 13th’+ ‘Silence of the Lambs’… and many, many more!).
* Each chapter has a really great illustration/artwork to go alongside it. Loved that!
* ***Note: –*** Mature themes are present throughout (foul language, blood/gore, death/violence; not suitable for younger audiences).

**Final thoughts**

Had an absolute BLAST with it! What an amazing graphic novel it turned out to be; definitely surpassing my initial expectations too! The characters are memorable and very well-written. The plot is excellent, and will leave you wanting for more. The humor is top notch, and the horror/thriller elements are pretty good as well. Honestly, LOVED it, and ENJOYED it to the fullest. Can’t wait for Volume 2, seriously. HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you check it out!

Night Angel, from its description, seems to have everything I'd love in a novel. Magic, assassins, gutter rat to lovable rogue, etc. 

But I've also heard that the series, and it's writer, have had... a somewhat complicated history with their portrayal of women. 

I don't really know any specifics but whenever I see Night Angel or Lightbringer come up, there's always one comment way at the bottom, one small voice, mentioning how Weeks doesn't portray women all that well. 

This has become one of my pet peeves as I've grown up, bad writing for women is very common in fantasy so I try to do my best to avoid it. 

So I'm coming here, hat in my hand, asking for specifics. How exactly are the women in Night Angel depicted. Do you feel that it's respectful, accurate, sexist, problematic, or even just lazy?

1710931396.0,Emily Wildes Map of the Other worlds thoughts and spoilers?  ,"So, encyclopedia of fairies was one of my favorite books of 2023. I thought it was adventurous with some slight romance and nothing too crazy. I loved the style of writing with footnotes at the bottom of the pages. I was also a fan of the female protagonist and her strong stance on what she wanted to do. 





(Spoilers) However, I read map of the other worlds and I was slightly disappointed. I was not expecting so much time in-between. I was also not a fan of the consistent ""leading on"" by Emily. Why is it taking you a year to answer this man? Also, can we talk about this whole ""missing door"" plotline? Why were we told that Wendall couldn't find his door and then it takes Emily like two seconds to find the door and it's literally just a doorknob with Moss on the opposite side of a fairie door? Why is my man over here searching for ten years while hiding? It's also annoying that all these characters go with them and then they find De Grey but shes worthless and rude other than showing them a door!?

After thinking about why that is, I came to the conclusion that it might be the fact that these books have multiple (connected) story lines rather than focussing on one particular character and its journey (e.g. like in The Hobbit, Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Hunger Games, Maze Runner).

How well would European Dragons, get along with Asian Dragons and Mesoamerican dragons? For that matter would Irish Selkies get along with Mami Wata (African Mermaids) and Sirenas (Filipino)?

1710898341.0,New Here: Looking for (specific) Help ,"Hi all,
I read through some of the stickied posts and have spent the afternoon searching this sub, but nothing is confirming what exactly I'm looking for. I'll be blunt, I've never read high fantasy books before, but I want to get into it. I'm 45 years old with a huge imagination and lots of patience. My midlife crisis has been getting back into gaming (I grew up with Atari/NES, etc.). I always played sports games during my teen-20's-30's years, but I jumped into the fantasy genre and haven't looked back. That said, I'm looking to explore some reading so I can take an even deeper dive. Here's what I like, and thus, would like the book/series I choose to have these characteristics. 

-Dark settings, creepy forests, catacombs, dungeons, swamps, etc. You get the idea. 

-Medieval, magic, huge swords, battles, human vs human, human vs monsters.

-Character development and world building

-More monsters (bestiaries are a bonus!)

-A dark theme overall, but it doesn't have to be ALL dark

-A fictional world/land/etc.

I can't think of anything else specifically, other than that I'm a rookie with reading fantasy. I'd love to jump into a series of about 3 books or so, so I can feel like I'm really investing in something. 

I'm open to answering any follow up questions to help in assisting me with choosing something. 

I'm not really into anything Hobbit/LOTR/Or ASOFAI, as Im looking for something completely new/different from those stories, which by now, I'm pretty familiar with.

1710897984.0,Empire of The Damned by Jay Kristoff Review!,"Such an awesome book! It was damn near the perfect experience. Lately It’s been really hard for me to find epic fantasy series that I enjoy. It’s started to seem like Progression fantasy is the only genre I really like anymore.  So many Epic fantasy stories I’ve read all seem formulaic and boring with nothing engaging to draw me in. It’s surprisingly hard to find a well done fresh take on fantasy. The last one I enjoyed was the Will of Many. I won’t claim The Empire of the Vampire is the most unique thing I’ve ever read, but the story, pacing, world, intrigue, and general atmosphere all feels so fresh to me.

The first thing I want to praise is Jay Kristoff’s story telling ability. The ability to have a complete narrative and knowing how to drip feed the story in a compelling way. The best example that comes to mind was giving us the POV of Celene. I thought the whole series would be split between Gabriel’s past and the Dior timeline. Gabriel definitely still has a lot in his past that would be worth exploring but I like how this time we got references and commentary from the characters to paint the picture instead. Lachlan’s past and the Dyvok stuff was handled well using that method. It’s a small detail but I really like that decision.  I also like how we didn’t need to take half to book to explore Celene’s past either. A lot of story telling decisions like those really paid off. 

The twists were also genius. There were several moments where I screamed  “OH shit!” out loud. The secret of the Golden vials, How the Dyvok took over Osway, Conner’s fate, and Gabe’s father. They all were perfectly hinted at and made so much sense once things were revealed. That’s the feeling that I can’t get no where else besides epic fantasy!

The Dyvok and the Dusk dancers were cool additions. I love the Voss but the Dyvok had such a savage aggressive energy as opposed to the hard and cold as ice of the Voss. Their strength and Nakita as a villain was terrifying. The last battle really worked cause of them. The Voss’s role was important too, especially the twins and the last conversations with Fabian but overall I loved that we got to see more of the other vampire clans. I hope we get to see the other 2 lines in the next book.

The Dusk dancers were sooooo cool. Honestly the funnest stuff in the book was when Gabe was fighting a group of them butt naked. I hope we get to see more of the bear kin especially cause I think they would be my favorite.

Gawd I love these characters. Gabriel is amazing and I love him. I feel every heart break, every moment of victory and defeat, every feeling of thirst and addiction. He is the living legend that I am grateful we get to follow. Every deed feels believable in a flawed human way. The black lion is the warrior the world needs

Aaron and Batista’s story line and love story throughout these first 2 books continues to be the bleeding heart of the narrative. It’s so beautiful and I just love the decision to keep them relevant. I could imagine another author deciding to leave them behind for the foreseeable future and maybe bringing them back in the very last book. I hope they stick around from now on.

Dior is becoming the exact type of character I wanted her to be. The messiah to save us all. Her pure heart will turn people towards her cause more then her blood will. The type of character that thousands of years from now the world will remember her for the legendary divine Goddess she is. I love her relationships with Gabe and the father daughter dynamic they start to form. Her learning to fight and using her blood as a weapon against the vampires is the type of thing I love to see(as a progression fantasy fan). That ending with her gave me goosebumps!

Celene is complicated. I love her addition to the story and my heart bleeds for what happened to her but damn she was pissing me off. There were so many times I wanted Gabe to just kill her and get it over with. All the lies, unnecessary secrets and betrayals, and most of all I think her hatred towards Gabe is undeserved. I get why she was hurt but to take that anger out on Gabe is crazy to me. I’m sure there’s more to the story but as of now I just wanted her to die off to save Gabe the stress.

Phoebe was another great addition. I actually loved her sexual tension with Gabe and the accompanying sex scenes. The twist of her being the lion from the last book was unexpected but also made a lot of sense.",Fantasy

**Title With a Title (Hard Mode - Not a title of royalty)**

**The Riddle-Master of Hed by Patirica A. McKillip (5/5 Stars)**

I read this as a part of my ongoing mission to read older fantasy books that are out-of-print or I haven't run into because they don't turn up on 'classics' lists.

I really love the Riddle-Master (and its two sequels, which I read immediately afterwards).. The tone is so different to most modern fantasy, with less world-building and specific descriptions of how magic is used or how cultures work, and more fairy-tale-like wonder and mystery. It was such a breath of fresh air. There is a constant feeling of wonder about the world and the events of the plot, as well as a sense of destiny playing out. The names are also fantastic, with many names and places derived from the Welsh language as well as just general fantastical whimsy.

The story of this book is lovely and almost dreamlike, with lots of adventure and magic, as well as plenty of riddles and poetic language, as the hero goes on an adventure to learn (and outrun) his destiny, meeting shape-changers, musicians, kings and all manner of strange folk on the way. It's not really like anything else I've ever read and I would highly recommend it. 

The Riddle-Master is also the only book I’ve ever read that I feel earns its reputation as ‘Tolkienesque’. Most modern fantasy is definitely inspired by Tolkien, but this is the only work that has evoked the same feelings in me.

**Superheroes (Hard Mode - not related to Marvel or DC)**

**Worm by Wildbow (2.5/5 Stars)**

I wondered at first why it was taking me so long to read this book - I was on arc 24 of 30 and so far had been reading the book in my spare time for 2 weeks. At that point I looked it up, and found out that the book is over 6000 pages long, or around 1.7 million words. That is as long as all the Game of Thrones books combined, which explains why I found it took so long to get through! After discovering that, I decided to combine this book with others and just read a little at a time, which was a much more enjoyable way to experience it.

I quite enjoyed Worm, although I think I would have enjoyed it much more if I had read it as intended - over 2 years, with each bite-sized chapter posted twice a week every week - rather than trying to read it all in one go. If I were starting to read it now, I would recommend reading each of the 30 arcs as their own individual novels, parcelling them out as you might a long fantasy series like Wheel of Time.

Despite the slog of trying to finish 30 novels in one go, Worm is a great superhero story. The action scenes are dynamic and well-written, the world is well-realised and the characters and plot remain interesting despite the story's length. Taylor herself remains the focus throughout, and is a very likable character, both growing as a person and growing into her powers with each arc. She is always trying her best to make things better, despite ever-mounting pressures from the cruel world she lives in.

**Bottom of the TBR (No HM)**

**Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card (5/5 Stars)**

I did not expect to enjoy this book. It’s a classic, I better cross it off the list, I thought. At least it’s short, I thought!

What a fool I was. I adored Ender’s Game and devoured it in one sitting. I felt like it filled in a piece of the puzzle of YA fiction, movies and anime that I didn’t know I was missing. This book is the progenitor of so many tropes that I didn’t even know were tropes, and it does them so, so well.

Ender as a character is such an incredibly smart, incredibly nice boy who is forced into such awful situations and terrible actions that my heart was hurting for him the entire time.

The plotting is so well-done that while the climax felt in some ways inevitable (and, thanks to all the media this book has influenced, so obvious) when it came it was also both unexpected and an emotional gut-punch.

I loved this book so, so much and would recommend the few other people who haven’t read it yet to do so. The only regret I have is that I didn’t read it when I too was a teenager and would have appreciated the story even more.

**Magical Realism (Hard Mode - Not in the Magical Realism thread)**

**Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt (4/5 Stars)**

This is a delightful modern fiction book that just happens to have a sentient octopus as one of its protagonists (So I think it counts!).

It’s not my usual thing, but I really enjoyed Remarkably Bright Creatures. I loved Marcellus and Tova, the main protagonists, and like Marcellus, I really wanted all the human protagonists to figure out what was going on and be happy!

I found myself a little frustrated with the other main protagonist, Cameron, whose self-sabotaging tendencies just kept making his life so much more difficult than it needed to be. I was worried towards the end that noone would communicate with each other, and nothing would be resolved, but luckily they did, and they were, and there was even a happy ending! The last third of the book definitely dragged a bit until the resolution of the plot, but apart from that it was very quick, and I always wanted to know what happened next. I also always appreciate an older protagonist in my fiction.

A very enjoyable book and highly recommended!

**Young Adult (Hard Mode - Published in the last five years)**

**Iron Widow by Xirin Jay Zhao (5/5 Stars)**

This is an amazing ride of a book, a science fiction young adult adventure all about revenge and feminism and Chinese history and giant robots. It also contains that rarest of treasures, the true love triangle we all yearn for.

Such a fun and intense book, a real page-turner and exactly what I wanted for the summer.

Highly recommended if you like The Hunger Games, Pacific Rim, Evangelion, She Who Became The Sun or just a really good time.

The only regret I have about Iron Widow is that I have so little knowledge of Chinese history that I know I'm missing a lot of context - I'm sure it would be even better if I had some.

**Mundane Jobs (Hard Mode - Does not take place on earth)**

**A Wizard’s Guide to Defensive Baking by T. Kingfisher (5/5 Stars)**

Another children's book by T. Kingfisher, and I find myself enjoying her kids' books even more than I do those for adults. Many of her adult books have a strong focus on romance, which isn't a favourite genre of mine, and the lack of it in this book as well as Illuminations was really refreshing, and I found the stories stronger for it.

While a bit darker than the title would suggest, this is a lovely children's tale of unconventional magic and I would recommend it for fans of Diana Wynne Jones. A lot of really fun baking facts and unusual uses of magic, as well as thoughts on heroism and children in war, a great read!

**Published in the 00s (Hard Mode - Not in the top 30 of** r/Fantasy**’s Best of 2023 List)**

**House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski (5/5 Stars)**

This was a wonderful book, and a lovely surprise as I wasn't expecting to like it nearly as much as I did.

House of Leaves is an experimental literary horror novel, a film within a book within a book within a book.

Each of the interpretations and stories within the book contains many viewpoints, characters, footnotes and perspectives. Sometimes the different perspectives are literal - passages are backwards or upside-down or structured to make a picture, or a sentence is split over several pages.

I didn't know much about the plot going in, but I did know about this narrative and structural experimentation. As a near-exclusive genre fiction reader, and committed reader-for-pleasure, this made me really leery of the book. I thought it would be very dense, very difficult to read, a slog to get through and a bit pretentious. However, I was very pleasantly surprised - while some passages could be hard to get my head around, most were very easy and natural to read despite how they may have appeared. I certainly didn't understand all of the literary references, or references to the language of film criticism, but I found I could enjoy the book and find a lot in it despite this.

The innermost story, the fictional documentary film about a house that is bigger on the inside than it appears on the outside, is surprisingly simple and intriguing. I don't often read horror, and found this story not too scary - it was very good at evoking a feeling of unease and tension throughout the narrative, but I wasn't kept awake thinking about it and it didn't give me nightmares, which is always what I worry about going into a scary book.

Outside of this, there is the story of Johnny Truant, who finds the text of criticism that contains the plot of the movie and becomes increasingly more unstable as he tries to piece together both the book and the truth of the events described in it. I found him a really interesting character, and surprisingly sympathetic given how unlikeable his actions are. I always enjoy a narrator who admits straight away that he is a habitual liar and teller of tales, then goes on to tell a story he says is true.

In keeping with this, a lot of time reading the book is spent trying to work out what the truth of the movie is, and since it can't possibly all be true, who made up which details and why. Was the movie a triumph of special effects, and did it ever exist in the first place? Was it invented by Zampano, the blind film critic whose death begins the narrative? Or were he, his volume of criticism, and the documentary all made up by Johnny, who reveals many hidden depths as the story goes along?

I really can't do this book justice by describing it, so I would urge anyone intrigued by the ideas or plot to give it a read.

**Angels and Demons (Hard Mode - Protagonist is an angel or demon)**

**Penric’s Demon by Lois McMaster Bujold (5/5 Stars)**

The Penric and Desdemona series was the only set of Lois McMaster Bujold’s books that I hadn’t yet read and I dove into them this year. The recommendations are right, these are great!

Penric is my favourite type of protagonist, a Very Nice Boy who is a bit clueless and just bumbles along, trying to do the right thing as well as he can. Desdemona is a centuries-old demon with the shared personalities of many strong and long-lived women, so she is a glorious foil to him.

It’s really interesting to read how they help and change each other through this book and the following ones and the series is a new favourite.

**Five SFF Short Stories (Hard Mode - Read an entire SFF anthology or collection)**

**Dreams Underfoot by Charles de Lint (4.5/5 Stars)**

This book introduced me to Charles de Lint’s Newford stories and I am so, so grateful for that. 

This short story anthology is a lovely series of glimpses into a world where magic and mundane reality are intertwined more closely than in any other urban fantasy series I have ever read. The world in which Newford sits isn’t an alternate reality, or a secret world of magic hidden behind our own. This is our own world - and if we look closely and at the right angle, we can see the magic in it too. It’s also lovely, as someone from the UK, to read a fantasy so rooted in America, which is pretty hard to find in a tradition that primarily pulls on European history and myth.

I would highly recommend this book and the Newford series in general. This book is only marked down from 5 stars because I struggle to follow short stories as much as novels, and because I preferred the following novel Memory and Dream.

**Horror (Hard Mode - Not by Stephen King or H. P. Lovecraft)**

**The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins (5/5 Stars)**

This was a wonderful book, even though it gave me nightmares. I don't usually read horror! But because this was also literary fantasy, and also about a library (sort of) and had also come extremely highly recommended, I was intrigued and gave it a go.

I certainly don't regret it, the story is fascinating and the unravelling mysteries of the plot are so compelling that I couldn't stop reading if I had wanted to. There are also some surprisingly likable characters in the horrible, horrible world of this book. The shifting throughout the story toward a totally non-human perspective was something very new to me and really blew me away when I reached the end.

But it is very horrible indeed - reader beware.

**Self-Published OR Indie Publisher (Hard Mode - Fewer than 100 ratings on Goodreads OR an indie publisher that has done an AMA with** r/Fantasy**)**

**Body After Body by Briar Ripley Page (5/5 Stars)**

This was a really excellent sci-fi/horror novella, but extremely difficult to review due to both its experimental writing style and provocative nature.

I would warn any prospective readers that any content warnings you can think of probably apply to this book - including violence, death, sexual content, body horror (lots), cannibalism and medical- and gender-related trauma.

Body After Body is a self-published science fiction novella which is based on the concept album Moon Colony Bloodbath by John Darnielle and John Vanderslice. I haven't listened to the album, but I was recommended the book as a little-read but excellent speculative fiction piece, and I didn't find myself missing out due to a lack of context. The book definitely stands on its own.

Body After Body is set in a future earth in which climate disaster has left earth much less habitable, and the rich and powerful live on the Moon, on Mars and on satellites orbiting the dying planet. Medical care has become trivial due to the availability of lab-grown tissues and medicines, but this too is available only to the richest in society. Poorer people can be given all necessary and desired medical care if they sign up to have their memories erased, and to tend one of the earth-based laboratories which grow the organs needed for treatment of off-world patients. The novel is set in one of these facilities, with mind-wiped protagonists navigating the crumbling facility they look after and their own identities as conditions in the lab steadily become more untenable.

In many ways this is a classic science fiction fable, with the conceit of the narrative becoming obvious long before it is revealed in the text. However this seems to me more like a deliberate narrative device, serving to make the horror more horrific, and the eventual climax of the story and collapse of the facility feel even more inevitable. The characters are relatable despite their brainwashed states and the sometimes awful things they do, the writing style is beautiful and experimental, and the themes explored are both relevant to the state of the world as the story was written, and personally-relevant to myself. I have rarely come across a speculative fiction book that made me feel quite so seen, and addressed contemporary issues while remaining an engaging story in its own right.

I would highly recommend this book if you are trans, queer, interested in highly-relevant science fiction and have an extremely strong stomach. It was wonderful and horrible, and it will be in my thoughts for a long time.

**Set in the Middle East (Hard Mode - Author is of Middle Eastern heritage)**

**Girl, Serpent, Thorn by Melissa Bashardoust (3.5/5 Stars)**

This is a lovely little meditation on fairy tales and stories, which explores lots of common themes of fairy tales while the protagonist fights to find her place in a world she can’t touch. The imagery and descriptions of the city, forest and mountain this book is set in were wonderful and really pulled me into the story.

**Published in 2023 (Hard Mode - Author’s debut novel)**

**Godkiller by Hannah Kaner (3.5/5 Stars)**

Godkiller was a really fun adventure in a world where gods are both common and predatory, preying on human populations for the belief, rituals and sacrifices they need in order to live and grow.

I think I enjoyed the concept of this book more than the actual story, although I enjoyed the story very much. The characters we see the story through seemed less developed than the world they live in, and I found myself wishing they were less incidental to the setting. Even so, I would recommend this book as a unique fantasy setting and I look forward to reading the next instalment.

**Multiverse and Alternate Realities (Hard Mode - Characters do not walk through a literal door)**

**The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making by Catherynne M. Valente (4.5/5 Stars)**

This was a book that had been on my to-read list for a while, so I was really surprised to learn it was only published in 2011. I think I assumed it was a 20th-century book and was mistaken? It definitely feels older than it is (a compliment!).

I haven’t read anything else by this author so wasn’t sure what to expect and I really loved this. It is a delightful little journey through Fairyland and fairy tales, ones we know and ones that are totally original, yet feel right at home with the classics. September feels like a classic fairytale protagonist, and also like a real child, and behaves a lot like I imagine I might have if spirited off to Fairyland at that age. I loved all the incidental characters, who also felt fully-realised, no matter how briefly they appeared on the page.

**POC Author (Hard Mode - Futuristic, Sci-fi world)**

**Dawn by Octavia E. Butler (3.5/5 Stars)**

I really don't know how to feel about this one. It's incredibly well-written, affecting and thought-provoking. I also didn't enjoy reading it.

Dawn is set a few hundred years in the future, after nuclear war has all-but wiped out the human race. An alien civilisation rescues what is left of humanity, and tasks Lilith with re-founding human civilisation on earth. The book explores the alien culture, and how a human might relate to beings so truly alien.

The story also has a sort of creeping horror about it that is never resolved and I could never quite escape. The entire premise is truly horrific, and the way it is framed, there is no hope of escape. The characters must either accept their new reality or die. The main character chooses acceptance and assimilation, which in the context of the story is the only sensible choice, but it's also just really awful to read about.

Of course, not every story needs to be enjoyable - I suspect I just wasn't in the right frame of mind for this one. An incredibly interesting book, but not one I am keen to revisit.

**Book Club or Readalong Book (Hard Mode - Read a current Book Club or Readalong selection and participate in the discussion)**

**The Genesis of Misery by Neon Yang (2/5 Stars)**

This was definitely my least favourite of the books I ended up putting on my Bingo card this year.

I struggled with this book both because some of the themes were very rough for me personally, and because I found that the tone of the writing kept putting me off. I listened to this as an audiobook, and the narrator used a very flat affect when reading what was already fairly flat prose. While this was certainly deliberate, it meant that I was constantly struggling to concentrate on the story, and found the plot and characters unlikeable and dull as a result.

I may come back to this book, in written form, in future, if only to see if it holds up any better. For now I can only say I’m glad I got through it.

I am extremely grateful for this Bingo square, as it pushed me to participate in a Book Club discussion for the first time, which was nerve-wracking but really fun. Hopefully next year I will do some more.

**Novella (Hard Mode - Not published by tordotcom)**

**Black Unicorn by Tanith Lee (5/5 Stars)**

Black Unicorn is a short fantasy novel about Tanaquil, a young woman who is the unmagical daughter of a powerful sorceress, growing up in a fortress in the middle of a desert far away from any cities or other people. Her only talent is the mending of any mechanical device or structure. The book starts when she assembles the skeleton of a mysterious creature, who is then animated into the black unicorn of the title. The unicorn runs away and Tanaquil follows, finding adventure and destiny along the way.

I loved this strange, magical fairytale-like book. The rich descriptions of the environments were incredibly evocative and the plot is full of adventure despite being so short. It was a lovely little book that I enjoyed wholeheartedly and I am so happy to have found it.

**Mythical Beasts (Hard Mode - No dragons)**

**Magic’s Pawn by Mercedes Lackey (4/5 Stars)**

This was a great book, both on its own merits and because it was an early example (Published in 1989) of an openly gay man in a mainstream fantasy novel. 

Having already read Arrows of the Queen, I had some idea of what I was in for with this book, although I definitely enjoyed this one more. Not only are there the destined magical horse companions for the lonely, damaged children who tend to end up as Heralds, but also traditional mage magic, and the book and the following series follows the protagonist through a great deal of his life as well as the affairs of the kingdom.

Like Arrows of the Queen, my least favourite thing about this book was how thoroughly Lackey puts her protagonists through the wringer. Horrible, horrible things happen to Vanyel with a regularity that feels a little excessive.

That said, I am very glad I finally got around to reading this.

**Elemental Magic (Hard Mode - Not Shades of Magic or Codex Alera)**

**The Initiate by Louise Cooper (4/5 Stars)**

Another book in my pursuit of older fantasy that I missed the first time around.

I actually read Louise Cooper’s Daughter of Storms children’s series many, many years ago so reading The Initiate for the first time filled in a lot of gaps I didn’t realise were there.

I enjoyed The Initiate, but it’s definitely meant to be read as part of a series; by the time I reached the end, it felt like the story was only just beginning.

This first part concerns Tarod fighting against his fate and trying to find somewhere to fit in while his destiny and part of his self are constantly fighting against him. I was rooting for Tarod throughout and I found the story very interesting to read, but it felt like it was missing any kind of conclusion.

I really look forward to reading the rest of the series!

**Myths and Retellings (Hard Mode - Not Greek or Roman mythology)**

**Starling House by Alix E. Harrow (3.5/5 Stars)**

I was really looking forward to Starling House, as I had previously read The Ten Thousand Doors of January and The Once and Future Witches by this author and loved them.

While I did enjoy Starling House, it definitely was not in the same league as these previous books. I didn’t find the characters as likeable, and I found the plot much more simplistic than I was expecting.

That said, it’s still a very good book! I always wanted to solve the next mystery along with Opal, and I liked the theme of making a home in a place you’ve always tried to escape. I also really liked the Kentucky setting, which is one I’ve never run across in fiction before.

**Queernorm setting (Hard Mode - Not a futuristic setting)**

**Witch King by Martha Wells (4/5 Stars)**

I really, really struggled with this book to begin with, and I’m so glad I went back to it and persevered. It starts out bewilderingly, with names, details and events coming thick, fast and unexplained. 

The setting, mythology, history and characters are developed piecemeal throughout the narrative, which itself has two threads - one in the past, following Kai’s life and rise to power, and one in the present. Bits of each narrative are explained and expanded upon in the other, and it requires a lot of concentration to follow. As such, I really had to wait until I was in a patient mood to keep up with the story, but it was also totally worth it! I came to really like Kai, his friends, and to be invested in the world and its politics and history.

**Coastal or Island Setting (Hard Mode - Also involves seafaring)**

**Inda by Sherwood Smith (4/5 Stars)**

Inda is definitely a fantasy book, but is set in a world not unlike our own, if the Mongols had taken over Medieval China, Japan and Eastern Europe. It is about a noble boy, Inda, who goes to train as a warrior at the royal palace, and the adventures and political machinations that befall him.

The world and culture are really interesting in this book, as the culture is highly based on war and warriors, with separate languages and titles for war- and peace-time, and everyone in society trained to fight, either to go off to conquer new lands or to defend their own.

This is a proper fantasy adventure book, full of fighting and training and swashbuckling. Inda as a character is extremely competent but also really sweet, which stops the hypercompetence from becoming grating. I always wanted to know what was going to happen next.

My least favourite part of the book was all the political scheming, which is good because Inda is, for the most part, oblivious to it all, so it isn't lingered-upon too much. Other characters have point-of-view chapters occasionally to throw some light onto events that Inda isn't present for, and those characters are all very likable too. These chapters are short and infrequent, so it doesn't take away too much from all the adventuring.

I really liked this book and I am looking forward to reading the sequels and other novels set in this world. There's a little much war for my taste but it's written so well that I didn't mind so much.

**Druids (Hard Mode - Not the Iron Druid chronicles)**

**Gods of the Wyrd Wood by R. J. Barker (4.5/5 Stars)**

This was my first book by R. J. Barker, despite hearing great things about their books, and I was not disappointed!

In many ways this was a very classical fantasy epic, full of magic and heroism, which I am a huge fan of, but I also really enjoyed the elements that make Gods of the Wyrd Wood unique.

I liked the structure of the book a lot - rather than one long journey, Cahan returns over and over to his farm and adoptive village home, attempting to reclaim his new life and eventually defending his neighbours from the wider world. It was very slow to start, but when the story threads and clues start coming together I was very keen to see what happened next. I loved the forest-based world, the wooden armour and mushroom-based magical powers. I also liked Cahan's reclusive and reluctant heroism, and the extremely flawed but endearing supporting characters. I ended the book wanting to know what happened next (the book is due to be the first of a trilogy) but the ending was still very satisfying. I also found the complete lack of a romance subplot very refreshing!

**Featuring Robots (Hard Mode - Robot is the protagonist)**

**Klara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro (4.5/5 Stars)**

This was a lovely and deeply sad little book. It wasn't at all what I was expecting, but I still liked it very much. I found it less about love and what makes a human heart, and more about loneliness and hope, and about navigating a world you can't quite understand.

I really enjoyed the tiny hints at what the book's future world looks like. I also liked Klara's character and relentless optimism, but my favourite thing was actually Klara's descriptions of the Sun, which gave life to an otherwise very dry, grey world.

**Sequel (Hard Mode - Book 3 or on in the series)**

**Be The Serpent by Seanan McGuire (4/5 Stars)**

I am so far down the October Daye rabbit hole now that I will read every new book no matter how good or bad it is. Luckily, they’ve all been good so far!

At this point in the series there is a lot of recap at the beginning, and a lot of big-picture plot revelations, so the smaller booklong plots take a backseat, which is a shame as the stories in the first few books were what got me into the series at the beginning. There’s also a lot of plot that now happens in the accompanying short stories, which you can only find by reading the print versions of the books, and might be extremely confusing for people reading electronically.

I did enjoy the feeling of the series-long plot coming slowly and ponderously into place in this book, with tiny little plot threads coming together and making sense of previous events. The ride, as always, was fun, but I look forward to more mystery and mayhem next time.

1710880433.0,One Mike to Read them All: “Lent” by Jo Walton,"First thing I want to say: it was entirely coincidence that I read *Lent* during the season of Lent. It did not cross my mind until a friend pointed it out.

Jo Walton, as always, is really big on all things Florence. This book is set at the end of the 15th century, beginning at the time of the death of Lorenzo de' Medici. It’s historical fiction as much as it is fantasy; the main character is [Girolamo Savonarola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Savonarola), a Dominican friar who became de facto leader of Florence after Lorenzo’s son Piero fucked things up and fled the city. At least, that is how it starts. 

As in real life, Girolamo is eventually convicted and burned for heresy (there’s a memorial plaque marking the spot in the Palazzo Vecchio). And here is where things diverge; Girolamo finds himself in Hell, enduring pain and despair until he starts his life again at the beginning of the book, the day before Lorenzo’s death. But this time, he remembers the life he lived before, and resolves to do better. He wants to do a better job of protecting Florence, and he wants to save more souls, and he wants to find his own redemption. So he tries again.

And then he tries again. And again. And again. *Groundhog Day* is the obvious and entirely appropriate comparison.

On the whole, I rate this as four stars. I enjoyed the journey immensely. Reading Girolamo’s struggles, his determination, and his despair was a very moving experience. And I enjoyed Walton’s meticulous research, even if it did slow down my progress in the book when I kept being distracted by looking things up on Wikipedia.

Loses a star for the ending. Spoilers without specifics: >!it felt like a *Deus ex machina*, on more than one level.!<

1710879495.0,I just finished reading the first book of Bloodsworn saga and... ,"I often see the saga being recommended here, I really like the Nordic background, so I thought I was on for a hell of a ride. 

And a hell of a ride it was. I knew the prose of Gwynne was not his strong point. Actually, to me, it was so much his weak point that I often closed the book in the middle of a chapter. 

The ""thought-cage"" thing is being talked about a lot, but there are so much repetitions in the whole text, plus the overuse of ""-ing"" (which is maybe only a problem in French, I don't know if English speaking people are bothered by it). Almost all the sentences are written in the same structure. The most disturbing thing about it that sometimes characters also use this structure (even the bard relating old tales use this structure). I found it really didn't help to get immersed in the world. 

For the last point, it might be because I am a bit dumb, but I felt like it was hard to tell different characters apart when they spoke, and given all the characters there are in this book it got me a bit lost (once again, I'm dumb so we can omit this point). 

I'm glad I'm finished, I don't know if I'll keep going with book two, but I wanted to know if other people dropped it too for this reason, or if I'm too focused on the prose and not the actual story of the book.

THE EMPIRE OF THE WOLF trilogy follows the story of Sir Konrad Vonvalt, who has been variously described as a fantasy Cicero, Judge Dredd, Geralt of Rivia, Sherlock Holmes and Eisenhorn. He is an investigator, lawyer, prosecutor, judge, jury and executioner all in one, sworn to travel the Sovan Empire and dispense justice. The story, however, is not told by Sir Konrad, but by his clerk, 20 year-old Helena Sedanka. Helena is now an old woman recounting a time of great upheaval in the empire as a Neman priest, Bartholomew Claver, tries to overthrow the Imperial throne using… well, eldritch forces he probably shouldn’t be meddling with.

As for me, I’m a British writer currently living in Sydney, Australia, with my wife and two small sons.

&nbsp;

**Title with a Title - Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Dinniman - 3.5 stars**

Not the best book I read all year, but possibly the most fun, and the series only gets more entertaining as it goes along. Also definitely an example of a book that is elevated massively by listening to the audiobook, which is top notch. 

&nbsp;

**Superheroes - Hench by Natalie Zina Walschots - 2.5 stars**

This was almost a DNF for me. There was nothing wrong with the writing really, but the main character is so unbearably insufferable, and so blatantly wrong in her logic and motivations. It’s perfectly possible to write a main character who is also a villain, but you must give them some quality for the reader to latch on to. And what the hell is up with her last name being ‘Voldemort’ backwards? It’s never mentioned in the story, and it sticks out like a sore thumb.

&nbsp;

**Bottom of the TBR - Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan - 4 stars**

Had this one knocking around for years, and this square was the chance I needed. It’s barely fantasy, having more of a fantasy feeling than any fantasy elements, but it just feels close enough to include. I enjoyed it a lot. I’ve got a real soft spot for anything that makes it feel as though the real world might be just a bit more magical than it seems.

&nbsp;

**Magical Realism OR Literary Fantasy - The Golem and the Jinni by Helene Wecker - 5 stars**

Fantastic. Truly magical in the very best way, and my only five-star rating in this year’s bingo period. The perfect example of something that I would likely never have got round to if I hadn’t wanted it to fill a bingo square. It’s tragic, it’s funny, it’s heart-warming, and it’s just so magical.

&nbsp;

**Young Adult - The Sinister Booksellers of Bath by Garth Nix - 3.5 stars**

I’ve loved Garth’s books since I was a teenager. This particular series isn’t as strong as his Keys to the Kingdom or Old Kingdom series, but it’s still pretty fun, and all the characters are generally very likeable.

&nbsp;

**Mundane Jobs - At the Feet of the Sun by Victoria Goddard - 3.5 stars**

I wanted this to have such a higher rating. I absolutely adored the first one in the series, and was so excited to read this continuation, but I found it really, really slow going. It wasn’t bad at all, but the changed dynamic between the two main characters wasn’t quite as enjoyable to me as in the first outing.

&nbsp;

**Published in the 00s - Blade of Tyshalle by Matthew Woodring Stover - 3 stars**

I really enjoyed the first book in this series. The concept was extremely interesting and the blend of sci-fi and fantasy together worked really well. This second book isn’t as strong. It just takes all the stuff from the first book and goes too far with it. There are still plenty of great moments, but they’re buried in a muddle of ideas.

&nbsp;

**Angels and Demons - The Dirty Streets of Heaven by Tad Williams - 3.5 stars**

In many ways this is fairly standard urban fantasy PI noir stuff. A gritty wisecracking protagonist, a complicated supernatural love interest, a couple of humorous sidekicks. It’s all there. Luckily, I’m a sucker for that kind of thing, and therefore this neatly hits that spot.

&nbsp;

**Five Short Stories - The Refrigerator Monologues by Catherine M. Valente - 4 stars**

Maybe I should have used this for the superhero square and skipped Hench. I got a lot more out of it, even if the individual stories do tend towards the tragic.

&nbsp;

**Horror - Nettle and Bone by T. Kingfisher - 4 stars**

I’ll admit that this is skirting on the very, very edge of being acceptable as horror. It’s not really that scary, but I’ve got no taste for the real spooky stuff, so this had to do. I’d heard a lot of good things about the author without having read any, and it was worth it. It’s a fairy tale but in the older sense, where things might just be a little bit darker than Disney would have you believe, and I suspect Kingfisher will make another appearance on a bingo card before long.

&nbsp;

**Self-Published OR Indie Publisher - The Stone Road by Trent Jamieson - 4 stars**

This was a pleasant surprise for me. It was one of the squares I was worried about finding a selection for, and then I stumbled across a recommendation for this, and realised that I’d read several of the author’s other books a few years ago and I remembered enjoying them. This one was no different. The story itself is good, but it’s the mood that really makes it. There are certain other books that I’ve read that have a similar sort of ‘dark dream’ atmosphere, and I usually enjoy them.

&nbsp;

**Set in the Middle East – The Stardust Thief by Chelsea Abdulla - 4.5 stars**

Really loved this one, and it’s another that I may never have read without bingo. Again, I think it’s more the mood that the setting invokes than anything else. Reading this just made me feel as though I was in the desert, surrounded by hot sand and magic.

&nbsp;

**Published in 2023 – Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh - 3.5 stars**

There’s a lot going on in this book, and in many ways it’s all a little bit Ender’s Game. I don’t mind issue driven spec fiction, and I’ve found myself drawn more and more to it over recent years, but this book tries to cram in a lot of issues, and it can at times get in the way of other things like character and plot consistency. It’s still decent though.

&nbsp;

**Multiverses and Alternate Realities – The Frugal Wizard’s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England by Brandon Sanderson - 3.5 stars**

I’m still not convinced that I haven’t rated this too highly. When I think over to the other Brandon Sanderson secret project books, this one doesn’t quite stack up as well. It’s not that it isn’t still fun, but I didn’t know how to put my thoughts into words until I read another review that called it “shallow”, and I think that’s it. Sanderson gets a lot of stick from certain quarters for his books using cool ideas and neat magic systems to cover up the lack of depth in certain areas, but I think this is the first time that I’ve actually felt it.

&nbsp;

**POC Author – The Space Between Worlds by Micaiah Johnson - 4 stars**

I think I liked this in the end, but it really took a lot longer than it should have. It’s weird that a book I’ve rated four stars could have been a DNF without too much difficulty. Multiverse stuff is always difficult because you’ve got to try and balance out making the other realities different and interesting without going over the edge into overcomplicated territory. In my opinion at least, it mostly manages it, but I can’t deny that there are a lot of wobbles along the way.

&nbsp;

**Book Club OR Readalong Book – Orconomics: A Satire by J. Zachary Pike - 3 stars**

This was a standard fantasy adventure story, which would be fine if I hadn’t been promised so much more. I’ll admit that maybe that’s my fault, but I’d read reviews and comments suggesting that this was the next coming of Pratchett, and that it was hilariously funny, but I just didn’t really find that. Even the actual economics stuff that the premise seemed to be based on only really crops up a little bit in background scenes. It just wasn’t what I was expecting.

&nbsp;

**Novella – This is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar & Max Gladstone - 4.5 stars**

This is one of those that will divide opinion massively. You can either get on board with poetic time travelling queer epistolary sci-fi romance or you can’t. Luckily, I’m in the former category. Lovely stuff.

&nbsp;

**Mythical Beasts – The Last Echo of the Lord of Bells by John Bierce - 4 stars**

The final entry in this particular series, and it delivers pretty much exactly what you need from a finale for this kind of series. There are big climactic battle scenes, there’s a fairly happy ending for most of your favourite characters, and plot threads get wrapped up whilst leaving the door open for some interesting developments in the future should the writer choose to return. There may have been slightly too much climactic battle, given that it makes up most of the book, but too much is better than not enough.

&nbsp;

**Elemental Magic – The Sword of Kaigen by M.L. Wang - 4.5 stars**

Another one from the recommendation list and boy did it deliver! These are only intended to be short reviews, but this is probably the book on this list that I could easily write a couple of thousand words about. It’s just crammed with interesting characters living in this absolutely vibrant world that is built on this crazy contradiction between the old and the new, between science and magic, between modernity and tradition. 

&nbsp;

**Myths and Retellings – In the Lives of Puppets by T.J. Klune - 4 stars**

This book won’t be a surprise to anyone that’s read any of Klune’s recent works. It’s very much of the same spirit as The House on the Cerulean Sea or Under the Whispering Door. If T.J. Klune is going to spend the rest of his career writing quiet, gentle, queer love stories that focus on found family and how to be human, honestly, I’m fine with it.

&nbsp;

**Queernorm Setting – The Endless Song by Joshua Phillip Johnson - 3 stars**

I enjoyed the first book in this series and expected the same from this second entry. I was a little let down on the front. It’s not that the book is bad, but it feels super rushed, whilst trying to introduce a lot of new characters and a whole new setting to boot. I feel like this should have been a trilogy, using this second book to introduce the new focal character, and then use the third to bring everything together, à la His Dark Materials.

&nbsp;

**Coastal OR Island Setting – Half a War by Joe Abercrombie - 4 stars**

Anyone can die. Anyone can get character development. Anyone can get their comeuppance. Joe Abercrombie is nothing if not consistent with his theming. This is supposedly YA, so it’s not as hardcore as First Law, but it’s absolutely got all his hallmarks. Grey grey grey.

&nbsp;

**Druids – The Moonday Letters by Emmi Itäranta - 3.5 stars**

I gave this a rating, but that was more of a formality. This was easily my hardest square to find a book for, and I eventually settled on this based on a recommendation on the list. This is a perfect example of one of those books where I can see that it’s good, I can see why people like it, and yet it just isn’t for me.

&nbsp;

**Featuring Robots - The Cybernetic Tea Shop by Meredith Katz - 4 stars**

Short and sweet. A super simple romance on the surface, but with a lot to say about humanity and what makes a person a person. 

&nbsp;

I'm not a fan of urban/supernatural stories - no guns, vampires, or werewolves. I've read and enjoyed these series:

* Realm of the Elderlings - Robin Hobb
* Night Angel - Brent Weeks
* Nevernight Chronicles - Jay Kristoff
* His Fair Assassin - Robin LaFevers
* Throne of Glass - like I need to say who wrote that series... (Sarah J Maas, just in case)

1710873950.0,Has tolerance for complex prose declined?,"In workshopping my book, *The Student Prince*, one thing I hear is that my ""sentences are too long"" or my vocabulary is sesquipedalian. (OK, no one really says ""sesquipedalian."") I'm wondering if this is a generational thing, and that millennials and Gen Zers have an aversion to subordinated clauses and compound adjectives.

As an example, here's a couple of random passages from Jack Vance, who I cut my teeth on:

&#x200B;

>“What are your fees?"" inquired Guyal cautiously. ""I respond to three questions,"" stated the augur. ""For twenty terces I phrase the answer in clear and actionable language; for ten I use the language of cant, which occasionally admits of ambiguity; for five, I speak a parable which you must interpret as you will; and for one terce, I babble in an unknown tongue.”

&#x200B;

>“If religions are diseases of the human psyche, as the philosopher Grintholde asserts, then religious wars must be reckoned the resultant sores and cankers infecting the aggregate corpus of the human race. Of all wars, these are the most detestable, since they are waged for no tangible gain, but only to impose a set of arbitrary credos upon another's mind.”

I can think of others from Fritz Leiber or Michael Moorcock, but I love Vance's prose. Yet, I can't help but think he'd never be published today.

So what do you think: has overall tolerance for more complex prose dropped over the years?

[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200658329)

 

*In the Shadow of Their Dying* is such an evocative title. It suggests a story that touches on themes of mortality. But whose dying the title refers to?

Well, everyone’s, of course. It’s Fletcher’s and Smith Spark’s book, after all. And if they specialize in anything, it’s in beautifully written death, chaos, and mayhem.

The narrative almost literally swims in blood and gore. In the hands of lesser authors, it could have easily turned into something gratuitous and over-the-top. Here, though, it’s visceral and immersive. Dark, but also sad, despite excellently timed moments of humor. And yes, somewhat over-the-top :)

The story takes place in a city under siege where the third-best (available) assassin, **Tash**, takes on a job to kill the king. Things go south when it turns out a demon named **Iananr** is guarding the king's chambers. Calling the demon bloodthirsty would be an understatement of the year. Yet, its chapters are poetically brutal and expertly written by Anna. Iananr's point of view is something else, a unique experience that takes you on a wild, gore-soaked ride. 

Tash’s POV carries Fletcher’s trademark dark humor and wit, and the combination of the two makes the novella a treat to follow. The pace is breakneck, and with everything constantly in motion, there's never a dull moment.

I won't dive into the plot or characters too much—it's a novella that zips by, and all the reveals come in due time. Suffice it to say that both authors have done a stellar job with the concept of the attacked city, and people acting petty for monetary gain despite their reality crumbling around them.

If you enjoy dark fantasy and concise storytelling, do yourself a favor and pick up this book. Just be prepared to see your “goremeter” explode.",Fantasy
