1615920895.0,"Hello fellow Horror readers, I've compiled a small list to give people an idea of other authors in the genre besides Stephen King. Hopes this helps newcomers and horror vets alike!","A lot of people get their first introduction into horror through Stephen King, and rightfully so. He's nicknamed (and literally) named The King. Most people know his classics and more, The Stand, The Shining, IT, Pet Semetary, Salem's Lot, Under the Dome, Revival, Needless Things, Duma Key, Carrie, Misery, etc.

But King is not for everyone. His stories are almost less horror, and more about great story-telling interwoven with horror elements. Also, his stories are also usually very long, and centered around fleshing out characters. I myself enjoy this, but I realize it's not everyone's cup of tea. People often want to know where else to look to explore other elements of horror and don't know where to begin, which often leads people to this sub for that very reason. With that said, here are some authors and/or books that I think anyone can find something from that they will enjoy.

&#x200B;

Grady Hendrix:  Grady Hendrix is a fan favorite because his writing style echoes horror-comedies (think the movies Dale & Tucker vs Evil or Shaun of the Dead).  The horror is certainly there, but its met with lighthearted moments and witty humor to not make it seem so heavy.  Three really popular books by him include, Horrorstor, My Best Friend's Exorcism, and The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires. As you can tell by the titles, there's a bit of a southern charm and comedy to his works. I personally really enjoyed SBCGTSV recently.

&#x200B;

John Langan: He is mostly known from his recent years hit,  The Fisherman. It's universally liked on here by most. His writing feels folksy mixed with Lovecraftian. A lot of his works have an 'epic' feel to them dealing with ancient topics. He's got a lot of older books as well as book collections. My favorite is his most recent, ""Children of the Fang."" If memory serves me correctly, it was voted as the top story collection for that particular year, and I can vouch it has something for everyone. If folksy/ancient/Lovecraftian stories are for you,  Langan will be right up your alley.

&#x200B;

Joe Hill:  If you ask some people, Hill is what you get when you mix a modern refined writing with older Stephen King in his prime. Or, if you've exhausted all of King's great books and are just looking for more in the style of King, Joe Hill is about as close to it as you'll get, and for good reason: He is Stephen King's son. His most famous books are most notably, NOS4A2, Heart-Shaped Box, Horns, The Fireman, or 20th Century Ghosts if you're looking to scratch that short story itch.

&#x200B;

Jack Ketchum: Ketchum has a reputation for gruesome horror, because sometimes it's actually based on reality, which makes it all the more terrifying. His most popular novel by far, is ""The Girl Next Door."" Other popular novels include: "" Off Season, Closing Time and Other Stories, Red, The Offspring, and The Lost"" . Give The Girl Next Door a try, and if it hits home, give his other works a shot as his prose is consistent throughout most of his works.

&#x200B;

Adam Nevill: This guy is an up and coming horror problem. This man is like Spielberg in his prime, just hitting home run after home run in horror novels. Some are stronger than others, and depending on your taste you may not like each and every one, but I guarantee at least one of his books will land in your favorites.  His popular ones include:  "" The Ritual, The Reddening, Apartment 16, Last Days, No One Gets Out Alive, Under A Watchful Eye, Hasty For The Dark: Selected Horrors, The House Of Small Shadows, and Lost Girl"".  He is very folksy and a lot of his books are consistent in this tone. My personal favorites are ""The Ritual"",  ""The Reddening"", and ""Last Days"".

&#x200B;

Richard Laymon: He's controversial. People some to love him or hate it. Master of horror, or weird perv. I'm one of the rare few who think he falls somewhere squarely between, and edges towards the master of horror when he's firing on all cylinders. He is the quientessential author of ""slasher movie formula written into book form"".  At his peak, his books are enthralling, stay with you, and are fun along the way. Do you enjoy Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street? If so, check out novels such as ""The Traveling Vampire Show"",  or ""The Woods are Dark"", or even ""The Island.""

&#x200B;

Laird Barron: Homie is weird. In the greatest way possible. If you like out there novels or short stories that push the boundaries of your mind in freaky claustrophobic ways, he's your guy. I don't know how else to describe his works other than a feeling of dread, and constantly feeling like something's off, even if nothing particularly is happening at that moment. I recommend his popular works: ""The Imago Sequence"" , ""The Croning"", and ""The Beautiful Thing that Awaits Us All"".  These 3 works should give you more than a solid idea of his style and if you should read further.

&#x200B;

Lastly, my personal favorite, Dan Simmons:  Simmons is a master writer, above all. He can write on any subject, any topic, any culture, and somehow make it seem like he's spent his whole life researching that one topic. His prose and storytelling are second to none, and he really has a plethora of books to choose from. Since I've read him the most, I'll expand a little more.  To give an idea,  his book ""Hyperion"", while not horror, still has horror elements, and is largely regarded among SciFi enthusiasts as one of the greatest works of the last century. It's an amazing read. It's about a group of strangers traveling to a strange world where danger awaits.

Do you like Historical Fiction?  Again, Simmons is your guy.  ""The Terror"" is about the 1845 expedition to locate the freezing NorthWest Passage. What could go wrong traveling on a wooden ship hundreds of miles away from civilization in a frozen ocean with a monster lurking from the depths while the crew slowly starves to death experiencing scurvy?

Did you LOVE It by Stephen King?  ""Summer of Night"" by Simmons is the closest thing you'll ever get. Seriously. If you enjoyed IT, give this one a go.

Do you love the thought of international conspiracies and vampires? Love longer books? ""Carrion Comfort"" by Simmons has what you're looking for. Did I mention I like Simmons?

&#x200B;

Lastly, stand alone books that are fan favorites:

""The Ruins"" by Scott Smith - Still the most dreadful book I've ever read. Maybe it was because I was younger and more impressionable, but this one stayed with me. A group of friends vacationing down south come across ancient ruins and figure out very quickly they shouldn't have trespassed. This book is filled with dread. It's never ending. It builds you up just to crush you.

""Bird Box"" by Josh Malerman - This book is what you get when aliens invade and if you look at them, you go crazy. What comes next is a woman navigating on a trek blindfolded while the aliens are amongst them.

""Annihilation"" by Jeff VanderMeer - Simply the closest thing you'll get to Lovecraftian Horror, constantly asking yourself, WTF is going on? Just read it if that's your thing.

""House of Leaves"" by Mark Z. Danielewski - This book was not my cup of tea. BUT, some people would rank this as #1.  It's a book within a book within a story. It's about a House that knows no limits or bounds. It's psychological horror. It's more an experience than it is reading a story. If the unknown scares you more than the known, this book should do you well.

""Head Full of Ghosts"" - This book is what you get when The Exorcism meets Mental Illness and you're left to wonder, which is it? Are they schizo? Are they possessed? Does the truth lie somewhere in between?  A real crowd pleaser.

Finally, if you've cleared out this entire list and are still left wanting for more, I suggest other legends like King.  Mainly,  Robert R. McCammon and Clive Barker. Check out Lovecraft if you've never read his works or thought of this as being dated. His works are timeless and still relevant to this day.  I hope this list gives people a foundation for other authors and books to take a deep dive into horror! Thanks for reading.

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow! I didn't expect to get so much feedback. Thank you all so much, I'm really happy this list helped some people! I typed this half awake and honestly forgot some stuff. Since it gained some traction I'll add a little more.

Shirley Jackson: This list was more focused on current/younger authors which is why I left Clive Barker, Robert McCammon, Dean Koontz, etc. off the list. But Shirley Jackson earned her rightful place among horror enthusiasts and her works have aged well. I recommend ""We Have Always Lived in The House"" and her absolute classic ""The Haunting of Hill House.""  I personally did not find them scary, but they are still excellent stories. 

Thomas Ligotti:  I haven't read anything by him but have heard mixed things from friends. He seems to be one of those you either love them or hate them type authors. I saw a few recommendations on here by users so you may check him out too! His popular works include ""Teattro Grottesco"" and ""The Conspiracy Against the Human Race"".  ""Songs of a Dead Dreamer"" is another popular one. 

Paul Tremblay: He's the author of the above recommended ""Head Full of Ghosts"". He seems to be the biggest hit or miss author on this entire sub.  I think this stems from his ambiguous nature in his endings. If you like closure in a book and don't like being left to wander a tad, you probably won't be a fan. He's a great storyteller and his books are more about the journey than the destination. ""Cabin at the End of the World"" is another popular book of his. 

Stephen Graham Jones:  I also have not read anything by him, but I have seen a lot of positive feedback on here about him and his latest work ""The Only Good Indians"" seems to be a hit. I've noticed it's one of those ""I didn't find it scary"" books that gets comments like that. A lot of people like him though, I unfortunately haven't read his works yet! 

&#x200B;

Finally, a few more books that I forgot to mention that the comments reminded me about:

""The Troop"" by Nick Cutter:  Brace yourself. If you like books that start off with a bang, this book is for you. It's not about character development, or romance, or anything other than telling a horrifying story. And once it starts it doesn't let up. It's basically ""Lord of the Flies"" mixed with a killer genetic worm that starts infecting hosts on an island. It's as gruesome as it sounds. 

""Devils Creek"" by Todd Keisling : If you like cults, and/or horror with religion and small creepy towns with hidden secrets, this is the one for you. It's the first novel I've read by him and was worth it!

I spent a long time going through various subreddits trying to find my next read, and there are so many subs that have an air of elitism to them. The main books subreddit is too big for anything useful, and many other genre subreddits seem to have a sense of ""You aren't a true fan if you like XYZ author"" or ""You should have *already* read that book. You're not a fan of the genre if you're reading it for the first time."" I don't like to call out subs, but the absolute worst of the worst is /r/readanotherbook, which is a subreddit entirely built around hating what other people enjoy. 

I came to this sub, however, and I haven't seen one single bit of hate towards redditors here. Hell, I get the impression that someone could post ""Hey guys, I've just finished reading R.L. Stein's entire collection, any recommendations?"" and y'all would *pile* on support.

If you say “well there aren’t going to be trigger warnings in real life,” let me explain this to you, you wouldn’t set off firecrackers near someone who has ptsd from a war would you? Sure they might hear a loud bang that triggers their ptsd, but if they can avoid having to go down that path and reliving their trauma, wouldn’t you want to help them avoid it? Especially if they asked you to help them avoid it? Same thing applies here. Some people’s pasts are more nightmarish than the books we read yet that was a reality. Sometimes when someone gets triggered, it can send them down a dark spiral which could end up in them relapsing, going into a depressive episode, or worse. So please respect people when they ask for books without said triggers, because it can mean so much to their health and well-being.",horrorlit

1606665946.0,Pet Sematary has one of the best endings of any horror story.,"Don't get me wrong: the rest of the book is fantastic too, easily one of Stephen King's best. The horrors the Creed family goes through are equal parts heart-wrenching and terrifying. A cursed burial ground that revives the dead as homicidal revenants may be fictional, but the pain of losing a loved one - especially a child - is all too real. King's signature prose makes Louis Creed's slow descent into madness both scary and depressingly real. Let's face it: if we were in Louis's shoes, how many of us could resist the urge to bring our loved ones back from death, no matter how much evidence is presented that doing so is a *really* bad idea?

And the ending. Holy fucking shit, that ending.

So by the end of the book, Louis has been forced to murder his own son Gage that he worked so hard to bring back to life, after said son brutally murdered his wife Rachel. Now completely cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, Louis concludes the problem was he just waited too long with Gage. If he buries Rachel right away, *surely* she'll be brought back good as new! So he proceeds to do just that, then goes back home to play some solitaire while he patiently waits...

*He did not turn around but only looked at his cards as the slow, gritting footsteps approached. He saw the queen of spades. He put his hand on it.*

*The steps ended directly behind him.*

*Silence.*

*A cold hand fell on Louis's shoulder. Rachel's voice was grating, full of dirt.*

*""Darling,"" it said.*

And that's all, folks.

After an entire book of horrific imagery, the fact that this final reunion between man and wife is left to our imagination is far more terrifying than anything King could've written.",horrorlit

It slows you down a little bit.” Earlier on, he used to pump out 2,000 words a day, but these days, he aims to write for about four hours each day and gets down about 1,000 words.

He described an example writing routine in a 2014 interview:

>*I wake up. I eat breakfast. I walk about three and a half miles. I come back, I go out to my little office, where I’ve got a manuscript, and the last page that I was happy with is on top. I read that, and it’s like getting on a taxiway. I’m able to go through and revise it and put myself – click – back into that world, whatever it is. I don’t spend the day writing.

1711661270.0,Male horror authors and sexually assaulting female characters,"Recently I have reignited my passion for reading and found that horror literature, more specifically haunted house/ghost horror, is my favorite. I have been getting increasingly frustrated because many times when I find a book that seems to fit my ideal sub genre, I read the book to find that the biggest “spook” of the story revolves around a woman being penetrated in some perverted way. To name a few examples, a young woman masturbating, a woman penetrating herself with a cross or some other weird object, hyper sexualization, anal penetration, mutilation of breasts, and most recently a statue of Jesus Christ on the cross with a boner falling off the wall and penetrating a woman to death (I wish I was kidding, if you know you know). Seriously , what is wrong with these authors? Do I need to buy only women’s books to get non sexual horror? Jeez.

# WHAT IS IT?

A joint effort between myself and u/Marin_Letarive, this is a list of 500+ books that are usually recommended in very commonly asked-for subjects. Do you ever wish you had a list of books to give the last six people who were searching for folk horror or books like Event Horizon? Now you do!

**This spreadsheet contains:**

\+ book title, author name, year published, format (ex: novel, novella, comic, nonfiction, etc)

\+ keywords to describe the main genre/tropes/authors (ex: folk horror, lovecraftian, haunted house, gothic, scifi, splatterpunk, ocean, space, etc)

\+ links to places where you can find the book online (Amazon, Goodreads, Bookshop.org, Project Gutenberg).

\+ a keyword library where you can learn more about keywords and find links to more information about hose keywords online, as well as example works.

This is not a complete or comprehensive list- we are adding to it regularly and **we want recommendations from you!**

# HOW DO I USE IT?

First, click that big beautiful link! The most up-to-date version of the spreadsheet will be available here, but we encourage you to make a copy of it for yourself for offline use and editing. It's easier to sort if you have your own copy.

**To browse for a certain subject, CTRL+F or COMMAND + F on desktop, or ""Find on Page"" on mobile. Type in your keyword- each instance of that keyword will be highlighted, and most devices will give you the number of books on the list that fall under that category.**

Use the keyword library for more information on keywords or if you want ideas to browse for.

There are 4 iterations of the main list, because we couldn't figure out how to allow non-editors to sort the list on mobile. Depending on the tab you chose, the list is sorted by BOOK TITLE, AUTHOR LAST NAME, YEAR PUBLISHED, or FORMAT! They are identical in content, just pick the one you find most useful. Want to read books published before 1980? Sort by year. Looking for anthologies, short story collections, or comics? Sort by format. You get the gist.

**Spoiler Policy:** This only applies to a *tiny* number of books on the spreadsheet, but keep in mind that some keywords can be spoilers. If a book's major plot twist is ""it was secretly aliens the whole time"", we will have the book tagged as Spoiler: Aliens, which **will still show up in your search for the ""aliens"" keyword.** If you'd like to avoid spoilers like this, I suggest searching for the keyword ""spoiler"" and reading all of those books without checking the keywords. There aren't many, and then you've covered your bases.

# HOW DO I ADD TO THE LIST?

Comment here, or directly message [u/werewolfmac](https://www.reddit.com/user/werewolfmac) or [u/Marin\_Letarive](https://www.reddit.com/user/Marin_Letarive) any additions and corrections! **We rely on community input**\- we compiled this list, but all of the books on the spreadsheet have been pulled from rec request threads here on [r/horrorlit](https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit). And we have not even come close to reading all these books ourselves, so keyword and author info can be spotty. If you notice anything missing, let us know. :)

**Please send us:**

📚 Book recommendations! *(please include the title, author, and at least one commonly requested genre, trope or keyword. ex: southern gothic, vampires, arctic/winter, haunted house, LGBT characters, etc)*

📚 Links to old request threads, especially if you find there aren't many examples of that type on the list yet

📚 Errors, improper keywords, typos, any mistakes

📚 Additional keywords for books and authors already included in the spreadsheet

# FAQ:

**Can this be open-edit?**

The list is currently only editable by myself and [u/Marin\_Letarive](https://www.reddit.com/user/Marin_Letarive). It might be open to public edit someday, but for now we are keen on avoiding misuse and vandalism, and we wanna wait and see how it goes. Please don't hesitate to comment or directly message us.

**It would be easier for me if you made the list \_\_\_\_\_.**

If you have any suggestions for ease of use, readability, etc., especially on mobile, share it here. We are still fiddling with it and we're open to ideas and changes. No garantee any one thing will change, but still, nothing's set in stone.

**You used the wrong gender/ethnicity/nationality for this author!** Or **You left it out completely!**

Feel free to let us know if we're missing important info! That goes for authors and if a book has LGBT+ characters. We have done our best to include keywords that we've seen explicitly asked for here, but we aren't familiar with every author ourselves. Also, please remember before you comment on this subject: 1) This is **not** a place for debate or discussion about identity keywords, full stop. 2) This spreadsheet is a tool for people to find commonly requested subjects. We use some umbrella terms to keep the spreadsheet practical and useful in addition to accurate.

**Who should I give my reddit awards to?**

I know this post will get the lions share of any awards/upvotes, but for whatever these reddit points are worth, please direct your updoots and cute awards to [u/Marin\_Letarive](https://www.reddit.com/user/Marin_Letarive) in the comments! She did all of the heavy lifting, the formula work on the spreadsheet and most of the formatting!

1609969181.0,Which one of you fucking perverts recommended The Marbled Swarm?,"So, this is the synopsis:  
  
*""The Marbled Swarm is Dennis Cooper’s most haunting work to date. In secret passageways, hidden rooms, and the troubled mind of our narrator, a mystery perpetually takes shape—and the most compelling clue to its final nature is “the marbled swarm” itself, a complex amalgam of language passed down from father to son.  

Cooper ensnares the reader in a world of appearances, where the trappings of high art, old money, and haute cuisine obscure an unspeakable system of coercion and surrender. And as the narrator stalks an elusive truth, traveling from the French countryside to Paris and back again, the reader will be seduced by a voice only Dennis Cooper could create.""*    

That synopsis did not prepare me for the most fucked up book I've ever read in my life. The Marbled Swarm is filled with so many disgusting sex acts that I felt shame from my cat while reading.

[The Devil Crept In by Ania Ahlborn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29430798) - A boy goes missing, but when he returns something is off. I'm a big Ania Ahlborn fan and while this isn't my favorite, it's still a creepy read.  
[Elder God Dance Squad by Carrie Harris](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58259114) - Doesn't that title intrigue you?? It is young adult, it is a bit silly, but the plot is unique and it was a pretty fun read.  
[Dead Inside by Chandler Morrison](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25760088) - Was warned that this was a gross read and I absolutely agree. Won't give too much away but necrophilia is the mildest thing in this book.  
[The Luminous Dead by Caitlin Starling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36117102) - Claustrophobic and intense with a small cast of conflicted and complicated characters.  
[The Girl Next Door by Jack Ketchum](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179735) - The worst part of this story is that it's actually not as bad as the real life event it's based off of, which is insane to me. Truly awful, will never read again, but it's great.  
[Sour Candy by Kealan Patrick Burke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27687495) - Lovecraftian short story with an interesting concept and very well written.  
[Rolling in the Deep by Mira Grant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23634011) - Looking for monster/cryptid horror? What about killer mermaids? If so, this is the book for you. Personally, I like this prequel more than Mira Grant's first book in this series.  
[The Siberian Incident by Greig Beck](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49089946) - Good almost alien like horror to read during winter.  
[The Book of Accidents by Chuck Wendig](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55782435) - I really liked this book. Some of the dialogue may be a little hokey but there's a solid story here and I ended up really caring for the main family  
[Reprieve by James Han Mattson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56554477) - There was a murder in a full contact escape room. We go back and forth in time to introduce and learn about all the characters, up to the event, and then past the event during the trial of the murderer. Interesting plot and great characters.  
[Slade House by David Mitchell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40611069) - Exciting, intriguing, mysterious haunted house story with a satisfying ending and a lot of fun twists along the way.  
[The Death of Jane Lawrence by Caitlin Starling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48915818) - Gothic horror that was surprisingly bloody and was constantly ramping up intensity. I didn't know what to expect going in and ended up loving it.  
[This Thing Between Us by Gus Moreno](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56269269) - Fascinating and fairly short so it was really hard for me to put down, kind of a paranormal thriller  
[Wanderers by Chuck Wendig](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32603079) - Huge, sprawling story that begins basically at the beginning of the end. You slowly get introduced to and get connected with the myriad of characters. Reminded me of The Stand. Great way to end the month.  
[Child of God by Cormac McCarthy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/293625) - Unrelenting, violent, and incredibly written story about a man descending into madness.

**5/5**

[Nightflyers by George R. R. Martin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67958) - Way more sci fi than horror but entertaining nonetheless  
[The Hollow Tree by James Brogden](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36187753) - Entertaining, fantasy horror, that tells multiple stories and has a satisfying ending that ties everything together.  
[Home Before Dark by Riley Sager](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50833559) - These types of horror thrillers are my guilty pleasures with a ton of twists and ""no wayyy"" moments throughout.  
[Joe Pitt Series by Charlie Huston](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21277) - Urban fantasy is one of my favorite genres and this was the first one I found that really went hard into horror. The series started off really strong but the last two books weren't amazing imo.  
[The Final Girl Support Group by Grady Hendrix](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55829194) - Another Grady Hendrix novel! If you're a fan of his, you'll enjoy this book.  
[The Hole by Hye-Young Pyun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31213272) - Touched on themes of loneliness, guilt, anger, and grief that made me feel uncomfortable and impotent.  
[Bone Harvest by James Brogden](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49866868) - Religious horror featuring cults and mystery. I really loved the characters in this one.  
[The Last House on Needless Street by Catriona Ward](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54621094) - These kinds of books are my guilty pleasure. I get the hate but I personally love stuff like this. Lots of twists and turns and weird things that you may or may not be able to predict. I definitely didn't figure everything out and that's another reason I loved it  
[The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon by Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11564) - I think King excels in making is characters so real and lovable and that's what I loved the most about this book.  
[The Lighthouse Witches by C.J. Cooke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57310655) - A mother loses 2 of her 3 children to suspected paranormal forces and we follow her in the past and her remaining daughter in the present. Loved this book and it caught me off guard so many times.  
[The Running Man by Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11607) - Fast-paced, action packed thriller about a dystopian type gameshow and a father risking his life to save his daughter's.  
[North American Lake Monsters by Nathan Ballingrud](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16057298) - Great short story collection. None of them are insanely creepy or scary and it's very different from Ballingrud's other short story collection, Wounds, but the writing is just soooo good.  
[The Big Meat by Carlton Mellick III](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53625392) - A giant kaiju dies after terrorizing America and now we follow the crew that goes inside the dead body to haul off the meat and clean the city. Amazing premise and a really fun read, and that ending... chef's kiss.  
[Unclean Spirits by Chuck Wendig](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15802893) - I love urban fantasy, I love stories with gods, I love stories with violence, and this had all 3!  
[Maynard's House by Herman Raucher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242692) - Gothic horror with themes of trauma and paranoia and isolation. Went into this completely blind and it honestly blew me away. It also had some genuinely creepy moments throughout.  
[Slewfoot by Brom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53856842) - I've been a huge fan of Brom since Lost Gods, and Slewfoot was an excellent take on witches.  
[Wounds by Nathan Ballingrud](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42299829) - Amazing, amazing collection of short stories. They're not all 5/5 but the one's that are (looking at you Visible Filth), are just incredible.  
[Break the Bodies, Haunt the Bones by Micah Dean Hicks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38393457) - Completely unique take on ghosts, fascinating premise, and great story overall  
[The Books of Blood, Volume 1 & 2 by Clive Barker](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49394) - Clive Barker is the GOAT, especially of short stories. Can't wait to finish the rest of the books of blood. There are stories that I don't think will ever get out of my head.  
[Geek Love by Katerhine Dunn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13872) - Dark and disturbing! We follow a carny family that breed their own exhibit of human oddities.

**Favorites!**

[African Immortals series by Tananarive Due](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41536) - Even though this is tagged as horror, I think it's wayyyy more fantasy/urban fantasy than it is horror. Regardless, I really enjoyed this series (liked the first half more than the second). The plot is fascinating and I love the way Tananarive Due writes.  
[Twenty Trillion Leagues Under the Sea by Adam Roberts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16281371) - This was a nonstop deepwater ride that continued to ramp up every single chapter. It is filled with claustrophobia, mystery, peculiarity and eeriness, characters you want to throttle and characters you are rooting for, and weird shit that just gets weirder and weirder. Bonus points for cool illustrations throughout.  
[Father of Lies trilogy by S. E. England](https://www.goodreads.com/series/198075) - Starts off by following an extremely disturbed and violent psychiatric patient. After years of deterioration, the psychiatrist decides to try hypnosis and unwittingly releases something evil.  This series is depraved, dark, twisted, and sick and each novel gets progressively worse and more compelling.  
[The Black Farm by Elias Witherow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35396201) - Bleak, depressing, and disgusting. On top of that, the fantastical world is all encompassing and utterly engrossing. Absolutely fantastic, highly, highly recommend.  
[Kaiju: Battlefield Surgeon by Matt Dinniman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48730899) - Horror LitRPG with giant kaiju like monsters, LOTS of gore, and solid pacing and storytelling. LitRPG is my guilty pleasure but I wasn't expecting this book to be so good.  
[The Blacktongue Thief by Christopher Buehlman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55077697) - Technically fantasy but definitely has themes of horror. Christopher Buehlman is so good at creating amazing worlds (as seen in Between Two Fires) and has such a compelling voice. This fantasy novel is gritty and all encompassing with a fantastic cast of characters and I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel.  
[Earthlings by Sayaka Murata](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50269327) - If you like my reviews, please go into this blind and just trust me when I say that this is absolutely fantastic! If you want a little more info: A truly fucked up tale about a girl turned woman who doesn't fit in society with themes of abuse told with the most stark language which makes the already over the top plot stand out even more.  
[Come Closer by Sara Gran](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220772) - Short and sweet possession novel. This is one of my favorites because of one part that **still** rattles around my head 9 months after reading it. I have had dreams about this one scene in particular.  

**Nerdy Data Stuff**

I really love reading and I track a lot of information on an excel about each book I read - more than just the title and author, things like demographic information about the author, publication date, genre and sub genre, and so on.

1677862268.0,I read 12 horror books in the past few months and here's a review of them all!,"Sorted lowest to highest:

**Title:** [Abandon by Blake Crouch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25410675)

**Oversimplified plot:** Everyone from a mining town mysteriously disappears and over a century later a group of people investigate.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child abuse, child death, domestic abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** Wind rips through the crags a thousand feet above, nothing moving in this godforsaken town, and the mule skinner knows that something is wrong. 

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** Way more of a thriller than a horror, that had a really fun build up filled with intrigue and mystery, but unfortunately ended with a fizzle.

---

**Title:** [Bad Cree by Jessica Johns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60839741)

**Oversimplified plot:** A young Cree woman has increasingly vivid dreams and goes back to her family to get to the root of the problem.

**Sub-genre:** Magical realism

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** Before I look down, I know it's there. The crow's head I was clutching in my dream is now in bed with me.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** Intriguing premise with lots of potential that unfortunately went in a predictable direction. Additionally, the pacing is slow - not bad, just slow which might throw people off because the summary definitely makes it seem this novel would be much faster paced. There were a lot of things I liked, as well. The authenticity of the big family loving and supporting each other while still holding secrets and tensions was real and refreshing. Overall, I liked this book and look forward to the author's future work.

---

**Title:** [The Taiga Syndrome by Cristina Rivera Garza](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41806245)

**Oversimplified plot:** A detective goes on a journey in the Taiga to look for a woman.

**Sub-genre:** Mystery, fantasy

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** That they had lived there, they told me. In that house, there. And they pointed it out with an apprehension that could easily be mistaken for respect or fear.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** ""Experimental"" is an adjective. That it is the same word I use to describe this book is not a lie. The author's use of language and prose is something I've never seen before. There's repetition of certain phrases and sentence structures in each chapter, the prose goes from a romantic flow to abrupt staccato jarringly. That combined with the setting of this book taking place in some unknown boreal forest makes this book incredibly atmospheric. There are commentaries on capitalism and misogyny and so much more that is reinforced with the use of fairy tales like Hansel and Gretel and Red Riding Hood.  
But everything, including the plot, the characters, the themes, takes a backseat to the language. The language is the star of this book. This is not for everyone. Despite its short length it was a long read. But it's beautiful. If you speak Spanish, get the Spanish version of the book for unique illustrations in each chapter which the English version unfortunately does not have.

**Title:** [Tell Me I'm Worthless by Alison Rumfitt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57307172)

**Oversimplified plot:** The trio's lives are irrevocably changed after spending a night in an abandoned house.

**Sub-genre:** Gothic

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** Author's content warning at the beginning of the book: >!Tell Me I'm Worthless is a book about two things, primarily, and those things are trauma and fascism. I thought it important to include a content warning here, at the start, to say that. In dealing with those topics, the novel covers racism, antisemitism, transphobia, rape (both in abstract and graphic ways), self-harm and suicide.!<

**Opening Lines:** Long after the House is gone, it's there.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Brutal, violent, and as subtle as a bear attack. The author delves into the world of fascism and transphobia and bigotry of all types and masterfully interconnects the horrors of hauntings and haunted houses to deliver the punch just that much more effectively. This was not an easy read but it was worth it.

---

**Title:** [The Spite House by Johnny Compton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784411)

**Oversimplified plot:** A family on the run is paid to stay in a haunted house.

**Sub-genre:** Gothic, paranormal

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child death!<

**Opening Lines:** The Masson House of Degener, Texas, was like the corpse of an old monster, too strange and feared for most to approach it, much less attempt to bury it. After all, it might be feigning death or dormant.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Big cast of interesting characters, interesting and compelling plot that differentiates it from your typical haunted house story, and fast-paced for it being a gothic. The best compliment I can pay: this is a slow burn that does not read like a slow burn. 

---

**Title:** [How to Sell a Haunted House by Grady Hendrix](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59414094)

**Oversimplified plot:** See title.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller, paranormal

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child harm!<

**Opening Lines:** Louise thought it might not go well, so she told her parents she was pregnant over the phone, from three thousand miles away, in San Francisco.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** How to Sell a Haunted House was less campy than I was expecting! It was still a lot of fun and humorous at times, but felt more like a straight-down-the-barrel paranormal horror thriller. What sets this apart, is the focus on the characters. Whether you like them or not, they feel like real people, and that always makes the story more enjoyable. The pacing overall was also done very well; everything was reading quickly and tension was there throughout. 

---

**Title:** [Zero Saints by Gabino Iglesias](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27230788)

**Oversimplified plot:** Fernando encounters gangsters that want his territory and besides the extreme violence and body modification, something is not quite right with them.

**Sub-genre:** Crime

**Bechdel Test:** Fail (1st person male POV)

**Trigger Warnings:** >!extreme violence!<

**Opening Lines:** I didn't hear those pinches cabrones coming. They cracked my skull from behind. Probably expected me to drop like a sack of hammers, but the blow came with too much power and not enough finesse. You can't just whack someone on the head and expect them to go down for good. Some folks have really hard heads. now I knew mine was, and I had my iPod to blame.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Violent, surreal, action-packed, and incredibly immersive - there's a lot to like about this novel. Also, tiene que hablar español para disfrutar esta novela al maximo si no necesita usar un chingo de google translate.

---

**Title:** [Full Immersion by Gemma Amor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60052495)

**Oversimplified plot:** A woman finds her own dead body and investigates.

**Sub-genre:** Science fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** Dear Sirs, It has taken me six months to write this letter.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** An intensely personal novel about the challenges of postpartum depression and constantly having your worth questioned. I find that usually sci-fi horrors end up having eyes that are bigger than their stomachs so to speak and the book never actually lives up to the premise. This is not the case here. The sci-fi aspect and horror weave together really well and serve to tell the story in a creative way. This is a novel that I can see myself thinking about long after I last read it. Gemma Amor is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors and I can't wait to see what else she puts out there.

---

**Title:** [Our Share of Night by Mariana Enríquez](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61111034)

**Oversimplified plot:** A boy and his father do everything they can to escape their family.

**Sub-genre:** Gothic

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child abuse (mental, physical, sexual), domestic abuse, suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** There was so much light that morning and the sky was so clear, its warm blue marred by a single white smirth, more like a plume of smoke than a cloud. It was already late and he needed to go and that hot day was going to be just like the next: if it rained and he was hit with the river's humidity and the stifling Buenos Aires heat, he would never be able to leave the city.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Incredibly written book with a fascinating plot. We follow Gaspar from childhood to young adulthood in this sprawling, genre bending book, and we frustratingly watch him grow not understanding what's happening to him and why he's so different. What we know that he doesn't is horrifying and unimaginable, and yet so secluded that it doesn't color the entire book with its fantastical and supernatural elements. We get lulled into a sense of normalcy while we're following Gaspar and his friends trying to live a normal life, and then, like a punch in the mouth, we're reminded what a horrifying world this truly is.  
My biggest issue with this novel is that there is a giant break in the middle of the book that goes on for about 20% of the book that shifts perspective. Even though it gives the readers more insight into this world, I feel it was largely unnecessary and really took me out of the story. Despite that, I think this is a wonderful story and the translation was done really well.

---

**Title:** [Jawbone by Mónica Ojeda](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44074748)

**Oversimplified plot:** What happens when a pair of students and their friends do increasingly dangerous rituals to their made-up god and an obsessed teacher struggles to maintain her sanity collide? Nothing good.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child abuse, incest, sexual violence!<

**Opening Lines:** She fluttered her eyes open, and in rushed all the shadows of the breaking day. Those voluminous stains - """"Opacity is the spirit of objects,"""" her therapist said - allowed her to make out some battered furniture and, farther away, a phantomized body scrubbing the floor with a hobbit mop.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Author's use of language is mesmerizing. The prose goes from lyrical to staccato depending on the character, depending on the plot. There are entire chapters consisting of a single character's soliloquy, there are chapters that are just quick back and forth and snappy dialogue, there are chapters with vivid and graphic details with little to no dialogue; but I never once found it pretentious or overbearing. This is translated from Spanish and I think the translator did a wonderful job of maintaining the natural lyricality of that language. And I haven't even talked about the plot! It was just so weird in a very good way. I never knew where exactly the story was going, but I was never once disappointed. This is an absolutely fantastic read, and while it might not be for everyone, I highly recommend it.

**Title:** [We Spread by Iain Reid](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60209475)

**Oversimplified plot:** An elderly widow goes to long-term-care residence after a fall, and she slowly loses track of time and her agency.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** He was an artist. A prolific painter of merit and distinction. He impressed with his boldness and ingenuity. He liked to shock and bewilder. He refined this aesthetic of orderly, exaggerated confusion over many years.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Prose may be stark but the story is immersive. Partially because I am surrounded by older adults and adults with memory problems for my work, I found this book to be haunting and I could see so many of my patients in Penny, the main character. I found this story to be emotional and beautiful and I absolutely loved how so many different ideas (horizontal gene transfer, the Pando tree being connected, the passion for art and mathematics, just to name a few) are connected and pay off in very interesting ways.

---

**Title:** [Queen of Teeth by Hailey Piper](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58556306)

**Oversimplified plot:** Yaya starts experiencing inexplicable symptoms that may have been caused by a pharmaceutical corporation.

**Sub-genre:** thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!sexual violence!<

**Opening Lines:** She should never have come.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** A wonderfully grotesque novel with incredible imagery and a breakneck pace, that is ultimately about the power that is often stripped from women. This novel left me feeling equal parts enraged and invigorated.

1665598731.0,whoa. what's with all the pedophilia/incest?!,"While yes it is in fact horrific, it's not exactly what I had in mind when I read horror! I've read 10 horror/true crime/psychological thriller books for October so far and 7/10  had pedophilia/incest/rape/sexual assault  involved... I'm not even 2 weeks into the month I'm not sure I can take any more. 

Can you all recommend horror that doesn't involve rape or molestation? 

I liked: 
Tender is the Flesh;
Bunny;
Slewfoot;
Rock Paper Scissors;
The Five;
The Hunger;
Devil in The White City 

Didn't like:
Heart shaped Box;
Lapvona

Edit: Horror/mystery/thriller books I read in October

My star rating and SA content 

DNF = did not finish

Slewfoot by Brom: 4/5 stars. Interesting take on witch/devil relationship in puritan village. No SA

Devil in the White City by Erik Larson:  4/5. True crime. Chicago World's Fair is the backdrop of America's first serial killer. Creepy dude. Manipulative but no SA. 

The Five by Hallie Rubenhold: 5/5. True crime. Book was so good. Made me so angry. The lives of Jack the Rippers victims (not about the crimes or him at all). About the women's lives from their birth till their deaths. Three were never prostitutes. Of the two that were, one wasn't at the time of her death. What they had in common was they were destitute and sleeping outdoors! There is SA because life sucked for women but it's not graphic. 

Bunny by Mona Awad: 4/5. So bizarre but in a fun can't stop thinking about it way. No SA. 

The Earthlings by Sayaka Murata. 3/5. Graphic SA pedophilia, multiple times and verbal child abuse. I was completely unprepared. The book is about a girl who thinks her toy hedgehog talks to her and is an alien and she won't conform to social norms. It's bizarre but then there's this horrible SA and abuse.

The Woman in Cabin 10 by Ruth Ware: 3/5. I liked her writing. I thought the story wasn't the best. I like the way it was crafted though. I hope to read other books by her. No SA. 

The Hunger by Alma Katsu. 4/5. So good! Fictionalized retelling of the Donner Party. There is off-page SA that happens (adult to minors) the teens talk about it briefly. Oh and one character is a victim of incest (off-page) - plot point is integral to another characters story. 

Heart Shaped Box by Joe Hill. 1/5. I hated this book. I thought the characters were awful and plot just terrible. Repetative chapters. And incest/pedophilia.

Rock Paper Scissors by Alice Feeney. 5/5. Loved this book. Best one of hers I read so far. Kept me guessing. No SA. 

Final Girls by Riley Sager. 3/5. It was good, but not great. It actually reminded me of The woman in Cabin 10 a little. I do think there writing was good and that I'd be interested in checking out other works to see if maybe they are better. No SA. The sex in the book is consensual. Though there is deceit.

Final girl support group by Grady Hendrix. DNF. I really wanted to like this book. I love the movies the main characters are based on, but didn't really see the characters in them. It was too campy, I wish the book was a bit more serious and not so much like the movies. Also it was weird that some characters were the names of the actresses that played them but others weren't, felt inconsistent. 

Mindhunter by John E. Douglas and Mark Olshaker. 3/5. True crime. I understand that the point of the book is not to teach the reader how to be a profiler. The book felt a little too vague at times though as to how they came to certain conclusions about the suspects. I found that very annoying. Also lots of details about Douglas and his life which I realize are in the Netflix show but didn't realize are actually in the book itself. Was cool in the show but didn't care so much to read in the book. Of course there is SA in the book, it's about serial killers who are gross and often commit SA. But it's factual not overly graphic.

The Library of Mount Char by Scott Hawkins. 4/5. This book is so bizarre but wonderful. The character Steve is the best. It's got a beauty and humanity to the story. It is a bit bittersweet and sad. And there is a character that is a rapist and SA occurs (mostly off-page, but partial flashbacks on page) The adoptive parent is also abusive. 

His & Hers by Alice Feeney. 4/5. Good whodunnit. But there is SA and one character gets gang raped. It's awful.

Sandman Slim by Richard Kardrey. 3/5. Ehhh. Had a bit of b&w movie detective feeling to it. A little slow moving though. Wish it was better. No SA

Year of the Witching by Alexis Henderson. 4/5. This book actually reminded me of Tasha Suri's Empire of the Sand, except with like a polygamist puritanical cult with witches instead of Indian magic. There is off page previous SA of a minor. 

Horrorstor by Grady Hendrix. 3/5. This was a cute book. I almost want to give it 4 stars. The story was okay, I'm not sure I like his writing style. But no SA! 

I'll be gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara. 4/5. True crime. Serial rapist, so contains SA. Worth reading, but creepy and upsetting. 

7 1/2 Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton. 5/5. This book was so good. What an amazing writer. One character is a rapist but no SA happens in the book. 

The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks. 3/5. Almost want to give this one 4 stars too. Unsettling story in the way that it's meant to be. No SA. But I think what the dad did definitely counts as abuse.

Sometimes I Lie by Alice Feeney. 3/5. My least favorite Feeney book so far but I still think she's an amazing writer. An off page SA and an on page SA. 

Lapvona by Ottessa Moshfegh. DNF. Graphic rape. But from the POV of the rapist who didn't see it as rape. There were other upsetting things but after this I Couldn't read on.",horrorlit

*Essentially, these are the horror stories that were nominated for and/or won horror awards, OR were considered in that vein by readers.*

One website that might be overlooked by folks is Worlds Without End, which (fantastically!) lists ALL award-winners and nominees (going back decades) for science fiction, fantasy, and horror in one convenient place:

http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_index.asp

For the above site, you should be eyeing these major horror awards:

- Bram Stoker Award

- Shirley Jackson Award

- August Derleth Award (British based)

- Aurealis Horror Award (Australian based)


Additionally, they have a section titled ""Award Worthy Novels"" (hence where I got my idea) that has more underrated/ under-known novels as well, which is in my opinion a fantastic resource:

http://www.worldswithoutend.com/lists_awardworthybooks.asp?genre=H&awyr=2019

Furthermore, what has long been a mostly SciFi awards, the Locus Awards have (again) started awarding the Locus Award for Best Horror Novel as of 2017:

https://www.sfadb.com/Locus_Awards_2019

World Horror Grandmaster Brian Keene and Wrath James White also starting the Splatterpunk Awards to honor superior achievement in the sub-genres of Splatterpunk/ Extreme Horror fiction, beginning in 2018:

http://file770.com/tag/splatterpunk-awards/

Of course, there is also the Goodreads award for horror, so I have taken as many horror novels from their yearly award winners as I have the patience to write down (usually the top 10 or so).

https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-horror-books-2019

I also skimmed plenty of ""Best of 201X"" lists to make sure I didn't miss anything, such as:

1695314752.0,Do books genuinely scare you? What's the last book that did?,"It's been a long time since a book actually scared me. I don't know if it's just because I'm getting older or I've become desensitized or what. But no book has really gotten under my skin in years. Some books have scenes that creeped me out, like The Stand and Let the Right One In, but they don't stay with me in the days after I read them and make me jump at every little sound I hear. They don't make me paranoid that maybe that pile of clothes in the darkest corner of my room at night is really a demon waiting for the perfect opportunity to steal my soul. The last book I read that did that was The Exorcist around 2015. Since then I've read countless horror books including ones I've seen recommended here many times. (I just finished The Last Days of Jack Sparks and thought it was ok. But it didn't creep me out at all.) I don't think I've lost the ability to be scared because some horror movies can still scare me. I just haven't found any books that can. Does anybody else have this problem? Am I doomed to unsuccessfully chase the horror high for the rest of my life?

Edit to add: Holy shit, I've never gotten so many responses! You guys made me remember that there are many different ways to enjoy horror. I'm probably never going to be affected by a book like I used to be (although I still hope I will one day), but I can still get creeped out enough to make sure my third floor windows are locked at night (thanks, Dracula), I can still get disturbed, I can still be entertained. I love horror because there are so many different types and everybody is scared by something different. It's so interesting to read through your responses and find out how different people are affected by different tropes.",horrorlit

1669911983.0,I read 13 horror books in November and here's a review of them all!,"Sorted highest to lowest:

**Title:** [Walking to Aldebaran by Adrian Tchaikovsky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42201505)

**Oversimplified plot:** Mysterious entity appears in the solar system; humanity rallies together to investigate.

**Sub-genre:** Science fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Cannibalism!<

**Opening Lines:** Today I found something I could eat *and* something I could burn to keep back the darkness. That makes today a good day.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** How is this book not mentioned every single time someone asks about sci-fi horror?! I absolutely loved this book. It's a little bit funny, a little bit ridiculous, a little bit wild, and a lotta bit entertaining.

---

**Title:** [Fairy Tale by Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60177373)

**Oversimplified plot:** Charlie forms an unlikely friendship with an old man and his old dog, only to find him harboring some serious secrets.

**Sub-genre:** Fantasy

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** Does the dog die??? >!Nope.!<

**Opening Lines:** I'm sure I can tell this story. I'm also sure no one will believe it. That's fine with me. Telling it will be enough. My problem - and I'm sure many writers have it, not just newbies like me - is deciding where to start.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Couldn't put it down. Compelling characters that I'm gonna miss now that I've finished, wonderful fantasy world, and beautiful illustrations at the beginning of every chapter.

---

**Title:** [A View from the Lake by Greg F. Gifune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1191296)

**Oversimplified plot:** Is insanity contagious?

**Sub-genre:** Maybe paranormal? 

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child death, sexual assault!<

**Opening Lines:** She saw them only in dreams now. A young Japanese couple, the man tidy and stoic, the woman - his wife - petite and unassuming, a quiet sensuality concealed just below her studied exterior. Still as sculpture, the man would stand with his head bowed but eyes lifted, peering.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** I think Gifune is my favorite author. This is the fourth book of his I've read and I loved it. This is the kind of author that makes me want to write. As for this book: Gifune doesn't do much handholding. There isn't a bow at the end of the story with everything perfectly explained and put in its place. But that is one of the reasons I find this story so compelling. The story is eerie and emotional, and packs a punch for being a fairly short book.

---

**Title:** [The Maw by Taylor Zajonc](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35883130)

**Oversimplified plot:** Caving trip goes very, very wrong.

**Sub-genre:** Science fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!cannabalism!<

**Opening Lines:** The Land Rover bucked along the washboard road, plumes of fine dust and scrubby green trees rising in sharp contrast to the impossibly blue African sky.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** There is a lot going on for what I thought was going to be a fun ""caving gone wrong"" type of popcorn read. There are like 4 or 5 major threats lol. It worked for me! It felt like I was thrown into this giant adventure that I didn't want to end. If you're craving a claustrophobic, expeditionary group gets lost/trapped in a cave type read this will satisfy you and then some.

---

**Title:** [Ghostwritten by Ronald Malfi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60686837)

**Oversimplified plot:** The Skin of Her Teeth: Cursed novel. The Dark Brothers' Last Ride: Cursed novel. This Book Belongs to Olo: Cursed clown. The Story: Cursed media.

**Sub-genre:** Short stories; books about books

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Gore!<

**Opening Lines:** ""We've got a problem."" said Jack Baer. They were the first words out of his mouth, even before he sat down at the table.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Ronald Malfi is one talented author. All these stories were smart, gripping, fun, and creative. The final one (The Story) was a stand out for me, but they're all pretty good. 

---

**Title:** [Ghost Eaters by Clay McLeod Chapman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60095973)

**Oversimplified plot:** Drugs are bad, mkay?

**Sub-genre:** Paranormal

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child death, suicide, toxic relationships, drug addiction!<

**Opening Lines:** Tripping our asses off in the cemetary is Silas' idea. We dose back at the dorm to give the acid a headstart. By the time we abandon campus and hop the rod iron fence surrounding Hollywood cemetary, the four of us are well on our way to peak fry.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Hits on big topics like addiction, codependency, and grief while delivering some genuine scares. There were certain topics that I wish were fleshed out more, certain transitions that I found a abrupt, and even some questionable character choices, but this book had so many legitimately frightening scenes that it overcame a lot of its shortfalls.

---

**Title:** [Unidentified by Michael McBride](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38310393)

**Oversimplified plot:** ALIENS

**Sub-genre:** Science fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child death, parental abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** Three words.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Short and sweet novella that used the switching back and forth in time to keep the tension high until a pretty satisfying finale. Some of the characters are a bit flat, but others are very well thought out. Fantastic novella that you can easily finish in one sitting.

---

**Title:** [White Horse by Erika Wurth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60652964)

**Oversimplified plot:** Urban Indian woman finds a cursed family heirloom.

**Sub-genre:** Paranormal, mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!drug/alcohol abuse, sexual assault, domestic abuse, incest!<

**Opening Lines:** There was something strange, mysterious even, about the White Horse tonight. Normally, it was merely an Indian bar. My Indian bar. But there was a milky, dreamy quality to the red lights swinging over the pool tables, like the wind from the open doors was bringing them something new, something I'd pushed away for as long as I could remember.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This is a little bit of a ghost story, a little bit of a mystery, but mainly about the demons of a young Indigenous woman's past. I really liked the honest and captivating portrayal of urban Indians, as well as the growth so many characters showed in a fairly small amount of time. Dark tone + sarcastic MC = biting and gritty story, overall. Also, this was one of the few books I've read that captured a specific kind of domestic relationship without pigeonholing the characters.

---

**Title:** [Wayward by Chuck Wendig](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59575941)

**Oversimplified plot:** Sequel to Wanderers; what happens after the end of the world where the supposedly ""right"" people are saved by an AI entity?

**Sub-genre:** Post-apocalyptic

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!sexual assault, animal cruelty!<

**Opening Lines:** The president of the Unnited States of America sat at his desk in a dim, octagonal room lit by light sin the floor. His desk was spare. It contained no books, for he was not a curious man. It contained no papers because what could he possibly have to sign now, after everything? There was a pen holder, a flat piece of wood with a soft trench where a single pen could neatly rest. A plaque detailed its history: The holder was a gift from British prime minister Declan Halvey and had been taken from the hull of the HMS Gannet, an anti-slaver ship from the British Navy.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** I'm conflicted on this one. On one hand I think this is extremely long and an unnecessary sequel. On the other hand, I enjoyed reading it. Lots of POVs, lots of characters, a wild plot, and a satisfying ending. If you're extremely curious about what happens to the world after Wanderers, you'll like this book. If you were happy with how Wanderers ended, like I was, it's kind of a hit or miss.

---

**Title:** [Nana by Brandon Massey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39666861)

**Oversimplified plot:** Something's not right with Monica's birth mother.

**Sub-genre:** Paranormal

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!sexual assault, dog death, adultery!<

**Opening Lines:** As soon as Lily Worthy arrived home that Wednesday night after Bible study, she knew something was wrong.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** This is a quick and easy read with a handful of frightening passages. The plot is immediately predictable and I didn't like how they portrayed a specific character's action. But overall, I had a fun time.

---

**Title:** [Ancient Enemy by Michael McBride](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20742667)

**Oversimplified plot:** While Sani is struggling to care for his family and farm, something is brutally killing his livestock.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Animal death, alcoholism, parental abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** My blood has flowed through this valley for more than seven hundred years, a blink of an eye to the frigid river through which I splashed on my pinto mare, Yanaba. It was her restless whinnying from the stable that awakened me and alerted me to the fact that something was wrong.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** I was really struggling to figure out why I didn't like this book more because it has everything I'd want in a cryptid thriller, and I think the main reason for me is the motivation of the antagonist and how the communication is handled (don't want to spoil it too much) is lacking. Overall, still enjoyable and an interesting depiction ancient culture and the life of a young Navajo adult living on a farm in the reservation.

---

**Title:** [Extant by Michael McBride](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57869950)

**Oversimplified plot:** Archaeological dig gone wrong

**Sub-genre:** Thriller, cryptid

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** Didn't catch any major ones.

**Opening Lines:** The makeshift windbreak snapped on the gusting wind. Sand struck the tarps draped over the aluminum framework like buckshot and cascaded down into the excavation, where Rana Ratogue brushed dirt from the seams between basalt blocks.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** Strong start, middling second half. I was very excited about the set up with all the talks about Egyptian deities, but it ended up turning into a generic monsters vs. human story.

---

**Title:** [The Hacienda by Isabel Cañas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57840571)

**Oversimplified plot:** Haunted house story after the Mexican War of Independence.

**Sub-genre:** Gothic

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!implied sexual assault!<

**Opening Lines:** The low sweep of the southern horizon was a perfect line, unmarred by even the smudge of horses tossing their heads in the distance. The road yawned empty.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** This is a good book but not what I like to read. This is less of a gothic horror and more of a forbidden romance with a dash of horror. Despite me not liking romance, I enjoyed myself, and found it to be well-written.

1652411333.0,I went into Stephen King expecting a more R.L Stine level of horror. Boy was I wrong,"Not sure why, but I’ve always interpreted Stephen King’s horror as sort of “mild”, sort of like R.L Stine. Something that’s scary but not in an intense or disturbing way. I saw Children of the Corn, saw most of Pet Semetary and saw “IT”. They were good but I never thought of them in the same way I think of a movie like “Halloween” or “Friday the 13th”. Not sure to explain it. The movies were still good, though, and led me to having an interest in what the books were like. I went into “IT” first. I’m around ~170 or so pages in and this book is highly, highly disturbing. I underestimated him severely. The way he conveys unpleasant imagery and the topics he touches on in the book genuinely terrify me. There’s absolutely no *boundaries* and it makes me afraid of what he’s gonna dare show next. The gore is also a lot to handle. At times I’ve had to put down the book for a minute or so just because the imagery was so realistic and intense. I read Books of Blood, Red Dragon, and Between Two Fires and they never disturbed me like this. Honestly scared to finish the book, but I’ll push through it.

Student and Pink Floyd-Fan becomes a teacher in a small village in the carpathians. There he falls in love with a woman and gets lured to join a ""unaussprechlichen Kulten"" with her.

**Expert**

1.	Alectryomancer and Other Weird Tales by Christopher Slatsky
2.	Noctuary by Thomas Ligotti
3.	 Peace by Gene Wolf (it’s closer to a literary ghost story, but some people argue it’s a horror book diguised as sci-fi)

1619230809.0,"A look at Dean Koontz's writing routine: “On good days, I might wind up with five or six pages of finished work; on bad days, a third of a page.""","When Koontz is working on a novel, his typical schedule has him writing for long stretches, six days a week. “I work 10- and 11-hour days because in long sessions I fall away more completely into story and characters than I would in, say, a six-hour day,” he explained.

“On good days, I might wind up with five or six pages of finished work; on bad days, a third of a page. Even five or six is not a high rate of production for a 10- or 11-hour day, but there are more good days than bad.”

Koontz used to write outlines for his novels, but after he “decided to wing it” with his 1986 novel, Strangers, he discovered it was the “best decision” for him, and hasn’t used outlines since. “I start with a bit of an idea, a central theme, a premise, and then I think about it for a little while — not for weeks and months, but days — and then I begin,” he explained.

He also doesn’t use the internet, afraid of it’s time-sucking abilities. “E-mail can eat you alive, which is why I didn’t even have it until about three years ago,” he revealed. “And I never go on-line for research. I leave that to an assistant, because I have seen more than a few writers waste endless hours on-line.”

**Title:** [Monster Hunter International by Larry Correia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2570856)

**Oversimplified plot:** Monsters are real and there are agencies to deal with them.

**Sub-genre:** Urban Fantasy

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Content Warning:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** On one otherwise normal Tuesday evening I had the chance to live the American dream. I was able to throw my incompetent jackass of a boss from a fourteenth-story window.

**Rating:** 1/5

**Review:** This novel had the potential to be a very fun, turn-your-brain-off kind of read with violence and humor and monsters. But it was so hard to get past the awful ""romance"" throughout which is just pure fantasy wish fulfillment - the ugly guy falls head over heels with a pretty lady who has a very attractive but asshole boyfriend and eventually the ugly guy wins her over. This was like 40% of the book!  Yeesh, this was tough to get through.

**Title:** [The Insatiable Volt Sisters by Rachel Eve Moulton](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784691)

**Oversimplified plot:** The Volt sisters are forced to return to the island where they grew up to face something from their family history.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warning:** >!suicidal ideation!<

**Opening Lines:** My earliest memories in the house on Fowler Island are of the girls - Henrietta and Beatrice - their carnivorous joy echoing off the walls of Quarry Hollow.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** This novel is basically mild magical realism meets family drama with sparse sprinkling of horror. We're going back and forth in time from 4 POVs and it just feels like so much is going on but nothing is actually happening. This was not my cup of tea and I was a bit bored for a majority of the book.

---

**Title:** [A House with Good Bones by T. Kingfisher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784409)

**Oversimplified plot:** When Sam visits her mother in her old childhood house, something is off and has her mother acting not like herself.

**Sub-genre:** Gothic

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warning:** n/a

**Opening Lines:** There was a vulture on the mailbox of my grandmother's house.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** The plot, although different from most standard gothic works, was still immediately predictable. The characterization, while fresh and fun, did not fit a horror novel. The way the characters talked and acted, I immediately knew there were no real stakes here and it was going to be a fairy tale happy ending. Nothing wrong with that, but I don't want to be able to easily guess that in the first couple chapters of what is supposed to be a horror novel. Overall, I'm a big fan of Kingfisher's writing style, but this one didn't quite work for me.

---

**Title:** [All Hallows by Christopher Golden](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784620)

**Oversimplified plot:** Halloween in 1984 and something is not right in this small neighborhood.

**Sub-genre:** Halloween... is that a subgenre? I guess maybe paranormal?

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warning:** >!infidelity, domestic abuse, child (teenager) death!<

**Opening Lines:** In the woods behind Tony Barbosa's house the autumn leaves screened out so much daylight it seemed like dusk had already arrived.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** I thought I was reading a telenovela for the first two thirds of this book; there was so much drama and gossip and infidelity and family dysfunction. It kept me on the hook, but not for the reasons horror novels typically do. When the horror finally began and things took off (and they really took off!), it wasn't enough and I wanted more. If the length of the set up and the pay off would have switched, this would have been an easy favorite and October reread for me.

---

**Title:** [Episode Thirteen by Craig DiLouie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61030527)

**Oversimplified plot:** Ghost hunters be ghost hunting.

**Sub-genre:** Paranormal

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warning:** >!child abuse, domestic abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** Hi, I'm Matt Kirklin, paranormal investigator. Welcome to my bio.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** If you are a fan of horror documentaries a la Hell House LLC or Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum or even As Above So Below, you will probably really like this book. Personally, this novel had 2 big things that I don't generally like: told completely in an epistolary style and a book that seems like it's a movie in written out form. Despite that, I was still very entertained throughout, but those hurdles, especially the latter, are very hard for me to overcome.

**Title:** [Gothic by Philip Fracassi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59909683)

**Oversimplified plot:** When is a desk not a desk? When it's ~~ajar~~ an ancient altar used for ritualistic human sacrifices.

**Sub-genre:** Gothic

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warning:** >!graphic sexual assault, child death, suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** Diana Montresor opens her laptop, punches in a password to reveal the home screen, and brings up her mail program.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** This novel is filled with a lot of things I enjoy in horror - a quick and visceral descent into madness, brutalitiy and violence, and most importantly, vivid and horrific scenes that stick in your head. However, one of my biggest issues is that the dialogue and prose is reminiscent of Stephen King's - to the point of distraction.

---

**Title:** [Curse of the Reaper by Brian McAuley](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321221)

**Oversimplified plot:** Years after concluding his roll as the Reaper in an 80s horror franchise, Howard learns that a remake is being made with a young new actor set to replace him.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller, slasher

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Content Warning:** >!substance abuse, animal death, parental abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** ""What was your favorite kill?""

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:**  Very enjoyable, very fast paced slasher horror thriller with a good amount of pulp and satire that ultimately showed the love of this genre. It follows the major beats of a typical slasher but still has a life and personality of its own. 

---

**Title:** [Paradise-1 by David Wellington](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61634435)

**Oversimplified plot:** Something goes wrong on a flight to Earth's first deep-space colony.

**Sub-genre:** Science fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warning:** >!suicide, parental abuse, cannibalism!<

**Opening Lines:** Three days still before dawn on Ganymede, and the cold seeped right through her suit and into her bones. The only light came from what reflected off the crescent of Jupiter, a thin arc of brown and orange that hung forever motionless in the night sky.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Nonstop joyride at a breakneck pace, this novel is endlessly entertaining. I loved the twists and turns throughout, I loved the humor sprinkled in, I loved the characters and their growth on this ridiculous journey. And to my surprise, I felt myself getting squeamish multiple times. But holy cliffhanger, batman!! 

---

**Title:** [And Then I Woke Up by Malcolm Devlin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693324)

**Oversimplified plot:** A disease has plagued the world. Is it causing the rise of the undead or only the perception of it?

**Sub-genre:** Science fiction, zombies

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warning:** >!child death!<

**Opening Lines:** Nobody wanted the room next to Leila's and it wasn't because when curfew came, she turned out to be a screamer. It was because she was silent.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** When I was a child, I had an irrational but deep seated fear that my waking life was a dream. I was terrified that one day I'd wake up and lose everything I had; all my relationships, all my talents, all my possessions would just be gone. This book reawakened that fear.

**Title:** [The Devil Takes You Home by Gabino Iglesias](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58978299)

**Oversimplified plot:** After being buried in debt because of his daughter's cancer, Mario takes more and more violent jobs.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Content Warning:** >!extreme violence, child death, domestic abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** Leukemia. That's what the doctor said.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Although violence is front and center in this novel, there are themes of injustice, grief, helplessness, and futility. On top of that, there is a subtle infusion of something sinister, something paranormal that slowly creeps its way up on the reader. This is a fantastic albeit heartbreaking novel.

**Title:** [Square³ by Mira Grant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58042549)

**Oversimplified plot:** The fabric of reality has ripped and the world as we know it has changed irrevocably.

**Sub-genre:** Science fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warning:** >!child abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** When the first holes ripped in the fabric of reality and the first interlopers appeared, looming out of the sudden unseasonable fog like mountains or wayward aircraft, no one knew what to expect. The world was not braced. There had been no warning -

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** This was such a creative novella. I absolutely loved the imagery; the descriptions of the rift and the creatures were vivid. Despite being science fiction and the main character being a scientist, the readers aren't inundated with scientific jargon; and the descriptions that are there serve the story. There were so many clever little things throughout from the chapter numbers being cubed to quips from the protagonist to decisions characters make to get themselves out of difficult situations. Despite being such a short book, the world was huge and it was a very fun read.

**Title:** [Briardark by S.A. Harian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62896564)

**Oversimplified plot:** A team of scientists get lost in the wilderness. A university IT worker discovers audio recordings of the team's journey.

**Sub-genre:** Mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warning:** n/a

**Opening Lines:** After everything Avery had been through, she wasn't about to die from some damn lightning bolt. Which meant she needed to get off this wet granite. Fast.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** This is an amalgamation of much loved tropes in horror: wilderness/survival + cosmic + epistolary style and I could keep going. I thought it would be distracting or that I would get lost following almost a dozen different characters in different time points, but the novel is so well-paced and the story is riveting and told really well. This novel ends on a cliffhanger, but even though I hate that so much in general, I don't even care because of how good this book is. I cannot wait for the second installment.

**Title:** [Lone Women by Victor LaValle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60460704)

**Oversimplified plot:** In 1915 Adelaide flees her home to become a homesteader in Montana. Unfortunately, the reason she fled never left her side.

**Sub-genre:** Historical fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warning:** >!child death kinda!<

**Opening Lines:** There are two kinds of people in this world: those who live with shame, and those who die from it.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Atmospheric, spell-binding; a fast read but filled with beauty. The plot is fascinating and based in little known history of black women homesteaders. Every character is unique and rich. There was an upkeep in tension throughout and the payoff is incredibly satisfying. I absolutely love this book.

1668198669.0,I finished Pet Semetary about a month ago and I still can’t stop thinking about it,"Easily one of the most disturbing books I’ve read. King’s portrayal of grief and loss is so damn raw, it had me disturbed for days.

I genuinely can’t stop thinking about this book and it’s still freaking me out!

1653694333.0,There are scenes in Dracula that are still chilling today,"It’s pretty amazing that *Dracula* is still so effective as a horror novel. Not only is it old, but its villain and story have become such massive pieces of pop culture that you wouldn’t think they’d retain any power to scare. But as I’m reading through it again, there are a few specific scenes that still stand out to me as being particularly chilling. They’re all near the beginning, when Jonathan Harker is in Dracula’s castle.

• It’s very creepy when Jonathan first discovers that there are, in fact, no servants. It makes the castle feel even more isolated and dangerous, and also exposes the fact that the Count is lying to him for some reason.

• The scene where Dracula makes Jonathan write out future-dated letters is disturbing as well. At this point, the Count isn’t even trying to hide his intentions. Later, when the Count reveals that he’s received the letters Jonathan tried to send via the Romany men, he burns the one written to Mina in shorthand. I love the way the Count continues to speak courteously as he does this.

• The introduction of Dracula’s wives is very effective, as we realize that no place in the castle is safe from them except Jonathan’s room. We also see Dracula throw them a bag containing a baby to eat, which is just amazingly morbid.

• Who can forget the scene where Jonathan sees the Count crawling down the castle wall “like a lizard”? What an unsettling visual.

• Maybe the creepiest moment of all, for me, is when Jonathan discovers the Count in his coffin with his eyes wide open, with a “look of hatred” in them. Then, when he tries to attack the sleeping Count, he turns his face toward Jonathan and stares at him with those wide open, hateful eyes. This part makes my skin crawl.

• Finally, I absolutely love the scene where the Count pretends that he’ll let Jonathan leave, only to summon a pack of wolves to stand outside the door. Again, I love the Count’s courteous demeanor and the way he blatantly threatens Jonathan without actually saying anything overtly threatening.",horrorlit

**Title:** [Flowers for the Sea by Zin E. Rocklyn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57055809)

**Oversimplified plot:** Iraxi is going nowhere, surrounded by people she doesn't care for, and harboring something she wants nothing to do with.

**Sub-genre:** Fantasy, novella

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!unwanted pregnancy, subjugation!<

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Short but not sweet. Read this novella slowly and take your time to absorb the beautiful prose. I don't want to reveal much because the book is so short and I don't want to spoil anything. I will say that this book touches on themes of isolation and oppression but also of power and resiliency.

---

**Title:** [Stolen Tongues by Felix Blackwell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35524932)

**Oversimplified plot:** Worst buzzkill of a romantic getaway? Something spoopy in the woods.

**Sub-genre:** Supernatural

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!animal death!<

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Started off so strong with a genuinely creepy prologue. I think this will hit harder with those affected by sleep disorders. I liked a lot of things about this book, it had a lot of scary moments throughout, the things that happen to the female lead is nuts. I will say though, it's pretty obvious by the editing that this book started out as a creepypasta and was the author's first book. If you can get over some of those issues, this is a very enjoyable book!

---

**Title:** [Small Town Monsters by Diana Rodriguez Wallach](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56905125)

**Oversimplified plot:** Two kids team up against cults. Oh did I mention, one of the kids parents are demonologists? Also also, something weird is happening with the other kids mom.

**Sub-genre:** Young adult, paranormal

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!death, suicide!<

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** I like how the two main characters are different from each other but work really well together. In general, the characterizations are done pretty well. This book also hooked me pretty fast. I wasn't a huge fan of how it ended, but despite that and despite that this is pretty YA, I really enjoyed it. I'm also a huge sucker for culty stuff lol.

---

**Title:** [Salvation Day by Kali Wallace](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39918548)

**Oversimplified plot:** There's a deadly and mysterious virus on an abandoned spaceship, I wonder what happens next??? Oh yeah, they go right in and get all sorts of fucked up.

**Sub-genre:** Space sci-fi, thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Death of children (not described in detail), abusive authority figure!<

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** After a couple of space sci-fi horror duds, this book finally scratched that itch. It's by no means perfect; I think there's a specific ""B"" plot that could have been edited down, and I have a couple minor character gripes. But overall, I really enjoyed it and think it's definitely worth a read. It's entertaining and most importantly (to me at least) very satisfying.

---

**Title:** [Black Tide by K.C. Jones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55155522)

**Oversimplified plot:** A hot mess + a film producer + mansion on the beach + apocalyptic astronomical event = a really fun book.

**Sub-genre:** Science fiction, apocalypse

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!suicide, animal death!<

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Good character build up and a really fun concept. I love me a good sci-fi horror and throwing in an end of the world scenario makes it even better. If this were a movie it might be a syfy channel movie with a solid cult following, and I mean this as a huge compliment because I would watch the crap out of that movie.

---

**Title:** [The Mist by Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/813214)

**Oversimplified plot:** What happens when people walk into a mysterious fog? They will be mist.

**Sub-genre:** Supernatural

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!suicide, death!<

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** One of my favorite short stories/novellas of King. If you're looking for something fast-paced, that you can't put down, this is the book for you. Not much else I can say about King's work that hasn't been said a thousand times before.

---

**Title:** [Goddess of Filth by V. Castro](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55370887)

**Oversimplified plot:** Come on now, you know better to hold a seance and chant in Nahuatl. Look what happened to your friend! See what you did?

**Sub-genre:** Paranormal, novella

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!SA!<

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** A fresh take on a possession story, especially given the fact that the ""ritual"" is literally the opening paragraph of the book. I really liked how the author goes into the lore and there was attention paid to the characterization, even though it was a short book.

---

**Title:** [The Coma by Alex Garland](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/106373)

**Oversimplified plot:** Man gets KOed so hard he's in a coma.

**Sub-genre:** Mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!violence!<

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Short and weird and a very cerebral read. Have you ever had someone tell you about their dream? Wasn't it the most boring shit you've ever heard in your life? Imagine that but it's the opposite of boring and the person is a really good story teller. The big caveat here: even though it's tagged as horror, I didn't really see this as a horror book.

---

**Title:** [Psycho by Robert Bloch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156427)

**Oversimplified plot:** In case anyone has been living under a rock, Psycho is the story of this nice and just a little bit weird dude, Norman Bates.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller, classics

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!murder!<

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** BTW, I'm that person living under a rock because I have never watched Hitchcock's Psycho and knew very little about the plot of this story going in. That being said, it's so good! Like really, very good. The writing is just so neat and focused, not a wasted word. Highly recommend whether or not you've seen the movie.

---

**Title:** [When the Reckoning Comes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55425310) by LaTanya McQueen

**Oversimplified plot:** A black woman goes to the plantation wedding of her childhood friend. What could possibly go wrong?

**Sub-genre:** Mystery thriller, historical fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!rape, torture, murder, lynching!<

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Why would you ever have a wedding at a plantation?! Why, as a black woman, would you ever attend that wedding?! Well you'll understand why when you read this book. A great book that is uncomfortable to read but so very worth it. This book starts off almost like a slice of life story and then you start slowly feeling uncomfortable and that discomfort soon leads to outright terror.

---

**Title:** [Lapvona by Ottessa Moshfegh](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59693959)

**Oversimplified plot:** Living in a medieval fiefdom that's hit with famine and drought is so bad that the Zestimate on Zillow is only $1.8 mil.

**Sub-genre:** Historical fiction, Fantasy

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** I apologize if I missed any cuz this one's a doozy folks. >!Cannibalism, torture, incest, murder, pedophelia, abuse (child, physical, emotional, animal, and more), rape!<

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** This novel is unapologetically relentless. I loved every page of it. It's written wonderfully, it's bleak, it's heavy. It's filled with depravity but completely unlike any body horror I've read. It's because horror is not the point of this novel; it's a side effect. 

---

**Title:** [Comemadre by Roque Larraquy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17319107)

**Oversimplified plot:** Two interconnected short stories set 100 years apart; first of a brutal medical experiment and the second of an artist taking things to the extreme.

**Sub-genre:** Historical fiction, novella

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!medical gore, kinda necrophilia, body mutilation!<

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Absolutely incredible read!! Surprisingly creepy and atmospheric, unique narrative structure, fantastic plots, and it has stuck in my mind. It's also a really odd mixture of things being stated very dryly by the characters and overall tone of the book is vague and alluring. I highly, highly recommend this one.

---

**Title:** [Children of Chaos by Greg F. Gifune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6271322)

**Oversimplified plot:** All you need to know about this novel is the title and the opening line: ""We all stood there awhile and watched him die. 'I think we just killed God.'"" 

**Sub-genre:** Supernatural, demonic

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!murder, torture, self harm, drug use, incest!<

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** This is a great supernatural horror book pretty grounded in reality. Has its fair share of brutality and wonderful imagery. The pacing is also really solid; fast paced for the most parts with some lulls that build up characters, but that means the payoff is even better.

---

**Horror adjacent mentions:** 

[Life Ceremony by Sayaka Murata](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59793324). 5/5 Another banger by one of my favorite authors of all time. Love the prose, love the concepts, love everything about it. If you liked Earthlings or Convenience Store Woman, you'll like this book.

[Bullet Train by Kōtarō Isaka](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56969543). 4/5 Read the book and then saw the movie. Both are super fun, humorous, violent, and endlessly entertaining. This was also a fantastic palate cleanser in between some of the more heavier horror novels (looking at you Lapvona).

---

**Close but No Cigar**

[The Resting Place by Camilla Sten](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693360). 2/5 It spends time on each character, but they didn't draw me in. It has a main character with a very interesting disease that directly impacts the plot, but it was the weakest part of the story. Unfortunately, the plot didn't live up to the story.

[Lesath by A.M. Kherbash](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45173036). 2/5 I might be stupid but I didn't get it. I read and reread multiple parts of this book and I'm still kinda confused. I sat with it for a while, read other people's reviews, and still don't get it. The premise is very interesting and the story takes place in a kind of mental institute/prison with characters that don't know how they ended up there. I really wish I liked this book.

[The Orange Eats Creeps by Grace Krilanovich](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8075281). 2/5 The author is very talented and it's definitely a well-written book, but this is not for me. The focus is not on the plot at all and I'm honestly a bit of a plot hoe. If you're looking for a weird, cerebral, horror fantasy, this might be your jam.

1623364530.0,"Recent Mod actions, accountability, and new mod positions.","Hi all, 

I’ve been planning a community update for a while now and I’m sorry that recent actions by a member of a mod team being the thing that prompted me to make it. So out with the bad first:

Recently, as many of you are aware, there was a posting about Lovecraft in which commenters began to discuss Lovecraft’s **well-documented and irrefutable racism**. I won’t relay the play-by-play but one of mod team members u/CArnoldBarent began to censor and ban community members who expressed these facts. As well as making additional intolerable comments. Before they could be removed from the mod team they deleted their account.

u/GradyHendrix u/xorobas and myself want to make it extremely clear right now that u/CArnoldBarnet’s actions were wrong, inexcusable, and in no way tolerated in this community. We also wish to apologize to the community for not keeping a close enough eye on to end such things sooner. As many of you know the three of us have full-time careers and expectations that keep us from being able to fully watch over the community. More on that down below.

So, in regards to u/CArnoldBarnet’s actions I want to clarify a few things for this community:
1) This is a discussion based community. Everyone is encouraged to engage in appropriate discourse on any subject even taboo ones. However, the discussion must be appropriate, in good faith, and respectful. Using Lovecraft as an example; if you wish to create a dialogue regarding his racism you have that ability and your comments or posts will not be removed so long as you are respectful to others who engage with you on that topic. That said, it is within the mods rights to lock threads that we believe are no longer maintaining appropriate discourse or to remove threads or comments we believe are trolling or not being made in good faith.
2) u/CArnoldBarnet was removing and banning people under the excuse of “off topic discussions”/“discussing politics” etc. this is unequivocally bull. Horror is and has always been a political genre. Discussing the political implications of horror is ON TOPIC in this sub and valid discourse. Discussing the influences of current and previous political environments and their relation to horror literature is ON TOPIC. Discussing bias, intolerance, racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. is extremely ON TOPIC for horror literature. So long as the discussion is related to a form of horror literature it is valid. Off Topic is anything that is not horror literature related or even able to interpreted as horror lit adjacent (such as a screenplay) an example would be: I was “windsurfing and saw a scary fish”.

**NEW MOD POSITIONS**
As mentioned before, myself and the other two mods have full time careers that prevent us from keeping as close an eye on the community as we would like. But also, the community has grown at such a rate, more than doubling since when I was first made a mod, that we believe it can no longer be managed by the three of us alone. We are looking to add three new mod team members over the summer to help us in the maintenance of this community we’ve grown to love so deeply.

What you should know: 
-mod is entirely a volunteer position and there is no compensation.
-if you are involved with horror lit professionally such as being an author, publisher, etc you may not use horror lit as a platform for promoting your own works. The same rules apply to you that apply to every other community member especially regarding self-promotion.
-at the moment we are not expecting to work shifts or schedules and are maintaining a casual, check as you go method. This may have to change eventually but we’re hoping between six mods checking in one a day or so is all we need.
-if you are interested in being considered for a mod position please message me u/HorrorIsLiterature directly. I will be bringing the applicants to Grady and Xorobas.

Thank you all for continuing to help make this one of the best places on the internet. This community is unique, strong, and growing exponentially and that’s all because of the community members who share their passion and welcome others.

1630623834.0,Why do so many writers just throw graphic SA and rape scenes in?,"I DNF’d two books this week 50% ish of the way thru because they contained disturbingly graphic sexual assault scenes on young girls that were completely out of place and, quite frankly, disgusting. There was no warning and nothing on the back that even freaking hinted that’s where the story might go.

Why do so many authors do this?? These were both horror/fantasy books. Is there a website that warns for graphic sexual assaults?

Edit: thanks y’all for the websites and suggestions. Have any recs for horror books that contain no sexual assault?

Edit 2: surprised this got so much of a response... I don’t want to name the books because I don’t think they deserve any more publicity. Some people already guessed one in the comments.

Nameless (Grant Morrison) - A little hard to interpret and maybe a case of me being too dumb to get all the nuance here, but a very enjoyable space exploration tale with some very graphic imagery.

The Courtyard/Neonomicon/Providence (Alan Moore) - (disclaimer - haven't read Providence yet). I can barely think of anything else that I've read that has more shock value. Extreme trigger warnings here for sexual assault! Good plot nonetheless but I do wish the violence was dialed down just a little bit.

The Black Monday Murders - Very fun read where wall street makes money using black magic. Short and taut, loved it.

Red Mother (Jeremy Haun) - Pretty cool story about a woman who gets a prosthetic eye following a mugging leading to some harrowing consequences.

Gideon Falls (Jeff Lemire) - Jeff Lemire adds another feather in his cap with a story that spans time and space, and a very unsettling looking antagonist who's present in every one of them.

**Creature Horror**

\-----------------------------

Something is Killing the Children - Won several awards last year, something that only kids can see is killing them left, right and center. Enter our female protagonist/savior who may or may not be all she seems...

Plunge (Joe Hill) - Going to put this here instead of cosmic horror, great story about a distress signal from a ship lost several years ago in the Bering Strait.

The Wake - whenever I hear of Nick Cutter's The Deep, I wish it was more like this one.

Anthology

\------------------------------

Ice Cream Man - Several tales of horror and woe, some good some bad. Somehow most of them tie back to the only common element - the Ice Cream Man.

Bones of the Coast - Several tales of horror based in the Pacific NW. Beautiful and varied artwork seeing as so many collaborators. Pretty cheap too.

In the Dark - Another one with many collaborators, great storytelling for the most part.

Through the Woods (Emily Carroll) - Fantastic art and great storytelling. Does feature some hot takes on classics like Red Riding Hood which I loved.

**Slashers/Gore/Serial Killers**

\----------------------------

Crossed (Garth Ennis) - (Extreme Trigger Warnings for several arcs!) Garth Ennis is known for his proclivity for dark humor and christianity bashing. No surprises here then that he comes up with a virus that makes people act on their basest emotions and the telltale sign is a huge cross that manifests on their face.

From Hell (Alan Moore) - Speculative fiction about Jack the Ripper.

Miss Don't Touch Me (Hubert) - Based in 1930s Paris, has a serial killer on the loose and the story is told through the eyes of a mistress-in-training. Delightful and cutesy art but very unsettling still.

A Basketful of Heads - Fun and short Joe Hill story, think the movie Get Out but with a female protagonist. Several neat twists and awesome use of the supernatural.

My Friend Dahmer - Perhaps the most unsettling of the lot on here seeing as all of this is 100% true. Fascinating read into the mind of an up and coming serial killer.

Bedlam (Nick Spencer) - A terrible serial killer is reformed and says he wants to protect the city he once terrorized. Great book with some very unsettling scenes (TW: Severe Animal Cruelty). Too bad they never finished it.

Abbott (Saladin Ahmed) - An investigative reporter looks into grisly crimes that the police have ignored for some reason, and that seem to have a strong connection to the occult.

**Psychological/Open to Interpretation**

\------------------------------------

Panther (Brecht Evens) - On my list of absolutely fantastic books that I never want to touch again. Wouldn't want to spoil anything at all here but have to add a Trigger Warning. The illustrations are very very creepy in this one.

Regression (Cullen Bunn) - A man tries to deal with his nightmares using hypnotic therapy with some...interesting results.

The Low/Low Woods (Carmen Maria Machado) - I loved Carmen Maria Machado's Her Body and Other Parties and this one did not disappoint either. Very fun and unconventional tale that spans a few categories on here. Great to see non-traditional characters for horror too, loved it.

Infidel (Aaron Campbell) - On NPR's list of the 100 best horror stories, an American Muslim woman lady deals with an entity that feeds off of the xenophobia and racism that she faces from her neighbors.

\--------------------

&#x200B;

A few others I've read but found them to be middling at best - Nailbiter (great premise but terribly anticlimactic), Outer Darkness (art is great but premise is a little far fetched, tries to formalise horror tropes and make them commonplace, think an average version of the film The Cabin in the Woods). Will add more as I recall and thanks for listening!

1668786467.0,"Haunting of Hill House, little over halfway through, would like to share one part.","***Please do not discuss any part of the book that occurs after this part. I am only about halfway through.***

Last night I read the part where Eleanor is awakened by low voices in the room where Theodora was previously staying. Eleanor is grasping tight to Theodora's hand and struggling to sleep amidst the murmuring. She describes them holding hands so tight, that she can feel the bones in her hand. Theo's grasp is tight as well, so they are both lying terrified in the dark. But Eleanor seems to remember falling asleep with the light on, so the darkness is perplexing. Then she hears a child's pleading among the low voices, and ultimately shouts at the voices to stop as she sits up in bed. At that point, Theodora is startled awake and asks what's wrong. Eleanor recoils to the corner of the room and asks: ""Whose hand was I holding?""

This is one of the greatest scenes of any book I have ever read. The way Shirley Jackson built the scene, distracted the reader with a horrific event happening in another room, only to then slap the reader across the face with the true horror of the scene with a single exclamation from Eleanor, is some of the best writing I have ever read. Pure genius. I wish I could repeatedly read that scene with new eyes for the rest of my life. 

Anyway, I just had to share it with somebody.

1690300218.0,I read 12 horror books in the past few months and here's a review of them all!,"Sorted lowest to highest:

**Title:** [Dead Eleven by Jimmy Juliano](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63077620)

**Oversimplified plot:** A journey to understand her son's death leads her to a bizarre town stuck in the past.

**Sub-genre:** mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child death!<

**Opening Lines:** Esther and Gloria had a routine.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** While the plot captured my attention, I found the writing lackluster. The mystery of the town is teased early and often, but the reveal was just so underwhelming. Overall, even though there were some interesting tidbits here and there, I found the book to be boring and forgettable.

---

**Title:** [Songs of a Dead Dreamer and Grimscribe by Thomas Ligotti](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611567)

**Oversimplified plot:** I don't even know how to summarize this. You won't find short stories like this anywhere else.

**Sub-genre:** Short stories

**Bechdel Test:** Pass (on at least 1 short story)

**Trigger Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** In a beautiful home in a beautiful part of town - the town of Nolgate, site of the state prison - Dr. Munck examined the evening newspaper while his young wife lounged on a sofa nearby, lazily flipping through the colorful parade of a fashion magazine.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** Ligotti is an immensely talented author. You can see the Greats that have influenced him but his writing style is completely his own. I strongly believed his works will be studied in the generations to come. Objectively, I understand what he's doing and why he's so good at what he does, but it just doesn't line up with my taste. His peculiar (I mean this in the best way) writing style, focus on creating an atmosphere unlike anything else over characterization, and use of existentialism and absurdity make for an extremely interesting short story. However, reading over 30 of these short stories was exhausting. *I highly recommend this book to all horror fans*, just to get an understanding of what else horror can be. I learned this isn't for me, but I'm glad I read it.

---

**Title:** [Chlorine by Jade Song](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61387386)

**Oversimplified plot:** Ren Yu, the most dedicated swimmer you'll ever know.

**Sub-genre:** coming of age, queer

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child harm, sexual abuse against minors, self harm!<

**Opening Lines:** You are not here of your own free will. You are here because I desired you first. I lured you to me using my intentional charms: my ethereal beauty, my siren song, my six pack, my tail with scales embroidered in flesh.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This isn't a book to read if you want a mystery or crazy twists or subtlety in delivering its themes. If you read the plot summary on the back of the book, you pretty much know how this book goes. However, what this book lacks in unpredictability, it makes up in heart. The protagonist's focus on swimming at the cost of everything else is compelling and through that lens we see the pressures that young women face. Some of it is detestable and forced, some is seemingly self-imposed, but it all makes for an engaging read. I believe that if the last 5 chapters were cut then the story would have been much more impactful, but despite that this is a great novel. This is much more contemporary/literary than horror, but you might be surprised how much you end up liking it.

---

**Title:** [Starve Acre by Andrew Michael Hurley](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45890523)

**Oversimplified plot:** What lengths will a parent go to when grieving their child?

**Sub-genre:** Gothic

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child death, animal cruelty/death!<

**Opening Lines:** Overnight, snow had fallen thickly again in Croftendale and now in the morning the fells on the other side of the valley were pure white against the sky.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Short, sweet and hit a perfect balance of gothic and folk horror. Incredibly enjoyable read, writing just sucked me in immediately, and was paced really well. Great book and can't wait to get into the author's catalog.

---

**Title:** [The Militia House by John Milas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61796642)

**Oversimplified plot:** War is as boring as it is terrible.

**Sub-genre:** mystery, haunted house

**Bechdel Test:** Fail* (male POV)

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Animal harm!<

**Opening Lines:** A dog walks up to the guard post with half its face stuck full of porcupine quills.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This book did a surprisingly good job at covering how boring war can be without being boring itself. The prose was also pretty bare bones and straight forward, but I think it works well for this type of novel. If you like unique takes on the haunted house genre, an MC losing grip on reality, and seemingly inexplicable phenomena, you should give this a shot.

---

**Title:** [Night's Edge by Liz Kerin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61884780)

**Oversimplified plot:** And the worst mom of the year goes to...

**Sub-genre:** vampires!

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!child abuse, domestic violence!<

**Opening Lines:** I'm hungry and it's two in the morning. The fridge is empty. And Mom is dead on the couch.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Vampires were the worm that caused me to bite, but the actual hook was the relationship between the mother and daughter. The author did an incredible job dissecting the relationship between an emotionally immature and abusive parent and a daughter that had to grow up too fast. This book evoked a lot of emotions from me and it was a tough read. Also, the pacing of this novel is just incredible; the tension was kept up from the first chapter to the last. Also, also, this book has probably one of my favorite openings.

---

**Title:** [Maeve Fly by C.J. Leede](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61884781)

**Oversimplified plot:** Disney princess by day, disturbed premeditator by night.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!sexual assault, torture!<

**Opening Lines:** Every man shares the same fantasy, and it is t his:

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** After reading that this book was inspired by American Psycho, I was worried that it would be a rehashing of the same themes of materialism wrapped in unadulterated violence. I was pleasantly surprised to see that there are many fresh ideas here, while still containing an abundance of absolutely sickening violence and gore and sex. Will you be able to relate to any of the characters? No. But why would you even want to? Will you be rooting for anyone? Not really. Will you have fun? Absolutely. Sit back, take in the madness, bring a bucket if you're squeamish, and just enjoy the ride.

**Title:** [The Marigold by Andrew F. Sullivan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61773985)

**Oversimplified plot:** First line from the summary is all you need: In a near-future Toronto buffeted by environmental chaos and unfettered development, an unsettling new lifeform begins to grow beneath the surface, feeding off the past

**Sub-genre:** sci-fi kinda??

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** Before everything that happened, before the towers, before the site plans, before the deeds, before the failing sports bar and two-bedroom apartment above it that often operated like another, more financially successful, unlicensed sports bar until the police shut it down after that one Polish kid got strangled with a pair of pink stockings behind the abandoned Shoppers Drug Mart a block or two south, there were trees here.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This book was incredibly written, had a slow, building pace, and had several disparate storylines that came together in a very satisfying way. I love how seamless the transition is from the grounded reality of the struggles of an everyday person just trying to survive to this bizarre paranormal, dystopian world of sentient mold and world-ending conspiracies. A really, really wonderful book that I can see myself liking more and more as time goes by.

---

**Title:** [The Salt Grows Heavy by Cassandra Khaw](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61884779)

**Oversimplified plot:** A mermaid and a plague doctor try to survive in a cruel world.

**Sub-genre:** Fantasy

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!violence towards children!<

**Opening Lines:** ""Where are you going?""

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** This was absolutely hypnotic. I was mesmerized from page 1 until the very end. The prose is dense, lyrical, and filled to the brim with GRE words, but it all lends to this utterly bizarre world we're thrown in. Also, good god this novella has more body horror than some splatterpunk I've read.  
Also, I know, I know, I get it - everyone here hates Nothing but Blackened Teeth. Personally, I really liked that novel. I think this one is even better. If you liked Nothing but Blackened Teeth, you'll probably really like this book. If you didn't, you *miiiight* be swayed by this book, but no guarantees!

**Title:** [Ascension by Nicholas Binge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61813107)

**Oversimplified plot:** When a mountain suddenly appears in the middle of the ocean, a team of experts are assembled for an expedition.

**Sub-genre:** sci-fi thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Fail* (male POV)

**Trigger Warnings:** >!suicide, child death!<

**Opening Lines:** My brother disappeared twenty-nine years ago. It didn't happen on a specific day, or even during a specific month. THe process was a slow drifting - a realization that grew in me like a poison, a splinter at the stem of my brain.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** This book felt like it was written specifically for me. It had literally everything I want. A bunch of experts in their field mysteriously brought together? Check. Weird biological, physical, and geological phenomena? Check. Survival on a mountain whilst being plagued by psychological and physical torment? Check. I could go on for a while. A couple of minor (for me) gripes - this did not need to be told in an epistolary style, it could have been just straight first person, and the motivation of assembling the team is a trope that I dislike. Luckily, neither of these things really impact the story. I loved this book and the ending was just *chef's kiss* super satisfying.

**Title:** [Sister, Maiden, Monster by Lucy A. Snyder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60784461)

**Oversimplified plot:** This is no normal pandemic.

**Sub-genre:** Body horror, fantasy

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!extreme body horror, sexual assault, child death!<

**Opening Lines:** It was only Tuesday evening, and I was already bone-tired. Wrung out.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Weirdest bait and switch experience I've had where I loved both the bait and the switch. I didn't read the synopsis going in so I had no idea or expectations of this story. It started off as a grounded horror in the midst of a pandemic getting serious, and then half way through SIKE. This is actually a brutal, gore-y, sex-filled cosmic body horror. This book made me feel uncomfortable in my own skin and weirdly aroused and then horrified at myself for feeling that way. I love this book. It isn't without its problem, but the good is so good that the bad barely mattered to me.

**Title:** [The Strange by Nathan Ballingrud](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61272810)

**Oversimplified plot:** A girl pursues a thief through the wastelands of Mars.

**Sub-genre:** Sci-fi/western

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** I was thirteen when the Silence came to Mars, settling over us like a smothering dust. We don't talk about those days much anymore, and most who lived through them are dead.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** I am absolutely blown away by this novel. On the surface this looks like an interesting western sci-fi horror set in Mars. But at its core this is a story about a foresaken and desperate people and a young girl who was forced to grow up too quick looking for revenge. From the very first chapter, I was completely immersed in this world; it's so real. The way Ballingrud portrays our 14 year-old protagonist is one of the best depictions of a child facing the trauma of having to mature fast I've ever seen. Everything in this book is virtually perfect, from the pacing to the characterization to the plot. I could write pages and pages of praise for this novel.

**Review:** This had all the ingredients to make for a 5 star read but the execution was fumbled. The book is divided into 5 parts and it's like each part wanted to be a completely different book. The plot transitions from one part to the next are flimsy at best and nonexistent at worst, and the ending just felt like I was watching a movie at 5x speed.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** If I just had to pick one word to describe this book, that word would be ""fun."" It gets going pretty fast, and once it does, it doesn't stop until the very end. There are bits that I found to be eye-rolling, some of the twists and turns were pretty obvious, and a couple minor plot holes, but overall I just had way more fun than I was expecting. I looked down and realized I was almost 3 quarters of the way through the book and I didn't even realize it!

**Sub-genre:** Queer horror

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** Content warning from the author: >!Brainwyrms features (very) taboo sex that many would consider unsafe or unsanitary, as well as sexual violence and child abuse.!<

**Opening Lines:** The sea, if it was the sea, was the consistency of spit.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** I can feel the anger and resentment and hatred of the world radiating from this book with every word. Subtlety? Who's she? Hope? Haven't heard of her. And on top of all that, this book is absolutely fucking filthy. You'll need a breather after this one. Keep 'em coming, Rumfitt, this shit is incredible.

**Title:** [Monstrilio by Gerardo Sámano Córdova](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62888191)

**Oversimplified plot:** A grieving mother removes a piece of lung from her dead child and creates something new.

**Sub-genre:** Fantasy

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!child death!<

**Opening Lines:** Her son dies in a child-sized bed, big enough for him but barely enough to hold her and her husband who cling to the edges, folding themselves small so they fit one on each side of him. She savors the constant shifting and squirming needed to keep her in place.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Heartbreaking and melancholic and at times downright terrifying. This novel has surprising breadth and span despite being a punchy 300ish pages. And to its credit, not a single word is wasted. It's beautifully written and the characters are unbelievably real. To the point of frustration, because of how mad they'll make you feel while knowing that you or someone you know might act exactly the same in this bizarre situation. I would classify this as an incredible book that I'll never, ever read again. I don't have many books on that shelf.

**Title:** [The Dead Take the A Train by Cassandra Khaw](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65214080)

**Opening Lines:** There were few things in life Julie Crews enjoyed more than bachelorette parties. They were, by design, one of those rare events where women weren't just permitted but encouraged to throw off their inhibitions.

**Opening Lines:** Last night I had that dream where I was washing my face and after I ran the cloth over my shut lids, I opened them again and one of my eyes fell out. My left eye. Right eye? No, it was definitely the left, the sinister one, with all that that implies.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Just so damn good. Deliciously dark, creepy, and weird. This collection of short stories just hit the spot for me on so many levels. They're a combination of good literary work, excellent and creative scares, and overall entertaining. That's a hard combo to pull off.

**Review:** I had an absolute blast reading this from beginning to end. There was a slow but steady building of dread, that ""something's not quite right here"" feeling. Topics of motherhood and dealing with a new disability and domestic strife are handled so excellently and using them as vehicles to enhance the horror was masterful. After Mary and now this, the next time I see Nat Cassidy's name on a book, I will buy it with no context needed.

**Title:** [Red Rabbit by Alex Grecian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65212070)

**Oversimplified plot:** Strange bedfellows on a bizarre adventure.

**Sub-genre:** Fantasy/folk

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!animal death, child death, sexual assault!<

**Opening Lines:** They buried the girl next to her mother on the first warm day of spring.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** This book just hit the spot! Rural fantasy is already such a rare but sought out genre and then adding horror into the mix?! There were just so many good things in this book: a bit of whimsy, a lot of heart, a ton of guts, a truly bizarre plot. On top of that following tropes from so many genres: adventure, thriller, horror, fantasy. This is an incredible amalgamation that shouldn't work but it does! It's like when you were a kid and mixing random stuff together and then discovered that dipping fries in  your milkshake is freaking delicious.

**Title:** [The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26892110)

**Oversimplified plot:** She's not like other girls. (There's really no point in summarizing this book, nothing will do it justice.)

**Sub-genre:** Fantasy

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!so many dogs dying. so many. also rape, child death, and child abuse.!<

**Opening Lines:** Caroly, blood-drenched and barefoot, walked alone down the two-lane stretch of blacktop that the Americans called Highway 78.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** There's a fascinating documentary called Icarus that is about biking. Initially, racing was the purpose of the documentary. The protagonist wanted to see how far he could push his limits. However, as the movie continues, it morphs into something else entirely: doping. And as the focus on doping continues the stakes go through the roof until it turns into this enormous, international event with wild implications. Reading this book felt like watching that documentary. It starts out with a simple enough, fantasy-like premise, and then morphs into something else entirely. And as that continues, the stakes also go through the roof. I have never watched a documentary like Icarus and I've never read a book like this.

1675351195.0,I’ve watched over an hour of interviews promoting Knock at the Cabin. Not one mention of the book.,"I’ve probably watched 10 different interviews by now. It all started with Bautista cuz I love Bautista. Didn’t expect him to know anything about the book really. Not his job. Or any of the actors.

But what shocked me was not
Even a single interviewer brought up the book. They asked M Night questions like it’s a completely original screenplay. It’s really bizarre. I figured somebody would mention the source material at least once but nope.",horrorlit
1627908397.0,For fans of Junji Ito looking for similar stuff check PTSD Radio,"Junji Ito is a fantastic writer, he is arguably the greatest ""lovecraftian"" author this generation. Which is an incredible feat considering he is a manga/comic writer foremost.

That being said, there is another sort-of famous mangaka artist named Masaaki Nakayama. Like Ito, he is also interested in extreme body gore, lovecraftian concepts, episodic chapters and human faces contorting into very specific shapes/emotions.

His most famous work is [Seeds of Anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuan_no_Tane), which is a very good collection/collage of really short stories (like 1-2 pages per story) with japanese horror urban tales about ghosts, demons, etc. It's a very good collection, if you like Ito's more episodic work you better check Seeds... It's good stuff.

That being said, I do think Nakayama's true masterpiece is [PTSD Radio](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24033582-1-kouishou-radio-1). It starts as a few disconnected stories, but slowly you start to realize they are all taking place in the same universe, with the only constant being a primordial hair god tormenting a village after some of the residents destroyed an idol statue.

Although similar to Ito's work in a sense, I do think Nakayama crafted a very unique horror work here. It's as much Ito and Lovecraft as it is Lynch even, which is not a common trope you'll find in manga/comic.

Some people might dismiss the work as very episodic and superficial at first, but I'd say those have really either missed the point or have just read the first entries in the comic.",horrorlit

1589824392.0,Horror Section in Progress at Barnes & Noble,"Hi everyone,
Just thought you would all like an update on how the horror section is developing at Barnes & Noble. Well, we’ve finally begun pulling books together and putting them in their own section. My store has a bit over two bays so far, one naturally is King but the other stuff may surprise you. There are certainly a lot of solo titles and authors I’ve never heard of before so I’m going to be browsing the section a little closely. This is all subject to change and likely will grow over the next few months. You’ve got to remember we haven’t received regular shipments since February. I’ll keep you all updated! [Horror Section in Progress Pics](https://imgur.com/gallery/7f3xHKb)",horrorlit
1646146611.0,I read 23 horror books in February and here's a mini review of them all!,"This was an amazing month for me! So many fantastic and unforgettable books! They're sorted from lowest to highest rated.

[The Hollow Ones by Guillermo del Toro](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52594581-the-hollow-ones) 3/5 - I wanted to like it more and it started off pretty interesting but it kinda turned into a regular mystery thriller. I wanted more horror and was expecting way more because of del Toro.  
[Predators by Michaelbrent Collings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52749674-predators) 3/5 - Fun horror thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat about a group of people being hunted after a wilderness tour in Africa goes wrong. I think this was meant to also be a character study of this group of tourist but the bad guys were cartoonishly bad, the good guys were cartoonishly good, and any character development that occured felt kinda whatever.  
[The Monster of Elendhaven by Jennifer Giebrecht](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43263515) 3/5 - Short and sweet novella about 2 monsters fucking shit up and finding something in each other.  
[Your House Is on Fire, Your Children Are Gone by Stefan Kiesbye](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13542949-your-house-is-on-fire-your-children-all-gone) 3/5 - Everyone is so nasty and the things they do to each other and themselves are terrible. It's a bit jarring at times because people do these terrible things out of no where, but I think that's done on purpose. I liked it!  
[Dead Silence by S.A. Barnes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693184-dead-silence) 3/5 - I think the hype got to me because I was expecting way more than I got. Overall, this is a good space horror that will definitely scratch that itch. I personally didn't like the first person narration and thought this could have been a much tighter and edited down story.  
[Ghost Radio by Leopoldo Gout](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3707819-ghost-radio) 4/5 - I had a hard time rating this one because the concept was fantastic (a host of a paranormal radio loses his grip on reality) but the flow was so odd - almost meandering at times. I decided going higher because I've been thinking about this story long after I finished reading it and I think that's a mark of a good book.  
[Exoskeleton by Shane Stadler](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16086863-exoskeleton) 4/5 - I'm having such a hard time rating this book. I've been jumping between 2 stars and 5 stars which is just crazy. I finally landed on 4 stars because the journey was incredible despite the ending being bizarre and not in a good way. This is very much a plot driven book - don't expect amazing character development or anything like that. A man is convicted of the rape and attempted murder of a 16 year old girl and chooses to take a compressed punishment of 1 year inside an exoskeleton instead of 25 years in a prison. Wrong choice bucko. Extreme body horror!  
[Devil House by John Darnielle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693663-devil-house) 4/5 - This is honestly more of a mystery thriller and less of a haunted house horror story. Not to say it's bad - it's not and I genuinely enjoyed it - but I think you could be easily disappointed reading this if you are expecting something.  
[Thunderhead by Douglas Preston](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136636.Thunderhead) 4/5 - So much fun! It was like I was watching a movie. It's archaelogical discovery + horror which is always an entertaining combo.  
[We Sang in the Dark by Joe Hart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55781757-we-sang-in-the-dark) 4/5 - I really enjoyed this cult horror and felt genuinely uneasy multiple times throughout.  
[Such a Pretty Smile by Kristi DeMeester](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693146-such-a-pretty-smile) 4/5 - An exploration of mother-daughter relationship, an amplification of horrific things women face, and a good balance between atmospheric horror and mystery thriller.   
[Echo by Thomas Olde Heuvelt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53329253-echo) 4/5 - I was really looking forward to this after enjoying Hex by the same author. I think it has a really strong start and the premise is unbelievably cool. The prose did get a little repetitive at times and I think it could have been significantly shorter. Despite that, I really enjoyed this one!  
[You Should Have Left by Daniel Kehlmann](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32855689-you-should-have-left) 4/5 - Wonderfully bizarre and genuinely unsettling novella that has an interesting twist on a haunted house. Finished it in one sitting.  
[Dear Laura by Gemma Amor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52102795-dear-laura) 4/5 - Laura gets a letter from a stranger on her birthday every year offering clues of her missing friend in exchange for increasingly personal things. The author made me feel unsettled and so tense in this short novella.  
[The Last Plague by Rich Hawkins](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22958571-the-last-plague) 4/5 - Post-apocalpytic horror filled with action, monsters, and amazing imagery. Had fun from beginning to end and can't wait to pick up the next two books.  
[The Button Box trilogy by Stephen King & Richard Chizmar](https://www.goodreads.com/series/271678-the-button-box) 4/5 - 2 short novellas amd a novel that I read back to back to back. Great character work, very interesting premise, and had so many touching moments throughout.   
[Human Acts by Han Kang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30091914-human-acts) **5/5** - The Gwangju Uprising began after students in the South Korean Chonnam University protested against martial law government and were brutalized, murdered, and raped by Japanese troops. This book looks through the eyes of 6 people and tells their story. It's an absolutely brutal and unapologetic story that is told incredibly skillfully and with wonderful prose.   
[My Annihilation by Fuminori Nakamura](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59241078-my-annihilation) **5/5** - One of those stories that keeps you guessing and totally engrossed up until the last page. If you're a fan of twisted, Japanese revenge stories, this is a great book for you.  
[The Laws of the Skies by Grégoire Courtois](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42372424-the-laws-of-the-skies) **5/5** - GOD DAMN. That was fucking brutal. Biggest pet peeve was that kids don't talk like kids, but if you can get past that, this is a great, short, and violent read.  
[String Follow by Simon Jacobs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693658-string-follow) **5/5** - This was a weird one! Lots of POVs including one in second person narration of a strange entity. I read and reread sections multiple times going back and forth. I loved this book for all its weirdness. It's ambitious and it pays off.  
[Pet Sematary by Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33124137-pet-sematary) **5/5** - WOW. I can't believe I've been reading Stephen King for almost 2 decades and this is the first time I read Pet Sematary. I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said about this book. Do yourself a favor and read it.

1617050393.0,"Between Two Fires, by Christopher Buehlman, is the best thing I've read in a long time","This is ***literature***. I don’t pretend to know how the term is properly defined, but I’m sure this book qualifies. And that’s interesting, since the author makes such liberal use of the words *cunting* and *whoring* (both as adjectives!).

*They’ll kill the good ones first, and when all the good men are dead, they’ll come for men like you, who were almost sound, but not quite; the bowls that leaked. And when you’re gone, the worst of men will find themselves in the teeth of their masters, because those that fell have no love for man. And they’ll take good and bad alike to Hell, because there won’t be anyplace but Hell anymore. Not without love. Not without forgiveness.*

It's an epic story, told on a human scale. The problem with most epic tales is that the stories are often too big for the pages. This is the story of literal heaven and literal hell (angels vs devils) at war for humanity. At stake is no less than the eternal damnation of every person who has ever lived and ever will live. But that story, the grand one, happens off-camera. Every several chapters we get one or two pages to remind us of the stakes and keep us informed of the progress. We understand that this epic battle is taking place, but that’s not what the book is about. The vast majority of the book is a much more digestible story.

*A glimpse through an open door revealed a hell of vomiting, coughing, and sobbing with a very few wretched figures in white trying to ease the torments of far, far too many.*

The action takes place in 14th-century France, at the height of the Black Plague. Death is all around and ever-present. An unlikely group is embarked on a quest to do . . . something. No one is entirely sure what awaits them at their destination, or what they’re actually trying to accomplish, but they’ve nothing better going on.

*We’ve been eating twigs and earwax for a week.*

Our group consists of a disgraced priest with a predilection for little boys, an excommunicated knight with a predilection for killing things and using gerunds as adjectives, and a little girl who might be an angel or saint or some kind of witch who’s putting us all on. We don’t know, and in the broader context, it almost doesn’t matter.

*“Don’t take on so,” said Thomas. “Nothing cunting matters.”*

*“That’s the way a man talks before he damns himself.”*

*“It’s not the first time I’ve said it.”*

We have a classic road-trip. A rag-tag group is traipsing across France, possibly to save all of humankind, possibly not.  This is, though, definitely a horror story. We encounter several monsters along the way. I guess they’re hellspawn or demons or something like that, and most of them are really pretty frightening. They’re imaginative in their horribleness. My favorite might be the thing made up of a broomstick and the arms of several dead nuns. What a bitch!

*It’s not that nobody has seen those that knock; it’s that what they’ve seen is so awful.*

And yet, as perhaps we’ve come to expect, the most monstrous characters are the human ones. There is an almost throwaway backstory, barely an aside, that ends with a little boy standing there, repeating “But, we live here. We live here.” That one really got to me and still haunts my thoughts.

*He seemed less a cleric than the antidote to clericism. If Christ had been German as well as a carpenter, and if He had survived His scourging, and if He had shorn His head with a broken bottle, He might well have looked like this man.*

As with all great stories, the primary focus of this one is on relationships. The relationships between the main characters. The relationships between the main characters and those they meet along their journey. The backstories, and relationships described therein, are maddening, disconcerting and heartbreaking.

*He sensed that he would have died had he remained. Not of his injuries. Something had been coming for him, and he had just escaped. Had he remained, he would not only have died, he would have died spectacularly.*

We reach the destination with almost a quarter of the book remaining, so things are not quickly wrapped up. There is an economy of words in this book (you could hardly tell an epic story, one that is satisfying at least, in 432 pages otherwise), but it reads neither rushed nor sluggish. It is poetic but muscular, beautiful but terrifying.

*Hoc est corpus meum.*

After finishing *Fires*, there is definitely a hole in my heart; I feel *bereft*. Apparently, it’s time for me to binge this new-to-me author.",horrorlit

1663795540.0,Between Two Fires delivers an amazing medieval horror experience,"“Between Two Fires” by Christopher Buehlman is a wonderful medieval horror that checks all the boxes for everything you’re looking for in such a novel. Even though there are many religious tones and references throughout this, it’s all meaningful and truly paints a diabolical picture of this era.

Besides the characters that were truly memorable, I’ve never read such horrific situations in a novel in quite some time. I won’t ruin anything for you but my goodness, Christopher Buehlman really took things to some very bizarre and creepy levels. I literally had to re-read several scenes a few times because they were that scary and freaked me out!

The atmosphere, setting, dialogue, and even descriptions during that era were all brilliantly written. Even the numerous fight scenes added a nice balance to this dark story and when you put it all together, you have an amazing read. Even the cover rocks as this was a great reading experience from beginning to end as it was a genuine page-turner and then some!

I give “Between Two Fires” by Christopher Buehlman a perfect 5/5 because this is easily a novel I will remember for many years to come. I look forward to reading some of his previous work and anything else he publishes in the future as I will gladly purchase because I was blown away by this one. I highly recommend this novel to anyone that loves horror with a dark, medieval, and religious twist that’s not overdone at all.

I can definitely vouch for Weird Horror-- It's slickly-produced and has both really good stories and excellent nonfiction, including my favorite book review section of any magazine. It's definitely my favorite horror lit journal after Black Static, and I hope that everyone will consider giving it a try! Physical horror publications of this caliber are few and far between these days.

""Hello All,

I do hope that you are all well and safe and that 2021 is treating you kindly.  


I apologize for the mass e-mail. It was simpler than sending out 536 separate e-mails.

536 is the exact amount of print copies of Weird Horror #1 I sold directly from our website to you lovely readers. Thank you! Of course, we did sell some eBooks and other copies through various vendors.

I'm here to ask for your help in trying to get close to selling 500 copies again directly through us. Specifically, we'd love to get 500 print subscribers. (We're working with Weightless Books to offer a digital subscription soon.)

If you've already subscribed - thank you! I am truly grateful.

If you don't currently have the means to subscribe, I completely understand. I thank you for purchasing the first issue. Your purchase helped us to budget for issues #2 & #3.

As it stands, we currently have about 180 print subscribers. It's hard to say what the break even point would be for us, but it's roughly 300 print subscribers. We pay all our contributors -- writers, artists, designers, typesetter, etc. -- and printing and postage (from Canada) are costly. As you can imagine, margins are very tight.  


We want Weird Horror to be an ongoing source of great horror fiction and non-fiction. It's no exaggeration to say that the next 2 issues go from strength to strength. With Black Static magazine winding down, and Cemetery Dance and Weird Tales seemingly on hiatus, there really is no reliable print horror magazine. The first issue has been lauded by Ellen Datlow, Adam Nevill, Paula Guran and more.

Assuming we meet our subscriber threshold, we'll open to fiction submissions for issue #4 on September 1.

Issue 2 will be out late March. It's in production now. Issue 3 will be out in October.

So, if you enjoyed the first issue and have the means to subscribe, we certainly could use your help.

You'll get 2 jam-packed issues mailed to you anywhere in the world for just $28 (U.S.) You can subscribe right here:

[https://undertowpublications.com/shop/whsubs](https://undertowpublications.com/shop/whsubs)

I do hope you'll consider a subscription to our crazy little upstart magazine. I can guarantee that you will absolutely love the next 2 issues. And your subscription will directly help us plan and budget for issues #4 and #5.  


I'm very grateful and appreciative of your continued support.

Stay well and treat each other kindly.

\*Fear factor: 5/10

\*Horror elements: Vampirism; body horror

This is a must-read for fans of a well-crafted vampire story. Set in the 1970s, the novel follows two “rovers,” or vagabond vampires, as they travel the deserts of the American West and cross paths with a vampire biker gang. The novel’s two protagonists draw inevitable comparison to Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men, which may be one of the reasons I love this story so much.  The chapters alternate POV among the two brothers, the biker gang members, and a grieving father. Each chapter’s change in perspective keeps the writing fresh.  The first half of the novel is a bit of a slow burn, but the second half escalates quickly and brutally.  The quality of writing is exceptional; Lange really deserves some awards for this.

\*Horror elements: Demonic possession

Written in 2003, this novel still holds up well as a modern story of demonic possession. The first-person narration puts us in the shoes of Amanda, a middle-aged career professional, as a creepy demonic presence takes over her mind and body. Her descent into madness is artfully and gradually depicted over the course of this remarkably short-novel. It’s a single day read, and worth it!

**NOS4A2 (Nosferatu) - by Joe Hill**

\*Prose: 10/10

\*Narrative: 9/10

\*Pace: 8/10

\*Fear Factor: 8/10

\*Horror elements: vampirism, magical realism, body horror, sexual sadism (brief)

Who doesn’t LOVE the concept of creepy, Christmas-time horror? This is one my favorite books of the year. A detective follows the trail of missing children into the psychotic wonderland of an old-timey vampire, whose idea of holiday cheer is terrifying.  The villain Charles Manx and his henchman, the perverted and childlike “Gas Man,” are among the most memorable I’ve come across. I found the pace of the story riveting (although others on this reddit have complained of some lagging chapters in the middle.)  Joe Hill’s prose is exceptionally vivid, and the tension-building is master-class.  The finale is memorably grisly. Be warned, this is a LONG book.

\*Horror elements: Ghost haunting; body horror

Another winner by Joe Hill. This is a tale of the malevolent haunting of a washed-out rock artist, who's admittedly a scumbag. The novel features some true pulse-pounding imagery.  The pace flagged a bit in the middle for me, but over-all the tension-building was excellent.  Some of the depictions of ghostly visitations were truly chilling.

\*Narrative: 10/10

\*Pace: 10/10

\*Fear Factor: 9/10

\*Horror elements: body horror, cosmic horror, depictions of Hell, monsters, cannibalism

This collection of short stories blew me away.  This was my favorite short-story collection of the year, and  a MUST READ for any fans of horror! The creativity of these stories are akin to Clive Barker, who was a major influence on Ballingrud’s writing. The seminal piece, “The Butcher’s Table,” is hailed by many to be one of the most entertaining pieces of horror writing in modern times. If you’re piqued by the idea of Caribbean pirates and a cannibal cult sailing into the gates of Hell, look no further than this book.

\*Prose: 8/10

\*Narrative: 9/10

\*Fear Factor: 8/10

\*Horror elements: depictions of “hell,” torture, body horror, monsters

A classic novella that is also a must-read for horror fans. This was the book which originated the “Hell Raiser” series, and here we are first introduced to the sadist Cenobites, the ghoulish demons who promise exquisite “pleasures of the flesh” in exchange for one’s soul. I’m rarely frightened reading anything, but the opening chapter of this novel is seared in my brain.

\*Prose: 8/10

\*Narrative: 8/10

\*Pace: 5/10

\*Fear Factor: 7/10

\*Horror elements: cosmic horror, body horror (mild), monsters

Few books are more divisive in this community than this one. Langan’s writing has been described as “horror meets classic literature.” Some readers may find Langan’s prose and pacing too tedious for entertaining horror.  The author’s sentences are wordy and dense, with huge descriptive paragraphs filling page after page (think H.P. Lovecraft). I personally enjoyed the slow burn, because the depth of the writing is so beautiful. I found the story rewarding and chilling in its completion, and I spent a long time pondering this one afterwards.

\*Prose: 8/10

\*Narrative: 6/10

\*Pace: 6/10

\*Fear Factor: 5/10

\*Horror elements: hauntings; body horror; monsters; zombies

A short-story collection by Langan.  Honestly, half the stories were duds for me, and Langan’s writing here was more tedious for me than in “The Fisherman.” However, there were a few highlights. “Mother of Stone” is an entertaining, detective-type story of a haunted mansion.  “Technicolor” is a genius reworking of Poe’s “The Masque of the Red Death,” delivered as a professor’s sermon to his class.  The rest of the pieces were about… well, I forget.

**Tell Me I’m Worthless - by Alison Rumfit**

\*Prose: 5/10

\*Narrative: 5/10

\*Pace: 6/10

\*Fear Factor: 5/10

\*Horror elements: Strong sexual violence & depictions of rape; haunted house; gender dysphoria; mental health crises

This book was trying to be a lot of things, and generally just left me feeling confused. It reads like a political manifesto masquerading as a haunted house story.  The narrative story takes a backseat to the author's hammering of social-political issues. I understand that this book may read differently to a British audience, with its heavy-handed diatribes about British imperialism, anti-immigrant sentiment, and fascism, but the story felt like a jumbled mess to me. An unreliable narrator, with confusing internal dialogues, and multi-page rants from 4Chan fascists, left me skimming through entire chapters. I will give kudos to the author for attempting to educate readers about violence and discordance within the queer community, but I wish this book hadn’t taken on all these subjects at once.

**The Troop - by Nick Cutter**

\*Prose: 5/10

\*Narrative: 7/10

\*Pace: 9/10

\*Fear Factor: 8/10

\*Horror elements: Strong body horror, cannibalism, parasite infections, animal torture

Another controversial book on this subreddit. For this book, think “Lord of the Flies” meets “The Thing.” The story follows a gang of Boy Scouts on a camping expedition to a remote island, where their hunger… uh… gets the best of them. Yes, it’s creepy and gross, and yes, there is animal cruelty. But if you can stomach the imagery, the book is a real-page turner. Nick Cutter reads like an adult R.L. Stine.

**The Deep - by Nick Cutter**

\*Prose: 5/10

\*Narrative: 6/10

\*Pace: 7/10

\*Fear Factor: 5/10

\*Horror elements: Deep sea monsters; claustrophobia; body horror (fat phobia)

The concept of the book is marvelous: humanity is scourged by a plague, and the only cure lies in a deep-sea research station, which has lost contact with the surface.  But the delivery of the premise is sorely lacking. There were too many glaring holes in the plot, and the second half simply whimpered out, when I wanted escalation and a big reveal. I also found the frequent flashbacks about his missing child to be tedious and distracting to the flow of the novel. The creepiest parts of the book, in my opinion, involved the narrator’s relationship with his mother, who… jiggles a lot.

**A Short Stay in Hell - by Stephen Peck**

\*Prose: 8/10

\*Narrative: 10/10

\*Pace: 6/10

\*Fear Factor: 10/10

\*Horror elements: Depictions of infinity; body horror; depictions of hell, existential horror

For such a short novel, this book packs a powerful punch. A man dies and wakes up in hell—in a vast, endless library—tasked with finding one single book which perfectly depicts his life. It’s a story about the horror of living forever, about forgetting everything that mattered, and ultimately, about losing hope. There are no big scares in here, just a deeply unsettling idea.  Like many others who’ve read this book, I still think about this novel months after finishing it.  If you like horror with a philosophical or existential bent, this is the one for you.

**The Croning - By Laird Barron**

**The Beautiful Thing That Awaits Us All  - By Laird Barron**

\*Prose: 10/10

\*Narrative: 8/10

\*Pace: 7/10

\*Fear Factor: 9/10

\*Horror elements: cosmic horror, body horror, cannibalism, cults, monster horror

I grouped these together, because Barron’s style of writing is so similar, and his mythos extends across all his writing.  If you like the way Barron writes—and I absolutely do—then you’ll enjoy all of these stories.  Barron’s re-invention of the “Old Ones” brings Lovecraft to modern day, in the form of Old Leech and other blood-thirsty gods.  Barron’s prose is probably the best among any writer I’ve seen the past 10 years. I found his actual novel “The Croning” a bit of a confusing jigsaw puzzle—where each chapter seemed to want to be its own short story. His short story “Hand of Glory” was my favorite piece—a gritty, fast-paced detective noire, with the perfect narrative voice. If you’ve never read Barron, start with his collection, “The Beautiful Thing That Awaits Us All.”

(\*Edit - I mistakenly listed ""Men from Porlock"" instead of the proper story, ""Hand of Glory,"" for my horror noire favorite.)

**The Ballad of Black Tom - by Victor LaValle**

\*Prose: 7/10

\*Narrative: 6/10

\*Pace: 4/10

\*Fear Factor: 2/10

\*Horror elements: Cosmic horror, racial tension

Set in the 1920s, this short novel retells Lovecraft’s Cthulhu mythos from the perspective of a black music artist from Harlem. It’s a quick read, and it deserves credit for tackling Lovecraft’s racial prejudices head-on. But as a horror novel, it was quite lacking in punch. (Edit\* I'm told the story is inspired by Lovecraft's The Horror at Red Hook.)

**Swan Song - by Robert McCammon**

\*Prose: 7/10

\*Narrative: 6/10

\*Pace: 5/10

\*Fear Factor: 5/10

\*Horror elements: body horror, post-apocalyptic landscapes, monsters

Often compared to King’s “The Stand,” this novel is another take on a post-apocalyptic America, where a band of survivors gather to battle an unspeakable evil.  And when I say “unspeakable,” I mean it. The author has a difficult time depicting exactly what they’re up against, despite the incredible length of this 500+ page novel.  I understand why people enjoy this story; it’s literally “The Stand” told again. But I found the writing bland and tiresome, and the dialogue of the “good” characters is utterly exhausting. The villains begin as interesting characters, but they lose their menace as the novel trails on…and on…and on…

**Between Two Fires - by Christopher Buehlman**

\*Narrative: 9/10

\*Pace: 8/10

\*Fear Factor: 8/10

\*Horror elements: depictions of hell, torture, post-apocalyptic landscapes, monsters

Set in the Dark Ages of Europe, after a plague has unleashed hellspawn upon the earth, the novel follows a disgraced knight fighting for his life and for redemption for his wicked deeds. I loved every page of this book. The historical setting is fascinating; the depictions of hell are truly chilling (especially the chapter near the end); and the monster battles are strongly reminiscent of The Witcher.  I love that the author injects fresh elements of horror throughout the entire novel, and I also enjoyed the story-arcs of the characters.

**Behold the Void - by Philip Fracassi**

\*Prose: 8/10

\*Narrative: 9/10

\*Pace: 7/10

\*Fear Factor: 7/10

\*Horror elements: Monster horror; body horror; cosmic horror

A short-story collection whose strength lies in its carefully-crafted plots.  Fracassi’s writing style is a bit long-winded (like John Langan), and occasionally heavy-handed with the adjectives, but the stories are short enough to finish each in one read.  His plots tend to build slowly and escalate madly at the end of each piece.  My highlights were “Altar,” “The Horse Thief,” and “Baby Farmer.”

&#x200B;

**Weaveworld - by Clive Barker**

\*Prose: 8/10

\*Narrative: 8/10

\*Pace: 6/10

\*Fear Factor 5/10

\*Horror elements: Monster horror; depictions of hell; sexual violence

I’d consider this “horror-adjacent,” as it’s really more a fantasy world-builder with dark elements to it. I felt this novel was far too long. The pace really dipped in the middle, and I lost patience with all the competing factions in the story.  Barker’s prose is strong, but he could use a sharp editor to cut down on length. Entire chapters could have been axed from this book without noticing.  The most frightening component of the story, the “Three Sisters,” featured heavily in the beginning, but sadly become afterthoughts in the latter tale. If you’re expecting a horror novel similar to Barker’s other work, this is not it.

\*Horror elements:  monsters, haunting, body horror (mild), basketball

As a horror novel, I didn’t understand this story at all.  I do appreciate the perspective of life on a reservation, and the social tensions which face modern Native Americans. And I was morbidly fascinated by the author’s insistence that basketball was a sharp allegory for everything in this novel.

**Road of Bones – By Christopher Golden**

\*Prose: 5/10

\*Narrative: 5/10

\*Pace: 5/10

\*Fear Factor: 3/10

\*Horror elements: Malevolent spirits, ghost hauntings, animal cruelty (mild)

Another novel which squanders a perfect horror setting in favor of a mundane story. This book follows a duo of documentary filmmakers who set out in the Siberian wilderness to discover the secrets of the “road of bones,” a highway raised upon the literal bones of Soviet laborers who died building it. The novel's focus meanders frequently off the road of bones onto a variety of other ""forest spirits"" and dark entities. There were a few stale phrases that could have used some sharp editing in here.

**A Lush and Seething Hell – By John Hornor Jacobs**

\*Prose: 10/10

\*Narrative: 8/10

\*Pace: 7/10

\*Fear Factor: 7/10

\*Horror elements: Torture & body horror; cosmic horror; monsters

Two excellent novellas by an up-and-coming author with a lot of promise. The stories are fairly intricate and difficult to summarize here, but I really enjoyed Jacobs writing style. The characters are fresh and relatable, and the historical-political settings were interesting to read about. There’s a strong cosmic horror element behind his writing, but it only peeks out occasionally, and much is left to the imagination regarding the “horror” here.

**The Library at Mount Char – by Scott Hawkins**

\*Prose: 10/10

\*Narrative: 9/10

\*Pace: 9/10

\*Fear Factor: 5/10

\*Horror elements: torture, cruelty toward children, demons, sexual violence

I’ll finish with one of my other favorites of the year.  I’m not certain this novel even qualifies as “horror,” as it’s really more about magical realism. The story follows a group of orphans adopted by a god-like “Father,” who resides in a mythical library of knowledge. We learn that it’s hard to earn Daddy’s approval, and when Father gets angry, things start smoking.  I found this premise so unique, and the caliber of writing so exceptional, that I couldn’t put this down. If you’re looking to stray a bit outside the realm of horror, this might be a good stepping stone for you.

Thanks, and I hope you enjoyed!

Edit 2 - Thank you for the positive feedback.  I will try to do this more often, and I hope others are inspired to do the same!  I feel the need, in retrospect, to explain why I ranked ""A Short Stay in Hell"" as 10/10 on fear factor.  I think a lot of new readers will pick up this novel, finish it in 2 days, and wonder what the fuss was about.  It is not an altogether frightening read; in fact, the narrative voice is almost humorous.  But I personally find the idea of eternity more terrifying than any evil monsters, clowns, or cosmic gods. The scale of ""infinity"" is depicted here in a way that left me feeling so unsettled, I couldn't shake the feeling for weeks (and I still can't).  In short, this book still haunts me.",horrorlit

Hello everyone, sorry I have been absent for so long. Looking over the mod mail and my private messages it has come to my attention that the HOWL Society has engaged in an astroturfing campaign on this thread to promote their upcoming release AND this is not the first time this has occurred. Evidence is attached.

In the past we have afforded the HOWL society limited leeway due to their origin as a r/HorrorLit book club. When they moved into publishing they were given slight leeway again considering their origins as a r/HorrorLit community movement.

This is by far the most brazen betrayal of trust that this community and myself has ever experience. I am disgusted by the underhandedness and corruption that these users engaged in to circumvent our community's rules and mission. This act betrays the very foundation of what this community is about and how it operates. r/HorrorLit has been, is not, and never will be a community for people to use as their own billboards to promote and benefit themselves.

If anyone finds more users that have engaged in this astroturfing campaign please contact me immediately.

With regards,

1667251235.0,What’s up with Richard Laymon and lack of dicks?,"I bought the audiobook of Flesh because of a glowing recommendation I read here. I don’t know if this particular book just isn’t my style and he wrote it for some particular type of person, or I’m out of touch with the horror genre, or what. I gave it an honest chance, I really did.

But a handful of chapters in and he still can’t get past the lack of cocks. Not a single chapter can go by without a cock and/or balls not being weirdly involved in some way or another. A goth running around without a boner and being given a history of the Aztec priesthood in the middle of the street isn’t particularly scary- it’s laughable, in context.

After all the one-dimensional women, lack of hard dicks, and bad stereotype Goth accents (for the audiobook at least) I’m a little irritated I wasted an Audible credit here. It’s the first thing I’ve ever archived so that I don’t have to look at it in my library anymore.

Edit: man, this post has gotten the weirdest response of anything I’ve ever posted. I’ve gotten a lot of downvotes, but not a single person has actually defended this book or it’s content so far. Literally nobody has had anything positive to say about the book itself.

The best I’ve heard so far is “he’s dead”.

The worst I’ve heard is “it’s not his best work” as if that has anything to do with it. I literally would not have known that if nobody said it. I’m judging the work on it’s own merits, and it’s not a good work by any merit I can measure.

It may be someone’s cup of tea, and I respect that. But horror? Oof.

Edit 2: we’re at over 15 comments, and still nobody has had anything positive to say about this book, despite the comment downvotes and irrelevant defenses of the author. I hope that someone months from now reads this post and skips out on this book, saving their money or at the very least an audible credit.


Edit 3: we’re at 30+ comments, and I’ve seen nothing but the most tepid, second hand approval of this book. Almost all of the praise for the author has centered around his lack of cocks rather than his boobie writing prowess. Take that for what you will.",horrorlit

What an absolutely near-perfect book. It really makes me wish that Mike Flanagan didn’t basically change everything that made the book so unique when he constructed his adaptation - because while he borrows certain elements from the book, it’s basically Haunting of Hill House in name only. 

I didn’t really know much going into the book, beyond having watched the tv series and being really keen on reading the source. For a book written in the 60’s, I was surprised by how often the novel felt so modern, with little glimpses of the 60’s - Eleanor and Theodora were well written, strong characters - as were all the characters, to be honest. 

It constantly surprises me how critical the first 30 pages are in regards to me continuing or potentially DNFing the book entirely - as I did with Station 3 - with Hill House, I just soaked it in and was left wanting more.

For me it's *haunted houses*! The creaking doors, the fleeting shadows, the strange sounds, the muffled footsteps, the hidden chambers, the disturbed pasts, and warnings written in blood to ""get out"", but the hapless characters with nowhere else to go...I cannot get enough of it.

It could be any setting, a jungle, a dessert, The Wild West,  A city, a rural town, etc.  I'm more concerned about the feeling, the writing, the eeriness, the horror of not knowing, and just an overall good story.

I've gotten to the point where horror is beginning not to scare me, or the writer seems to go for cheap scares instead of the tension and horror that builds and builds.

1622033923.0,"Hello fellow horror readers, I want to suggest The Passage by Justin Cronin. For anyone who is a fan of vampires/zombies and like long apocalyptic epic novels like The Stand or Swan Song.","This book teeters on horror the same way novels like The Stand does. I see it mentioned here very infrequently and wanted to put it out there for people looking for a new novel. It's a phenomenal book with some pretty spooky tension filled scenes. Without spoiling too much, here's a quick synopsis.

It starts off in your standard apocalyptic way; a virus escapes and everything is forever changed. The beginning covers how it broke loose from the facility. Then, this is where it changes things up: The book immediately jumps forward 93 years later to a post-virus ravaged world where survivors have set up camps with walls and fortresses to keep ""them"" out. Think of it as the movie ""The Village"" where people literally live their whole lives within this mini society scared of what lurks beyond the walls. The problem is, they're running out of resources to keep the camps and fortified walls functioning, along with a growing desire to see what lies beyond. 

The book was never promoted as horror possibly because horror doesn't sell as well as mainstream novels, but make no mistake. There are some pretty scary scenes in this book. I really, really enjoyed it and wanted to recommend it to this community since it touches down on so many topics many enjoy from apocalyptic scenes, viruses, vampire monsters, and the adventure story akin to The Stand. Hope someone sees this and enjoys a great read!",horrorlit

Here is my review after reading a ton of them.","[Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/bf16yj/found_footage_style_recommendations/) the original thread for your reference. I read most of these throughout last year, so I'm happy to answer any questions for anyone interested but my pea brain is losing the memories a bit. Instead of a 5 star rating, I'll just use ""Must Recommend,"" ""Could Recommend,"" and ""Don't Recommend.""

**Fantasticland by Mike Bockoven - Must Recommend**, *if* you are comfortable with a bit of silliness in your books and you like another rehashing of Lord of the Flies . I listened to the audiobook, which had a variety of voice actors. There is definitely a great amount of straight-up horror in this one, but the setting and pseudo-tribalism of the teenagers, in my opinion, give this one a silly edge that makes it that more readable.

**The Troop by Nick Cutter - Must Recommend,** *if* you love visceral gore and are *still* interested in rehashing Lord of the Flies. I just seem to eat books like this up. Nick Cutter really *brought* *me there* with the gore, which I can always appreciate.

**Last Days by Adam Nevill -** **Could Recommend,** *if* you like action setpieces in your horror books. This one was a dud for me >!mostly because of the ending, and the weak use of found footage elements. !<That being said... who doesn't love cults? I know this one is recommended on the sub a lot for that reason, and I think anyone who is thirsty for a cult book should definitely pick it up.

**Night Film by Marisha Pessel** \- **Don't Recommend,** *if* you are bothered racist/transphobic character depictions or >!disappointingly vague endings. !<That being said - one of the better uses of found footage elements of the books listed here! A lot of people love this book so take my opinion with a grain of salt.

**S. by Doug Dorst - Could Recommend,** *if* you are dying to have a TRUE ""found"" elements experience. Honestly, the story didn't grab me but I am just so happy to have this on my shelf. It's not really horror.  If you like House of Leaves, I bet you'd like this too.

**The Last Days of Jack Sparks - Could Recommend**, *if* you dig unlikable narrators and a bit of goofiness. This is a more supernatural in nature, but I am a sucker for anything demonic/possession related. The plot is a tad messy, but I thought it was fun.

**Lost in the Dark by John Langan** \- **Must Recommend**, *if* you are down to read a short story that is pretty creepy, very original, and kinda realistic. I can't say I liked the whole anthology (Best Horror of the Year Volume 10), but this was basically what I *wanted* Night Film to be.

**Lake Mungo** \- **Must Recommend,** *if* you actually just want to watch a fucking amazing found footage movie. Holy shit is this one great. Go watch it. Now.

**The Power by Naomi Alderman - Could Recommend,** *if* you don't even want to read horror at all, but love this style of epistolary novel and want some female-centered science fiction in your life.

There were quite a few that I started that were recommended but I didn't finish, which is less to say that the book is bad and more that I wasn't vibing with it when I picked it up:  
\- We Eat Our Own  
\- Wylding Hall  
\- The Dead House

Today, I just finished Hangsaman, and my god. I just can't get over it. It is truly one of the most bizarre stories I've ever read and I think it's going to haunt my mind possibly forever. I don't know what it was about this one in particular that just sealed the deal, but I am just in complete awe of what Shirley Jackson is able to do with pen and paper. There is a particular scene in this book that had me almost shaking in bed last night while I was reading, and I honestly don't even think I can explain why. Trying to describe why this book impacted me so much just leaves me at a loss for words. I think maybe it's this inability to explain or fully comprehend that has me so entranced with her work, it really does feel like it was written in a parallel universe that is very similar to ours, but is just slightly ""off"". I'm excited to read her other works, I think The Sundial is next on the docket.

Birthday (1999) 

S (2012)

(I ruin the ending and everything)
Just wanted to voice my feels about this book. 
This is really REALLY long because I’ve been thinking about it a lot. 

I’ve noticed that a lot of readers feel betrayed by Marcos at the end, and I was trying to figure out why that was. I was really struggling with this because throughout the book, I had this weird feeling about him and I was trying to figure out why. I had a feeling that he would betray Jasmine and I think I realized why we are so betrayed or felt his “change of heart” was so sudden.

Throughout the book, we get a sense of all the atrocities human beings commit against each other. We even get a sense of empathy from Marcos about his world which makes us as readers feel like he thinks the way we do. However, we are fooled into believing that anything he did for Jasmine was out of empathy, because that is exactly how he tricked Jasmine. He actually uses everything he learned from working at the Center in order to get what he wanted from Jasmine. He fooled her by treating her human ENOUGH to get what he wanted. A baby.

-We knew that Marcos wasn’t interested in Jasmine for sex/lust because he hooks up with Spanel in a more graphic scene. However, there is no “scene” for when he assaults Jasmine because it’s not about the sex. He simply says that what he wants to do is prohibited but he does it anyway. We think that he’s talking about wanting to have sex with Jasmine, but what he really wanted was just to inseminate her himself to get the baby. 

-We knew that Marcos was never a hero. We even saw another Processing Center worker try to free the farmed humans. Marcos never did anything like that and he ultimately rapes Jasmine. He never feels remorse for raping her either. So, there was no reason for us to think that he would be any type of hero or the good guy.

-It is mentioned that Stunners each have a secret to calming head before they knock them out. By the end, we know that Marcos has his own way, which is singing Jasmine a song. This shows that he had been using methods he learned at work to use on Jasmine, but we (and Jasmine) confused these behaviors with empathy or compassion. 

-It is also mentioned multiple times that pregnant females are aggressive, so aggressive and vicious that they are used for hunting, or that they need to be amputated because they might try to kill their babies so they don’t get eaten. I kept wondering why this was talked about so much when Jasmine isn’t aggressive at all during the pregnancy. This is because, she is fooled into feeling safe with Marcos. We think she is being treated like a normal person, when in reality, Marcos takes out furniture and locks her in her room to keep her from hurting the baby. She is still trapped in a cage, it’s just that the cage is full of hugs and songs. When he talks about her, it’s about “the child, his child” not HER. He never had any plans with her in them, just the baby. He knew that the only way to keep the baby safe was to make Jasmine feel safe. 

-We think that Marcos is somehow different from everyone else, but the whole book shows how he adheres to societal standards and that these standards mean absolutely nothing. All rules are broken anyway. We think that he is helping Jasmine when he gives her a name, because humans with names are considered people who have rights and aren’t food. But we see that even people “with a first and last name” are abused, assaulted, and eaten because of human trafficking. Even people with rights can sacrifice themselves to become food. 

All humans are essentially the same. The only difference is how they’re treated. The only way you can tell farmed humans from normal ones is their branding and lack of vocal cords. This is why Marcos’ child will be able to live a normal life. He wont be raised in captivity. At the end, Marcos said “she had the human look of a domesticated animal” and I kept getting hung up on this and what it meant. It’s not that she was a human who looked like an animal. The whole book is about humans being treated like livestock. Jasmine was always an animal to him, a domesticated animal, but at the end, Jasmine looked human.",horrorlit

1667495614.0,"looking for ""good for her"" fiction","people always talk about ""good for her"" movies, but i am looking for more horror/thriller books that fit this niche genre! for those unfamiliar, here is a quick definition of the ""good for her"" trope from an article on [citivas-stl](https://www.civitas-stl.com/midsommar-and-the-good-for-her-trope/):

>This trope refers to **a belittled or traumatized woman in media gaining her autonomy back through horrific acts of vengeance that leave the audience feeling a twisted sense of vindication**

it doesn't necessarily have to be horror, but my favorite stories like this usually are. some books i've already read (and enjoyed) that fit the bill:

* goddess of filth by v. castro
* mary: an awakening of terror by nat cassidy
* carrie by stephen king
* they never learn by layne fargo

the more gruesome, the better. i'm open to just about anything.

EDIT:  i just want to clarify that the protagonist doesn't necessarily have to have been wronged or be justified in her actions - one commenter referred to the trope as ""violence feminism"" and i think that's more on the nose than my initial description. women doing bad things because fuck the patriarchy - or something like that. lol

EDIT 2: this has nothing to do with midsommar. yes i am aware that the article cited was about the movie - i simply liked their definition of the trope, i was not trying to use the movie itself as an example. hence why i gave BOOK examples of the kind of story i was looking for. thx

For instance, The Troop was rather boring to me, gross out scares don’t create that tension for me. Neither did House of Leaves. Great concept and very unique but just didn’t have that “wow” factor when I was reading it. Just looking for books you absolutely loved in your top 3 that contained that creep factor. 

**For what it’s worth, I’ve cleared out Stephen King and Dan Simmons. I’ve seen “Between Two Fires” getting a lot of praise on here lately and been thinking about giving that a go.**",horrorlit

Starting around oh, 8, maybe 9, scary stories became more and more what I was drawn to. So many nights spent rebelling against bedtime by sneaking a book under the covers, or hiding in the crawl space next to my bedroom reading about witches or ghosts. And now, I’m in my 50’s and still end every night reading in bed (albeit usually on a Kindle instead of a paperback), and lying there in the dark reading a horror story I’m not an achy older adult with adult worries and problems, I’m ageless and nothing matters but the story.

I had to put some books back, but they had some great titles I had been meaning to dig into and some really cool indie stuff. A nice mix of new and used, with great prices.

I picked up:
Haunted by James Herbert

Described as a Horror/Fantasy novel with a hypnotic poetic style of writing, I have to say I have never read anything quite like it.  Yes I have read horror stories involving carnivals and funfairs, I love them BUT I have never read anything in the style that Ray Bradbury writes.  It's absolutely mesmerising.  The words and expressionism he uses are captivating, magical even.  You are indeed hypnotised by it. And the characters - Mr Dark, Mr Cooger and their clan are spectacular; how the tents are erected, the balloon, the carousel - just everything is nothing that I have ever had the pleasure to read about before.  There is true magic in this book, I feel so grateful to have been able to read and enjoy it.

1666226910.0,Things about horror you HATE,"What are some things about horror that you hate, specifically in the context of looking for horror to read?

I get really frustrated because I like such niche things that it’s often a real chore to find anything to read in genres I want. So for funsies, these are things I hate when searching.

1) Series. I think horror is usually best done in self-contained books, so nothing drives a stake through my desire to read a horror novel than seeing “Book 1 in the _______ series.” I have read some that I enjoyed (The Strain), but do you notice they’re always some different genre more than pure horror (dark fantasy, sci-fi, action, etc.?)

2) “Humans are the real monsters.” Yeah, yeah, I get it: humans can be awful. But how about we let the monsters be the real monsters occasionally? I don’t mind human antagonists (how would IT have worked without Henry and the gang?), don’t get me wrong: just get annoyed when human antagonists are the *main* focus.

3) “Not horror per se, but…” When asking for suggestions, someone always does this. I know they’re trying to be helpful and to share something that might be good, but it’s ultimately not helping to get closer to finding a suitable horror read.

4) “Did anything supernatural even happen?” I understand that psychological horror is its own entire genre, but nothing turns me off more than reading in a synopsis, “but is it all just in her mind?” or something similar. This is a personal idiosyncrasy, but I want to finish a book and think, “yes, the supernatural spooky stuff was very definitely real.”",horrorlit

1647789233.0,The Troop is one of the most disgusting books I've ever read and enjoyed,"After reading “The Troop” by Nick Cutter, I can honestly tell you it was a brilliant horror novel that ended up being a genuine page-turner. From the creepy descriptions to some insanely gross situations, I legit made all sorts of freaked out faces while reading as I could not put this book down. I usually don't read these kinds of books but wow, I was pleasantly surprised!

Cutter has an amazing writing style that you can relate with thanks to all the unique characters, what makes them stand out, and have everything be instantly relatable. The thing that truly freaked me out was how detailed the various encounters were as you read. Besides the main story that is taking place, you’ll find everything from lab research reports, trials, and other unique aspects of an insane backstory that was a very smart way to deliver what is truly going on.

I’ve read a ton of horror novels in my life but this one takes the cake for being scary, disgusting, and well, one frightening read from start to finish. The way it was built up literally came out of nowhere as things unraveled to the point where it started to actually be believable because of how realistic things ended up being. That’s very hard to do in a horror novel and added a nice dimension of reality to keep things even scarier.

I give “The Troop” by Nick Cutter a 5/5 because it’s absolutely fantastic. It takes a lot for a book to freak me the hell out on top of grossing me out and this one does it ten-fold. The ending left me satisfied as it’s definitely one rollercoaster of a ride with many emotions throughout. I'm curious to hear if others also found this to be disgustingly great because my goodness, to me, it was!",horrorlit

1629132096.0,Gatekeeping in Horror,"I'm sorry for the rant, but I'm getting really tired of the gatekeeping that I occasionally see on here and in other corners of the horror lit community. I'm talking about people appointing themselves as the arbiters of what is and what isn't horror. And all too often, they use a subjective (and toxically masculine) test of ""Does it scare *me*?"" As in, ""I'm tough, and I want to be *scared*! And if it doesn't scare *me*, it isn't horror!""

A couple of thoughts. First - who gives a shit? If an author describes their work as horror, and it is scary to some portion of the population, how is it any skin off your back for them to call it horror?

Second, these gatekeepers are usually straight white men. I'm a white man, but I'm not straight, and I can tell you, things are scary to me that wouldn't be scary to a straight man. Same goes for people of color, women, gender-non-conforming folks, etc. We are all scared by different things. Just because something doesn't frighten *you* doesn't mean it isn't horrifying to someone.

1632241338.0,What horror trope are you tired of?,"For me it has gotta be scary clowns. I feel like I have never known clowns to be not scary. I've grown up in a time when Pennywise, Violator and The Joker are more prominent than any positive depictions of clowns, save for maybe Ronald McDonald. Even Krusty is chain-smoking and cynical. I can't connect or relate to the childhood whimsy that scary clowns corrupt and subvert. I find the image of a clown carrying a bloodied axe as unsurprising as one carrying a balloon. It's an idea that's old hat, and rarely in horror films or books do I find that a scary clown serves as anything more interesting than a frightening image. It's like Dracula in a high-collared, black cape, or Frankenstein's Monster with bolts in his neck. It's past iconic, it's familiar and mundane. What was once horrific about the character and the imagery has been diluted. 

There are exceptions, of course, like The Pilo Family Circus, which I am reading now and finding to be alot of fun.

Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of novels that I've really enjoyed (The Haunting of Hill House, Dracula, Salem's Lot, etc) but a lot of other times I feel the more extensive format doesn't work quite well with horror.
I've always thought horror is the genre that better suits the short story genre because it relies on your most basic instincts in order to generate fear, shock, repulsion, etc.

Argentine writer Julio Cortázar once said referring to the difference between writing a novel and a short story that the novel has to win by points and the short story by knockout.

1651360625.0,The “It’s not horror if it doesn’t scare me personally” issue. Again.,"I’d like to talk about pebbles. Just a few pebbles in a laughing baby’s hand on a lovely June day.

That’s one of the most horrifying moments in horror fiction to me, but I admit, the first time I read it, it didn’t hit me.

That’s why I think we need to rethink the gatekeeping I’ve seen about horror, especially horror that isn’t immediately obvious, like the pebbles in the laughing baby’s hand.

We can all appreciate a good sewer clown, a tentacled space god, a pinhead. Those are iconic. But they’re not the only dish of the horror buffet. Sometimes, the best horror is the kind you thought was sweet and safe until you get up to pee or something at three in the morning and realize what you’ve really been looking at the whole time.

The world rocks on its axis a bit. It destabilizes a bit. Maybe a lot. Things are no longer safe, even our neighbors or friends or a bright June day. 

That, my fiends, is also horror. Deep horror. And though quieter and less bloody, no less horrific than Cthulhu or Jack Torrance or Freddy. 

The moment that made me realize this is, as I mentioned, those stones in a laughing baby’s hand at the end of one of the most justly famous horror stories out there, Shirley Jackson’s The Lottery. 

They’re put there by a neighbor so he can throw them. At his mother. To help stone her to death. As one does.

1703709675.0,Read “The Slob”. Wish I hadn’t. Here’s my opinion and a synopsis so you don’t have to.,"Spoilers. Spoilers. SPOILERS. I wanted to foray into extreme horror, and I decided to spend $15 on thriftbooks to get a copy of The Slob. I wish I had my $15 and/or the three hours it took me to read it, back. I expected gratuitous violence, I expected sexual assault wouldn’t be flinched away from. What I didn’t expect was crappy writing. What I expected and didn’t get, was scared. It was boring and badly written. Literally just shock value. Going into depth about how diseased and slimy and sickly this guys dick looks isn’t scary lmao it’s just gross. Also the ending felt like something he tacked onto the end just to try to make it seem like there’s more depth to his book than there actually is.

So do you want to know the majority of nastiness that happens in this book? Let’s go:

>!•Vera grew up in a hoarded home and had to clean up a family members suicide aftermath !<

>!•Vera grows up, gets a man, gets pregnant. !<

>!•Decides to be a door to door carpet cleaner saleswoman because she knows about cleaning and money is good. Her man worries she’ll get hurt. 🙄 !<

>!•Last day, last sale cliche. Last house she decides to try is THE SLOBS •a few pages dedicated to how disgusting he and his house are. !<

>!• she asks for his nastiest carpet to try the carpet cleaner in, he takes her to a back bedroom and tells her to “clean up” a dismembered woman. !<

>!•Vera has fucked up !<

>!•Slob beats the shit out of her, she cleans up the gore, he brings her a plate of cooked, bone-in  “meat” that’s obviously human. !<

>!•Vera says “oh no thanks I’m not hungry” so he beats her into unconscious !<

>!•Vera wakes up tied to the bed with the 🍖 shoved in her hooha. !<

>!• he takes the meat out and describes the specific pregnancy slime on it, makes Vera eat it by twisting her exposed nasal bone. !<

>!DONT READ BEYOND HERE IF YOU'RE SENSITIVE TO BABY STUFF!<

>!•the he asks her if she wants dessert. This is when the book gets absurd in its violence. He purées her unborn baby by beating her abdomen with a 25lb dumbbell. THEN reaches up in her, grabs the mangled fetus, and force feeds it to her. After, he crams the hose from the carpet cleaner up inside to boil her vag and uterus for good measure.!<

>! •she passes out, comes to with another lady in the room with a bag over her head. Sandra? I already don’t remember. !<

>!•Sunny Sandra has had her scalp removed, and her lips torn off and sewn to her “lady lips” but is still chummy enough to cook up an escape plan with Vera. !<

>!•they stage it so it looks like they killed each other. Slob drags Sandra away and Vera sneakily follows and unlocks the gun cabinet with a key smuggled in Sandra’s poop. !<

>!•Vera follows Slob to the barn where he’s fucking Sandra’s “corpse” and you get a real nice description of his infected syphilis dick and elephantiasis ballsack. !<

>!• Vera aims at the Slob but “God must love lemonade” bc she blows Sandra away instead RIP. 🫡 !<

>!•so now Vera spends “weeks” chained in his cage of corpses in the barn being repeatedly beaten and assaulted. In this barn, Slob turns his dozens of female victims into cans of TYG. Aka Tender Young Girl, which is his fave food obvi. He’s too fat to fuck effectively so he ends up throwing up on Vera as he climaxes. !<

>!• Vera decides enough is enough and starts maiming corpses for booby trap parts. She comes up with a handful of teeth and a pointy bone. !<

>!• Slob comes in, goes to fuck Vera and impales his penis on the bone she’s hiding in her hootenanny. Then she slams the fistful of teeth in his mouth. Chase scene ensues and ends with her knocking him into the meat chopper and beheading him. Vera then drives home. !<

>!•MEAWHILE back at the Slobs barn, a Suited Man comes for the TYG delivery and finds Slob dead so he burns the whole place to the ground. !<

>!•Suit goes back to a cult of GAY MEN who eat women to “absorb their femininity and even the playing field” and tells them oops we’re out of TYG right as our fellow gay, cannibal from Japan is flying in to try some :C !<

>!•they order Mr. Japan some pizza instead 🤗 !<

>!• He likes the pizza!! ………..but still wants to eat humans. So he beheads all the gay servants into a bathtub and cooks their bodies and fucks off back to Japan !<

>!• also Vera is pregnant!<

1692614131.0,I read nine of your 'too disturbing' recommendations from the lists on this subreddit over the last month and here are my thoughts...,"Over the last few months I’ve really taken to reading as much as I possibly can. I fell into the rabbit hole of this subreddit and MY GOD it’s lovely here. More importantly I found the top threads of ‘too disturbing never again’ novels fascinating so thought I would have to delve in. I wanted to share my thoughts in case you guys could recommend some more!

******Penpal by Dathan Auerbach (4/5)******
This was one of the books people said stuck with them for a long time after reading it, that’s the kind of horror I love, where it evokes an emotion and leaves you thinking about it for days and weeks after. This was a great read, wonderfully written and the sporadic time jumps in the narrative really keeps your attention. It didn’t freak me out as much as it did make me sad for the characters but thoroughly recommend.

**Woom by Duncan Ralston (3/5)**
Jesus fucking christ. What even is this book. Well let me tell you! It’s a series of short stories woven between the meeting of a man and a woman in a sordid motel. I won’t go any further than that because spoilers but it was to put it simply, gross. I’m not a massive fan of horror that involves a lot of bodily fluids so this just grossed me out more than anything. It’s well told and there are some problematic writings of certain characters but overall if you want something that makes you go ‘I need to clean my brain’ this is it.

**Tender Is The Flesh by Agustina Bazterrica (3/5)**
This one was on every list on this subreddit and I can kind of see why. It’s dark and unrelenting, a post-apocalyptic novel I guess but where morals have been lost not human lives. It’s wonderfully written and the ending is dark as fuck but the characters don’t really go anywhere and it leaves you really wanting a lot more from it.

**The Troop by Nick Cutter (4/5)**
Another that is on a lot of the lists on here, and frankly I just really enjoyed it. Lord of the flies meets The Thing is the concept, but it stood out for me as I loved the writing style and how it drew you into the characters. Their backstories reflected the character arks beautifully and it had real humanity in it. There is a bit that will stick with me for ages (>!when one of the boys is cutting himself to get to the worm inside of him!<) and the ending is perfect too. Really recommended.

**Earthlings by Sayaka Murata (4/5)**
I had read Convenience Store Woman previously so I already knew that I loved Muratas writing style but this one blew me away. It’s wonderfully slow paced, about the relationship of a man and woman who don’t really believe in love. But once again the backstories of the characters draw you in and you end up rooting for them even though some of the things they are doing are pretty gross. Not as disturbing as it had been stated on here, I just felt sad for the characters after I had put the book down, but that’s what a good book is supposed to do, linger with you.

**Confessions by Kanae Minato (5/5)**
This book fucking rocked. It reminded me a lot of ‘Sympathy For Lady Vengeance’ but in this novel you are drawn into the villians backstories a lot more than the victims, and at points you end up feeling sorry for them. I won’t spoil the premise of this one, but if you love a good revenge horror then get this book immediately if not before.

**In The Miso Soup by Ryu Murakami (5/5)**
Audition is one of my favourite films ever made, so when I discovered this was the same author I couldn’t start it quick enough. A brilliant and brutal book that once again begins slowly but builds beautifully. The crescendo is harrowing but it really draws you into the characters but more importantly the city (mostly Kabukicho) in such a way you feel like you know the street corners. Think American Pyscho set in Shinjuku. Couldn’t recommend it more.

**No Longer Human by Junji Ito (Adapted from a work of Osamu Dazai) 5/5**
This was like a punch to the gut. Ito’s mangas have always been a favourite of mine and I hadn’t heard of this before and found it in my local library of all places. The story is that of a young man who has no identity, who can’t find himself and is in a constant battle of addiction and avoiding his pain. It rings true for anyone who has ever suffered with any mental health issues, but the way the story is told, the page turns to beautifully horrendous imagery and the ending, bloody hell fire.

**Goth by Otsuichi (5/5)**
As you can see I did fall down a bit of east Asian horror vibe here, but this book is BRILLIANT. The authors unique writing style and the way he paints the characters from the offset is fantastic. The premise is a series of short stories all about serial killers or murderers, and two high school students who keep finding themselves in the middle. There is one story about mysterious dog disappearances that I don’t think I will ever be able to forget.

Sorry for prattling on I just am really enjoying this genre and the surprises that come with it. Any recommendations for what I should read next would be greatly appreciated. Trying to build myself up to Penance by Minato and Cows by Stokoe next.",horrorlit

1699803938.0,"What's the most unique, weird or interesting horror book you ever read?","Hello everyone! I want to dive myself into horror lit but idk where I can't start. I'm looking for horror books that have a unique, different or a interesting propost. Any suggestions guys??",horrorlit
1667227862.0,"I read 13 horror novels for the month of October, and here is a short pitch for all of them!","So I've always been a fan of Horror, and tied with Fantasy it is probably my most-read genre. This year as a challenge for myself I decided to read 100 books (currently at 92!) and I decided to do a horror run to get me in a festive mood. The mix below is... unique... to say the least. I decided to leave my ratings out of this because I think each one was good in its own way. They are totally *not* in any ranking order in any way. 

Anyway, let's begin. 

1. **The Only Good Indians by Stephen Graham Jones**

Want a traditional Slasher mixed with a supernatural Elk Monster? Then look no further. *The Only Good Indians* also does the troupe of ""ancestral revenge"" really well. There is a lot about the life of an Indian, and what it means to grow up on a reservation, providing insight into culture *while* being scared. There is a lot of basketball. 

2. **Horrorstör by Grady Hendrix**

The first on this list I would call *Comedy Horror*. This is a campy novel, as Grady Hendrix can be a campy author. It is a wonderful take on the Haunted House stereotype done with the scariest of all things... *retail!* Run around following a fun main character trying to survive the night in an Ikea.

3. **Kaiju: Battlefield Surgeon by Matt Dinniman**

A Horror Lit-RPG, and a pillar in the genre. Extensive in length, this provides a very detailed and *fleshed* out world. This story mixes strife, loss, and suffering and blends them seemingly with giant monster battles, and otherworldy torture. This is not for the faint of heart, instead this is for anyone looking for a horrifyingly gross time.    

4. **The Twisted Ones by T Kingfisher**

A Horror book that will warm your heart. This is the story of a woman and her dog stopping and thwarting some ancient evil. This is the result of wonderfully dynamic characters meeting an Appalachian Horror. The terrors in here will leave you genuinely frightened, but the characters will be holding your hand along the way.   

5. **Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia**

I mean... The title does a pretty good job. A Mystery Thriller that turns horrific; this is a wonderful story about a strong female protagonist taking control in a House and Family that wants to control her. A steady and progressively unsettling sense of unease that will leave readers wanting to escape the Gothic home called High Place.

6. **Family Business by Jonathan Sims**

We all have to clean up after ourselves, but who does the cleaning after we're gone? That would be our depressive and lonely protagonist! This story follows an unreliable narrator slowly descending into madness, as an eldritch entity slowly taunts them. But all they want to do is clean up the blood from a recent building collapse... This story features a diverse cast, and strongly focuses on the idea of healing after death.

7.  **Tales from the Gas Station by Jack Townsend**

Another *Comedy Horror*, but one that will leave you trembling and wondering where all the emotions weld up from. Follow our terminally Ill protagonist as he works at a 24-hour gas station in a town frequented by *all* supernatural things. An Eldritch horror is trying to stop Jack, and all he wants to do is not have a crack-head pee in his bathroom (Which is home to a singing Ghost). A wonderful story for anyone who has worked retail, and needs a good laugh. 

8. **Fairy Tale by Stephen King**

A new King book!. This is a love letter to HP Lovecraft and the Grimm Brothers, and a beautifully written one at that. This is a story of a boy and his dog against the evils of a dark fairytale world. Imagine King deciding to write Alice in Wonderland and this is exactly what you get. All the fairytales from your youth will be seen dancing through these pages, bringing a sense of nostalgia, until you notice the slightly unsettling grin of Rumpelstiltskin.


9. **The Ruins by Scott Smith**

There is something more horrifying than actually uncovering ancient ruins filled with evil, and that’s the Human mind. This is a perfect psychological horror that aims to show how we as a species deal with traumatic situations. Follow four distinct victims as they try and survive the conditions of a perilous jungle. Also you gotta love the troupe of rich college kids not heading the warning of locals.

10. **Best Served Cold by Joe Abercrombie**

This is the only one on here that is technically a part of a larger universe. I do not think you *need* to read the original trilogy to appreciate this book, it is highly recommended though. This is a stand alone novel all about revenge. You will question what is right, *know* what is wrong, and still have the desire for them to get their revenge. This is THE BEST novel I’ve read where the main character/s decent into absolut evil, and this is also probably the most *hilarious* books about revenge. 

11. **The Fisherman by John Langan**

This story is about the grief of losing a loved one, and what one must give in order to get them back. This is a slow and seductive work filled with themes from HP lovecraft. There is dark magic, ancient evils, zombies, fish people, and even leviathans! Following two distinct timelines dealing with *The Fisherman* this story combines the two into an explosive finale that will leave the reading wanting to… just go fish, and clear their mind. 


12. **Piranesi by Susanna Clarke**

Join a scientist as he explores a desolate world of marble statues and ocean waves. This book is more of a psychological thriller than it is pure horror. The story telling excels in its use of an unreliable narrator; causing the reader to figure out the true mysteries of this world alongside one of the most lovable but forgetful protagonists. The horror comes from reading in between the lines for this one. 

13. **Uzumaki by Junji Ito**

Last but not least, a Manga! This story follows a towns descent into madness and pure abstract horror because of *Spirals*. This is beyond eldritch horror and extends into some form of madness that I found astonishing to have come from the mind of a human. The stark black and white contrasting images provide such stark and dynamic storytelling alongside the grossest and most horrific art you’ll ever see. Every page you turn will be a surprise, welcomed or not.",horrorlit
1658012951.0,Between Two Fires lives up to the hype.,"I’ve read a lot of the books recommended here and on horror lit FB groups like Penpal, Gone to See the River Man, The Troop, Woom, Dead Inside, etc. And while each of them were enjoyable (depending on your stomach), I wasn’t exceptionally blown away by any of them. Then I finished Between Two Fires today. 

It’s an absolutely amazing journey. The protagonists felt real and flawed but you still rooted for them. The story itself is riveting and intelligent and only aged better with Covid. It felt like Game of Thrones written with Catholic symbology. The book itself is a master class in plant/playoff. Almost every other line by Delphine is a set up for something later and there are callbacks to almost every major or minor event somewhere later in the book but it serves essential plot purpose. I kept thinking of “predestination” while reading. Each chapter felt like a mini adventure on its own building towards an end goal, which for those who have limited reading time makes it an excellent book to take chunks out of over time. I genuinely think this book should be adapted with a S1-4 GoT level care and budget. 

As for the horror, its outshined a few times by the fantasy elements but never totally lost. A certain chapter set in Hell is haunting, while other chapters featuring leviathan sized angels and demons taking apart the sky in battle will definitely scratch that cosmic horror itch. There’s also the actual living horror of living through the Black Death and the book does a great job immersing us in that world. One character is missing an eye because his father clawed it out, believing that the plague was passed through eye contact. It takes the plague seriously and it always is a concern in the story. 

Overall, I look forward to rereading it when the subtleties of the story escape me and I can be enraptured again. I’ve already purchased The Lesser Dead by Buehlman and will continue to keep an eye out for his work. If you find yourself underwhelmed by suggestions for your next read, I promise this one has something for you.",horrorlit

These aren’t necessarily the scariest scenes, just the ones that stuck to your brain long after you finished the book or story. 

Here are just a few of mine:

- The Mangler, Stephen King short story: Yes, this is the one about the killer laundry appliance. 🤣 There’s a brief few lines of dialogue toward the beginning of this book, where the police describe the state of the first victim’s body, which was carried out in a small basket. That bit of gruesome content was so visceral to me when I read it as a teenager and it stuck with me ever since. Because instead of showing exactly how the accident happened (which would eventually transpire), King simply implied that the damage was such that this is what a human body was reduced to. My imagination did the rest. 

- Jaws- and it’s none of the super graphic scenes you’d expect! Both in the film and the book adaptation, I cannot stomach the scene where the mother let’s her son go play in the water, and then she has this moment—this god awful moment where she is searching for him in the water and doesn’t see him. And we know the shark has a victim and we know it is her son, but SHE doesn’t know yet and this just crushed me for some reason. Now that I’m a mom of a young child I feel that pain even more. Because if that’s not horror— not being able to find your child in the midst of a terrifying event— then nothing is. 

The Shining, Stephen King - Those mf topiaries man. Anything with the topiaries and I was sleeping with the lights on that night! 

I have quite a few more, and I’m realizing now that most of them have come out of Stephen Kings short stories. The Mist, Lunch at the Gotham Cafe, Mile 88, and this one that I can’t seem to recall the name of (my husband and I listened to it on audiobook), but it was about some crazy disturbing runes or rock formations.

I look forward to hearing what scene stayed with you!",horrorlit

1595802187.0,"Haunting of Hill House - why did I wait this long to read this book, it is amazing","Maybe I was afraid that it was written in the 50s and it will be outdated. Once you get into it and get used to the language (maybe was a bit harder for me, not a native speaker), it is a remarkably ageless story. Eleanor's thoughts really highlight that people 70 years ago were exactly the same as us, just in different circumstances.

This book was devastating without having anything happen for shock value. I felt such empathy for Eleanor, and Shirley Jackson played with my emotions, made me hate Theo by the end, even though she was my favorite character.

The unspoken sexuality and gender themes were great, nothing said and everything clear. The loneliness and mental health aspect, trying to fit in with people much more privileged than you, so realistically written.

I watched the series (loved it) and knew the book was a smaller, completely different story and different style, written from just one point of view spanning a few days not decades. The two can't really be compared as one, both are great for different reasons.

Cannot recommend it enough, but don't expect a ghost story, don't expect the ""scariest book ever"", it is an introspective, emotional character study with sad and scary elements.",horrorlit

Most of the cons people have about it, are the whole “story within a story” aspect, but I personally loved it, it provided a depth to the story that I haven’t experienced in years. You truly care for these characters. A surprising mix of sadness (a couple a tearful moments to be honest), straight horror, and then some heavy lovecraftian aspects all lend this to be one of the best books I’ve read in a very long time.

Because why not? Remember, enjoyment is subjective; I may have hated your favorite book, and I may have loved your most hated book. Feel free to tell me why my opinion sucks, and if you have any recommendations similar to the books I loved, shoot! Going from worst to best:

**Didn't like**

*The Black Farm* \- Pretty well-liked book, but didn't work for me. The writing felt extremely amateur and like emo wish-fulfillment: the women existed to be saved by our beast male character, and everything was just really stupid.

*Zombie* (Oates) - For being about a serial killer, this book was sure boring as fuck.

*Heart-Shaped Box* \- DNF 50%. Felt cliche, the writing juvenille. I don't think Hill is a bad author - I fucking love Horns - I just thought this one was a miss.

*The Glassy, Burning Floor of Hell* \- Not a terrible short story collection, but certainly not great. Most of the stories are super short and super lackluster. To Breathe the Air is probably the longest story, and it's definitely the best; I enjoyed it a lot more than the rest. The rest are forgettable.

*The Turtle Boy* \-  Forgettable horror novella. Wasn't terrible, but felt like it was missing something.

*Widow's Point* \- Forgettable horror novella. Cool idea, didn't love the execution.

*The Night Parade* \- I read 4 Malfi books this year, this one being the most recent, and this was the only one I disliked. I have little tolerance for idiot characters, and I found David to be a complete moron - his 8 year old daughter was waaaaaaay smarter than him, and they honestly should've died a bunch of times because of his incompetence, but main character plot armor. DNF'd at 50%.

**Enjoyed**

*A Cosmology of Monsters* \- I enjoyed reading this book a lot, and there's a ton of great moments, but ultimately this book left a sour taste in my mouth. It takes a bad turn that feels like complete wish-fulfillment, and it paints abusive behavior in a good light.

*Come Closer* \- A very readable possession story. Didn't hate anything about it, didn't love anything about it.

*Fragments of Horror* (manga) - Junji Ito is pretty hit or miss for me. This was an okay collection, nothing too terrible, nothing too great. Too much *Women Scary* as a theme for me though; Japanese culture can be hella weird (and the other Japanese book on this list only cements that more lol).

*Amygdalatropolis* \- Had way too high expectations because of Yeager's newer work, *Negative Space*, but this was still a good and super fucked up novel, albeit difficult to understand sometimes.

*The Laws of the Skies* \- sorta like a more fucked up Lord of the Flies but with six year olds. Easy read and brutal, but requires quite a lot of suspension of disbelief.

*The Beauty* \- Pretty wild novella. Became too heavy-handed in its message, but over all really interesting.

*Woom* \- Super fucked up and well written. Honestly a great novella, but certainly not fun to read lol.

*Between Two Fires* \- Don't kill me. I liked this book, just didn't love it. Religious horror just doesn't work for me 9/10 times, but there's a ton of great parts about this book, and the two main characters were great.

*Beneath a Pale Sky* \- A good short story collection, but also quite a disappointment. There wasn't a bad story in the collection, but if you've read his previous collection, *Behold the Void*, then you'll probably be disappointed, because that collection is AMAZING, and this one is only Good.

*She Said Destroy* \- Super odd short stories. Really liked this one at first, but got bored of the stories toward the end. Definitely one of the most unique collections I've read, big props for that.

*The Vorrh* \- For how much I absolutely hated this book, it sure is pretty high on this list. This one is just so hard to explain my feelings toward. Some parts are BRILLIANT - vivid, well described, interesting as hell. Other parts are terrible and sexist and just weird.

*The Croning* \- Definitely my least favorite Barron book I've read, but it's still good, and I suspect I might think it's great once I reread it. Very disjointed and confusing, but nothing this author has written is bad, and this one is no exception. The beginning is awesome but I didn't feel like the later parts reached the same height.

*Earthlings* \- This book is just wild. It's so heavy-handed and some parts are downright stupid, but it's also compulsively readable and fun in a miserable way.

*December Park* \- really fun coming-of-age murder-mystery tale. Not too much horror. Great characters, okay mystery.

*Gone to See the River Man* \- this book is one fucked up ride. Super well written and interesting.

*Amatka* \- this book isn't really horror, moreso Weird. Really surreal and uncomfortable book. Ending is kind of lackluster, but everything else is really interesting.

*There is No Antimemetics Division* \- This book was an absolute mindfuck at first, and some of it is truly horrifying. There's a great feeling when you can tell an author is way smarter than you, and this book totally me want to read his other work. However, I also didn't finish this book - DNF'd at 80%. Honestly, I didn't care how it ended because it got a little too ridiculous - got the point where it could end in any possible way and it would be just as believable. Just too much was introduced. So it lost steam for me and I stopped caring, but still an awesome concept, unlike anything else I've read, and good writing overall.

*The Summer I Died* \- this book is fuuuuuucked up. So compulsively readable though - I finished it in one sitting. Some parts are stupid, but I didn't really care. The characters are great, and it's truly a miserable book.

*Skidding into Oblivion* \- the ""companion piece"" (though I don't really see it) short story collection to Brian Hodge's God-tier cosmos horror novel *The Immaculate Void*. I won't lie, I found this collection a bit disappointing because of the insane expectations I had because of *TIV*, but this collection was still awesome. Some stories are so unique, and all have great characters.

*The Elementals* \- my first McDowell book. Great characters and a really interesting horror aspect. I didn't like this one as much as the other McDowell books I read, but it was still good.

*Cold Moon Over Babylon* \- I HATED this book while reading: it's so stressful and some of the characters - especially the sheriff - are so fucking incompetent. But it's really a great book: so depressing, with great characters and a truly fucked up villain.

*Bone White* \- My first Malfi book. The atmosphere in this book is killer; the sense of something being wrong with the town on point. I liked the horror element but was also kind of disappointed with it at the end (but not too disappointed). This is an excellent winter horror book.

* *City of Saints and Madmen

*This Thing Between Us* \- Just gunna say, this book has one of my favor covers ever (it doesn't matter, but it's honestly why I picked up the book in the first place lol). The main horror element of this book I found a little weak, but everything else was excellent, and some of the actual horror scenes themselves were scary as hell. The characters in this book, and the theme of grief, are amazing. If you want a horror book with great passages about alienation and what it's like to lose someone you love, this one is excellent.

*The Skinner* \- this is the first book I've read from Neal Asher. It's primarily a sci-fi novel, and part of a huge sci-fi epic, but ho boy does it have horror elements. The whole planet of Spatterjay is nuts and terrifying; the big baddy - the titular Skinner - is nightmare fuel. This is just a real great book that has multiple different threads, multiple different - very different, like different species - characters, and they all weave together well by the end.

*The Narrows* \- the second Mafli book I read and definitely my favorite. This book just did everything well - characters, horror, pacing, ending. It's a vampire book, but totally not a typical one. The characters are really, really good, and the monsters are scaaary.

*Starfish* (P Watts) - primarily a sci-fi novel, but man this book is bleak - yet also strangely beautiful. *Blindsight* is one of my all time favorite novels, and I'd been putting this one off for a while because I haven't been able to focus on difficult novels and thought this one would be inaccessible based on Watts's writing. The setting of this novel is amazing - the ocean depths - and the characters are damaged as hell and really well written, while also not being overly written at all - very minimalist feeling. 

*Entropy in Bloom* \- best short story collection I've read this year. I read some of *In The River* as well, but it started to get weird and I just didn't enjoyed it. I was worried I wouldn't like this collection based on my experience with that novella, but wow was I wrong. This is a **weird**, varying collection, and almost every story is awesome. The characters and themes are top fucking notch - many of the themes being breaking your humanity and ascending to something *strange.*

**All-time favorites**

*Blackwater Saga* \- McDowell's Southern Gothic epic. Truly an epic; these 1000 pages just flew by for me. Spans a whole generation, filled with amazing characters, loving and hateful family trauma, and really horrifying but subtle horror. The horror is sprinkled sparingly throughout, but man, when it hits, *it hits*.  The highlight is definitely the characters (team Eleanor all the way).

* *Stonefish*

*The Cormorant* \- read this on a whim because I like cormorants lol. Turns out, this is actually a fucking amazing little horror book! This book has such an encompassing feeling of dread, and I really liked the main character's descent into batshit bird person. Also liked how it didn't anthropomorphize - the message stayed clear: don't fuck with wild nature animals. The writing was really beautiful too.

*Beautiful Darkness* (comic) - you can read this in an hour, and it'll be the best hour you've ever spent. This comic is truly beautiful and dark; the contrast is palpable, the way the art and story plays out is genius. There are some truly **What The Fuck** moments in this that slip into you like an impossibly sharp knife. 

*In the House in the Dark of the Woods* \- aka, *Why Does No One I Recommend This Book To Like It As Much As Me?* This is one of the only books I've read where I re-read it immediately upon completion. It's subtle and difficult to really grasp exactly what is happening, but it's so beautifully written, the themes beautifully played out, and the horror terrifying. I don't think this book is for ~~everyone~~ most people, but something about it clicked for me perfectly.

*The Scar* (Mieville) - Not primarily horror, but if you've read Mieville before, you know this man does everything - horror, sci-fi, fantasy, politics, lovecraftian monsters... This book is just epic, and like *Perdido Street Station* it's a masterclass of imagination mixed with wonderful writing.

**All-time favorite re-reads**

*Annihilation* \- think this is my fourth time reading this book? It's beautiful, and I love the biologist as a character. Not much needs to be said about this book, it's pretty iconic. 

*Negative Space* \- I love this book. Seems to be growing in popularity in this sub, so I won't say much, but if you like new wave horror with young adult characters that truly feel like fucked up young adults, this book is for you. If you don't like gross, depressing, miserable settings, give it a pass. Funnily enough, when I first read this book, I almost DNF'd it. But I finished it, and I liked it; and though I didn't *really* like it, something about it really stayed with me - stayed with me enough to make me want to re-read it less than a year later. After rereading this book two more times, it's now probably my favorite book ever.

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand that's my list :)",horrorlit

You can't just browse through a Horror category on Amazon like you can with thrillers or romance. If you don't have a specific author or title it is hard to see what's new or interesting (thank you, r/horrorlit).

1667933871.0,Gillian Flynn,"A few months ago, after rewatching *Gone Girl*, I decided to read the book, and then I read *Sharp Objects* and then *Dark Places* all within the space of about a week. She's definitely become one of my favorite contemporary writers. 

I think she comes remarkably close to horror without being a ""horror writer."" The horror vibes aren't so prominent in *Gone Girl* but very much so in *Sharp Objects* and especially *Dark Places*. Her writing has a sense of eerieness and ""ickiness"" that's difficult for me to describe but very much present throughout the books. Just this deep, uncomfortable feeling that something horrible is about to happen.  *Sharp Objects* and *Dark Places* in particularly have some grisly stuff in them. She also does a great job sketching out drab, exhausted little American towns with the life half sucked out of them, a setting I always greatly enjoy. 

If you're a horror fan I would definitely recommend reading her stuff even if it isn't 'technically' horror. 

I would love for Flynn to write a ""straight"" horror novel someday. I think it would be fantastic.",horrorlit
1663594521.0,Winterset Hollow is a brilliantly written horror novel,"“Winterset Hollow” by Jonathan Edward Durham truly sets the bar high for a brilliantly written horror novel that has so many layers of great storytelling that it took me on an incredible ride from beginning to end. To be fair, this is definitely a slow-burn kind of novel at first but once you get past the building up of this incredible story, it’s beyond worth it and so intense because it’s pretty insane that something like this could ever happen.

From the characters, food, story, lore, twists, blood, and sheer carnage, I did not expect all this to transpire in this novel. I was pleasantly surprised at how much of a great read this was as it’s a genuine page-turner that has thrills, terror, and some very bone-chilling moments that I’ll never forget. Very creepy moments that make you shudder and wince because the way it’s described just sends a chill down your spine.

I love how it takes some classic childhood characters that we all read while growing up and adds a horrific twist to it that makes it feel so palpable. Everything happens for a reason as this is such an intelligently written novel I would highly recommend it to anyone that loves horror with a dark fantasy twist. Once it was over, the ending was very satisfying as I didn’t see it coming at all. Again, just an excellent way to wrap things up and make this a memorable read.

“Winterset Hollow” by Jonathan Edward Durham easily gets a 5/5 and considering this is his debut novel, I am following him from here on out. He’s such a terrific author that I am very much looking forward to reading his future content whenever it gets published. This was a powerhouse of a read and let’s just say, I will never look at foxes the same ever again.",horrorlit

I have actually scrolled through a few of these threads and put a bunch of those books on my reading list, including the books that do feature rapes (listening to cockblock by cv hunt on audible now and have haters trilogy queued up).

&#x200B;

For me things like the crossed comics are terrifying and i can read/listen to them (huge crossed fan actually), BUT im also a victim of rape and sometimes those books put me in a bad headspace. Honesly it all depends on mood. So id like some horror suggestions where rape and child abuse arent even mentioned. Gimme some good ole fashioned ghouls and goblins stories, or deranged serial killers, or zombpoc where the survivors arent raping each other (i love the undead series by rr haywood, but man theres a lotta rapey shit in there, makes it super uncomfortable sometimes)",horrorlit

My perception was always that MD was an adventure novel, one with crazy proto-postmodern (I guess that can be a thing) structure and beautiful language and wild characters, sure. But always adventure, never horror. It's marketed that way, and, based on my conversations with people who've read it for class, that's how it's taught.

Sure, it's an adventure novel, maybe even an adventure novel first and foremost, but it's batshit crazy and full of grotesque imagery and people going insane due to the incomprehensibility of the cosmos and there are literal, real-life leviathans and men with hellish pacts!

1607472687.0,"The ""cosmic horror cozy""","I have been experiencing a feeling recently. I don't know if this is just me, or if others can connect to it as well. Out of all the sub-genres in horror, I feel a certain warmth when I read a cosmic horror story.  Every time I come across a short fiction that has a cosmic theme, or one of Lovecraft's own, I immediately start to feel cozy and comfortable. Some things that produce this sensation are:

1. The guarantee that there will never be extremely graphic, gory imagery in the story.
2. The plot will contain unexplored/unexplained phenomena that will be never be fully investigated by the protagonist/characters.
3. Most stories might have New England roots, old rituals, antique objects, huge tomes with alien languages, pagan and occult elements.
4. Lacuna or intervals in the story left to the reader's interpretation.

These characteristics seem to simulate a peculiar joy or what I call ""warmth"" when reading the story. I have observed that I don't rush to finish the story or to know what's gonna happen in the end or even what the suspense element is going to be. I keep relishing as I read the story.

I observed this feeling when I first read Dunwich Horror by Lovecraft. Then, when I read The Willows by Algernon Blackwood; The Ash Tree by M.R. James; Dream of a Manikin and The Last Feast of Harlequin by T. Ligotti; Pickman's Model, Alchemist, Facts Concerning The Late Arthur Jermyn and his Family by H.P. Lovecraft; Proboscis by Laird Barron; One For the Road and Jerusalem's Lot by Stephen King.

The book follows a kid named Russ, growing up deep in Mormon country.

What I really enjoyed about it was how you got to follow Father Karras as he slowly comes to accept that it may be a possession.

[The Return by Rachel Harrison](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49878129) 3/5 - A friend goes missing, is presumed dead, but then returns with no memory. Fun story, and the author did a really good job with making all the characters feel life-like. I know people like the main characters and I would never want to hang out with them lol.  
[Teratologist by Edward Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/485684) 3/5 - Top 3 most fucked up book I've read. If you want splatterpunk, look no further.  
[The Loch by Steve Alten](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105742) 4/5 - A great monster thriller, easy ""popcorn"" read.  
[Meddling Kids by Edgar Cantero](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32905343) 4/5 - Scooby doo meets Lovecraft! Had a fun time reading it throughout.  
[The Good House by Tananarive Due](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41539) 4/5 - Love this author so much. Fairly long but because of the pacing and storytelling, it doesn't feel it. Don't be fooled by the name, this is less of a haunted house story and more of a voodoo story.  
[The Big Meat by Carlton Mellick III](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53625392) 4/5 - A giant kaiju dies after terrorizing America and now we follow the crew that goes inside the dead body to haul off the meat and clean the city. Amazing premise, amazing execution, and holy shit what an ending.  
[The Haunted by Bentley Little](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11797285) 4/5 - One of the better haunted house/ghost stories I've read. It had some genuinely creepy moments throughout.  
[Maynard's House by Herman Raucher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242692) **5/5** - Gothic horror with themes of trauma and paranoia and isolation. Went into this completely blind and it honestly blew me away.

1642779967.0,"I just recently read The Girl Next Door by Jack Ketchum and just wanted to say something real quick. No actual spoilers, but not sure if anyone wants to discuss it.","So, I wanted a book that would make me actually uncomfortable for once, and I sure got what I asked for. I read it in just under 2 days because it was so disturbing to me that I a) needed to know how it ended and, b) needed to get it over with. I don’t think I’ll ever read it again, either. I really need to start reading the summary of books before I start them.

The other night, my bf and I were looking for something to watch on Netflix and I came across the movie. I didn’t even understand how they’d be able to make that book into a movie. I told my bf, “this is the book I read the other day. The one that fucked me up.” He said, “put it on.” I tried telling him, “you don’t understand, it was such a messed up book.” He insisted, though. He’s not a reader, he hates reading, he doesn’t understand how I can read for hours and read one book after another. We watched the movie in silence, and at the end he just said, “what the fuck??” And I said, “I told you. The book was way worse.”

**[Dark Mountain by Richard Laymon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1122006)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* A witch and her psycho son fucks with 2 families.
* *Sub-genre:* Thriller, splatterpunk
* *Bechdel Test:* Pass
* *Trigger Warnings:* >!Sexual assault!<
* *Rating:* 1/5
* *Review:* This is my first 1 star rating in over 850 books and I'm so upset I broke my streak. I should have DNFed this book. If you took out all the unnecessary and irrelevant sex scenes, there's a barely OK and somewhat creepy story here. The irredeemable part: after one of the MCs is sexually assaulted the first thing she wants to do is to have sex with her crush and the only thing she's worried about is that he might think she's ""dirty."" What in the goddamn fuck.


**[Waiting by Frank M. Robinson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/430151)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* Humans but not humans want their world back.
* *Sub-genre:* Science Fiction
* *Bechdel Test:* Fail
* *Trigger Warnings:* None
* *Rating:* 2/5
* *Review:* Premise is absolutely fantastic; this is a plot I've been wanting to read for so long. Unfortunately, all the parts between the ""action"" was a bit boring and overall it kind of fell flat for me.


**[All the White Spaces by Ally Wilkes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58438634)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* Polar expedition gone wrong.
* *Sub-genre:* Historical Fiction, arctic
* *Bechdel Test:* Fail
* *Trigger Warnings:* none
* *Rating:* 2/5
* *Review:* Despite being in one of the most dangerous places on Earth, the characters getting picked off one by one, and some evil entity lurking about, the stakes never actually felt high. Just a bit of a slog and could have done with some editing to tighten it up. One good thing was that there was trans representation which is great, but wish the book was better. One day I'll find an arctic expedition book I actually like...


**[The Influence by Ramsey Campbell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218633)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* Mean old aunt possesses her young niece after death
* *Sub-genre:* Supernatural
* *Bechdel Test:* Pass
* *Trigger Warnings:* None.
* *Rating:* 3/5
* *Review:* Quintessential 80s horror paperback novel. A bit predictable but enjoyable overall.


**[The Dinosaur Tourist by Caitlín R. Kiernan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39798600)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* Weird short story collection.
* *Sub-genre:* Short Stories 
* *Bechdel Test:* Pass
* *Trigger Warnings:* >!Animal abuse!<
* *Rating:* 3/5
* *Review:* Kiernan says she has no interest in plot and is much more interested in atmosphere, language, mood, etc. It definitely shows in this short story collection; she is an incredibly talented writer and I enjoyed her work. I do like plot and story so this wasn't completely my jam, but despite that I enjoyed this book overall.


**[The Fervor by Alma Katsu](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58652649)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* Mysterious disease spreads in internment camps during WWII.
* *Sub-genre:* Historical Fiction
* *Bechdel Test:* Pass
* *Trigger Warnings:* >!Miscarriage, multiple sex scenes!<
* *Rating:* 3/5
* *Review:* I enjoyed the mesh of WWII historical fiction and Japanese yokai, and I think it tells a really important story that's relevant today. A big reason I read horror is for escapism and this book was more of a continuation of the ugly side of today's society. Especially a hard read for an Asian-American reader.


**[Her Body and Other Parties by Carmen Maria Marchado](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33375622)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* Surreal and genre-bending short stories about what it is to be a woman.
* *Sub-genre:* Short stories
* *Bechdel Test:* Pass
* *Trigger Warnings:* >!A ton of sex, consensual and otherwise, animal death/abuse!<
* *Rating:* 4/5
* *Review:* The entire book was cerebral and thought provoking and weird. Especially Heinous just blew me away with its weirdness and twist on the Law and Order SVU show.


**[Cunning Folk by Adam Nevill](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58851564)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* These neighbors are weird af.
* *Sub-genre:* Paranormal
* *Bechdel Test:* Pass
* *Trigger Warnings:* >!Suicide, dog death, child injury!<
* *Rating:* 4/5
* *Review:* Great read! While this premise is kind of done to death, I really enjoy Nevill's writing style and imagery in this book.


**[Broken Monsters by Lauren Beukes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23341578)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* A serial killer is killing people and fusing them with animals. POV from the detective, her daughter, journalists, and more.
* *Sub-genre:* Mystery, thriller
* *Bechdel Test:* Pass
* *Trigger Warnings:* >!Sexual assault, child death, animal death!<
* *Rating:* 4/5
* *Review:* Starts out as a typical dark mystery/thriller and slowly gets more fantastical and downright bizarre. Great character work!


**[Cell by Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10567)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* Cell phones caused the apocalypse.
* *Sub-genre:* Zombies (kinda)
* *Bechdel Test:* Fail
* *Trigger Warnings:* >!Suicide, Animal Abuse!<
* *Rating:* 4/5
* *Review:* I really liked it! I think I might be an unpopular opinion because it seems a lot of the reviews aren't so good for this book but it was great. An interesting twist on the typical zombie or apocalyptic novel and I loved that they didn't pull back for the protagonists. This is the end of the world and everything sucks; it makes sense when horrible things happen and people don't get a happy ending.


**[House Next Door by Anne Rivers Siddon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104217)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* It's a haunted house book, yo.
* *Sub-genre:* Mystery
* *Bechdel Test:* Pass
* *Trigger Warnings:* >!Miscarriage, animal death!<
* *Rating:* 4/5
* *Review:* I love the author's writing style. It was simultaneously cozy and creepy.


**[All's Well by Mona Awad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53256108)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* Theater professor gets mystery healing potion while producing a play.
* *Sub-genre:* Thriller, weird lit, fantasy-ish
* *Bechdel Test:* Pass
* *Trigger Warnings:* >!Chronic pain!<
* *Rating:* 4/5
* *Review:* Tows the line beautifully between unbelievably realistic to wonderfully fantastic with a slow progression from one to the other. Also, the author's portrayal of a woman in chronic pain that no one believes was uncomfortably accurate. I would recommend at least a quick wikipedia summary of Shakespeare's play before reading this book!


**[The Hungry Moon by Ramsey Campbell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218637)**

* *Oversimplified plot:* Outsiders come into a small town and awaken something evil.
* *Sub-genre:* Fantasy
* *Bechdel Test:* Pass
* *Trigger Warnings:* >!Animal abuse (dogs and a lizard), consensual sex!<
* *Rating:* 5/5
* *Review:* Absolutely loved this book. There's a steady rise in tension, no meandering of any kind, and a very rewarding ending. Incredibly fun and completely satisfying.

**Horror adjacent mentions**

[The Hearing Trumpet by Leonora Carrington](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46987) is an incredible, surreal, genre-bending book unlike anything I've ever read before. It all starts when a 92-year-old woman is gifted a hearing trumpet and overhears her family deciding to send her off to a home for elderly. It's hard to describe but easy to love and there are a handful of downright creepy moments in here. Easily a 5/5; highly, highly recommend this one.

[The Blind Owl by Sadegh Hedayat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45967) is a classic Iranian novella that is dark, gripping, and also a touch surreal. After a man loses his love, we see his descent and it's quite the ride. 4/5 and also recommend this one. TW: >!suicide!<

If a cover looks like someone took a one-hour photoshop course before creating their cover, I'll skip spending a precious credit or buying the kindle version for the reduced Audible price. Or, flowery lettering with a shirtless guy? No. I have almost 1300 Audible books, have been a member for 20 years, and it used to seem a little less filled with dreck. Or, I could just be in a bad mood today.

I know it's a problem, and I'm probably missing some hidden gems. It isn't fair because there are plenty of professionally published books with great covers that were laughably bad, like Dead Silence and The Last Astronaut.

Things I love in Horror Movies:

- Cosmic Horror (for example Annihilaton, 2001 a space odyssey, anything Lovecraft related ..)
- weird things with no clear explanation (I don’t need to know where a monster came from it’s more interesting to me if things are left up to interpretation)
- Cults,Covens, obscure Religions (f.e. The Ritual, Midsommar, Suspiria Remake…)
- I also have a soft spot for witches so anything Witch related would be awesome as well
- I also really like the „final girl“ trope 
- history and sci-fi 

Things I don’t like in horror:

- graphic descriptions of sexual assult (it’s ok if it’s mentioned but I hate graphic descriptions of rape)
- violence with no point to it (slasher or gore movies)
- serial killers
- demons/possessions

Also I know about Stephen King and H.P. Lovecraft so I don’t need any recs from their books

1623444973.0,Don’t sleep on Hyperion as a horror novel.,"Dan Simmons’ *The Terror* is a pretty well beloved book on this subreddit, so I would assume most of you are familiar with the author. His other major work, Hyperion, is a sci-fi novel with horror elements. 

First off, holy *hell* is this book good so far. I’m about a quarter through. It has an interesting type of structure with various characters telling stories as the overall plot progresses, I believe supposed to be a nod to The Canterbury Tales, due to the naming convention. (*The Priest’s Tale, The Soldier’s Tale, The Poet’s Tale*, etc.)

Not all of these stories are horror, but >!The Priest’s Tale!< was one of the most horrifying stories I have heard in quite a while. 

While other’s seem to have more of an action, or humor focus, there is a significant amount of “What the *fuck*” moments. 

Aside from the very well written horror, *wow* can Simmon’s write an action scene. In *The Terror* >!Blankey’s narrow escape from the Tuunbaq!< is a great showing of this, but Hyperion is next level, and the author pulls *no punches* when it comes to gore.

—The Vine That Ate the South by JD Wilkes

—Some stuff by Cormac McCarthy (maybe not pure horror but similar)

—Old Gods of Appalachia (podcast, but I figure it’ll get recommended if I don’t mention it)

And that’s the only reason I pushed through it. The methodically detailed and graphically violent depictions of animal abuse and killings were just too much. I mean, it was really too much.  

This is the first novel that I’ve ever had to skip over practically a whole chapter. When the kitten thing started? That’s gonna be a pass for me. I wish that I would’ve zoomed past the turtle scene, too. 

People like different things, and I’m no way passing judgment on anyone who enjoys that kind of thing. To each their own. We all have different life experiences, and those experiences influence our personal limits. 

I cut my teeth on horror. Movies, novels, the works. I’ve got a high tolerance for violence and disturbing material, but this went into glorification territory for me. 

I just felt . . . bad after reading this. I feel like I did something wrong. I don’t like that feeling. I hope that makes sense.  

I’m not much for trigger warnings—we’re all adults here—but I think people need to know what they’re getting into when it’s this extreme. To anyone who’s thinking about reading The Troop but can’t handle this sort of material, consider this a head’s up. 

EDIT or FOLLOW-UP or whatever:

Thank you all for reading. I’ve enjoyed all of the replies, both pro and con. Lots of different ideas and that’s great. I’ll admit that at a different time in my life this sort of thing wouldn’t bother me as much. Actually, I was very surprised that it did. 

Then I thought about where I’m at right now, my recent experiences and trials of life, and I was like, “Oh. Ok. I get it now. Duh.” Different seasons bring different tastes and different challenges. The Troop succeeded in its goal in that regard. It made me think. 

That all came to me while reading these comments, so, again, I appreciate all of the responses. And I would never want to turn anyone away from a story, so it’s great that some of the comments cooled down my hot take. That gives potential readers a more balanced set of opinions to make their own choices. And that’s always a good thing.

What else have I been missing?,"My background is that frankly I’ve barely touched a book since high school. I’m trying to learn to focus more and be more present and I’ve decided to try to return to reading because it’s something I once enjoyed.

Before this point the only horror literature I’d ever read is a little bit of Poe and nearly all of H P Lovecraft’s short stories. I adored them. His specific brand of horror, the first person perspective, a sort of world building that made our real world feel like maybe there was a little mystery still left in it. 

Fast forward to about a month ago. I decide that along side my horror movie rituals this spooky season, I’m going to read all of Dracula by October 31st. So far I’ve been blown away. Obviously this is considered a classic so maybe I should have known, but this book has shocked me and given me back my love of literature. And I’m so many ways it also represents the things I enjoyed from Lovecraft - 1st person, realistic enough that you could imagine it being real, etc.

Even though horror by definition deals with negative feelings and heavy topics far too many authors forget that we need moments of humor, kindness, silliness, and joy. Both because it does important humanization to and adds depth for characters it also adds an extra layer of emotional weight when terror does strike .Of course this isn't to completely disregard the artistic merit of doing away with a solace of joy or that every premise has room for it but its something that is overall neglected in the genre.

1679759017.0,Just Finished A Head Full of Ghosts and oh boy...,"This is my new favorite book. I love everything about it - how it was written, the pacing, the protag and pov, the characters, and the way the story progressed. 

I love how the ending and the progression of the story leaves me wondering and guessing about what really happened. Who really poisoned who? Who was *really* sick and needed help? Why did things turn out the way they did? I just love all of it. 

I also love how there are some things implied and kind of mentioned but not really out-right labeled. For example, in the beginning of the book I thought adult Merry was a normal, particular person. And at first you think she was the only normal person to come out of her abnormal situation. But this isn't the case. Although adult Merry seems independent, successful, and ""normal,"" she's not. She's clearly living with her traumas and impactful experiences as a kid, and by the end of the book we, the reader, realize that she's not normal. No where in the book does it say Merry is traumatized, lives with PTSD, or takes meds to help her. But I think this is left open on purpose, and it's very well written. 

This is just one of the many aspects of the book that I love. But there was one part I keep thinking  about. At the end, when Marjorie decides to enact her poison plan with Merry's help, she comes from upstairs and joins everyone at the dinner table. When she does, Merry comments about how Marjorie looks like she was crying just moments ago. Why would Marjorie be crying right before poisoning her family?

Because she truly loves her family and thinks this is the only way to save them, but ultimately save Merry? Maybe she feels guilty about doing this? Or maybe she's crying because she's about to die, and won't see her monkey anymore? Maybe she's crying because the happiness and normalcy she was trying to achieve through all this was never going to happen?

Edit: I forgot to mention - this is the first horror book that has actually creeped me out!!! I've never been creeped out from reading horror until now, and I'm so happy I found a book that made me feel genuinely spooked!!!",horrorlit

1675096025.0,"I finished 7 books in January and DNF'ed 1, Here's my spoiler free bite size reviews!","**""What Moves The Dead"" - T. Kingfisher: 8/10**

\- Loved this one! Disclaimer: I haven't read the story it's based off of. Kingfisher does such a great job of establishing unease and dread quickly. I wasn't able to guess where this one was going and found each character well developed and unique.  I found this premise really cool and enjoyed the fact that it didn't get too ""in the weeds"" about overexplaining things.  Read this in one setting and now I've picked up 2 of her other books to read her original work.

&#x200B;

**""This Thing Between Us"" - Gus Moreno: 9/10**

\- This one was an absolute blast. A gut wrenching, emotional blast.  I can understand the criticisms of it feeling ""a little too scattered"" but I enjoyed that aspect.  This is a novel about grief wrapped in a horror blanket.  The way Moreno describes stuff is concise and really creepy.  This book is really fast paced and I found my heart aching going through these events with the protagonist. This book also feels somewhat poetic as the main character works through his shit.  I'd love more from Gus

&#x200B;

**""Hidden Pictures"" - Jason Rekulak: 8.5/10**

\- Nothing about this book was what I expected. I found the main character really likeable and enjoyed how she was written. She felt very real and the sympathetic frustration when nobody believes her was at an all time high.  The premise of ""little kid draws fucked up pictures"" seemed a little played out but I feel like this one avoided being a cliche very well.  While less ""jumpscary"" than This Thing Between Us this book had a high sense of just uncomfortablility (sp??? lol) If I had to compare this one to a movie (bear with me) I'd equate it to ""Barbarian"" only in the sense that you have no idea what you're in for. Read it!

&#x200B;

**""Just Like Home"" - Sarah Gailey: 9.5/10**

\- HOLY FUCK. Favorite book of the bunch.  I can't remember the last time that a book made me a little nervous to go to sleep.  A haunted house story about Grief and love.  This book was incredible and I have a hard time writing about it without spoilers.  The characters are entrancing and despicable and the whole story was so well paced and I found myself staying up way too late reading this one.  Gailey writes in a way that puts you off the entire time.  This kind of feels like Stephen King in the sense that ""sometimes the monsters are just people"" and I love that.  I know this review is probably not very helpful.  If you read nothing off this list pick this one!

&#x200B;

**""Negative Space"" - B.R. Yeager: ???/10**

\- I honestly have no idea how I feel about this book other than I know I lean more towards liking it than disliking it.  I don't know who to recommend this to.  I'd describe this book as a very bleak slice of life surrounding some teenagers in a small quiet shitty town.  This book doesn't have a typical plot structure because everything is just contained to the main characters lives.  This book has an odd tone in that everything feels like it has a bummer sort of apathy on top of it.  I think I enjoyed it but I won't be reading it again.

&#x200B;

**""Comemadre"" - Roque Larraquy: 8/10**

\- A super quick one session read that I really enjoyed...for the most part.  If you like Chuck Palahniuk you'll enjoy this.  It's kind of a mocking of ""art snobbery"" in my own opinion. The first half was so fascinating and I think my big criticism is that I wanted more.  I also wish the second half was a little bit more connected but in a book this short I can forgive it.  If the synopsis intrigues you give it a shot.  This book was super unique and one that I actually heard about through Tik Tok. Dammit hahah.

&#x200B;

**""You Should Have Left"" - Daniel Kehlman: 7/10**

\- Less horror more like Inception.  Very uneasy and ""mindfucky"" Read this one in a single session which I think actually helped make this book accomplish what it was trying to do.  I felt like I was unraveling along with the main character as well.  I'd call this ""horror"" kind of along the same way as ""Dark Matter"" by Blake Crouch more psychological than anything but I had a good time. I'm glad this book wasn't longer because I don't see this being a concept holding up in a 3-400 page format.  Short, Punchy, Unique.  Fun ride.

&#x200B;

**""Nothing But Blackened Teeth"" - DNF**

\- Awful.  The prose was so jarring and I got tired of googling things almost instantly.  Felt like the author was trying to prove how much Japanese terminology they could sprinkle in with $20 college words.  Every character felt so abrasive and I didn't care about any of them.  I'll admit I DNFED really quick because I knew it wasn't for me so YMMV but there wasn't anything redeeming enough to keep me in it.",horrorlit

Ive read a few fucked up books varying in different degrees but most read like they were written by people who just wanted to write fucked up stuff for the sake of it (Hogg & COWS). And ive read a few this year that were utterly bleak but beautifully written which turned out to be some of my favorites (BTF & Swan Song). That being said, I needed something new, something fresh to me, a new author to get into. So i decided on Dead Sea. I wasnt expecting much going in and the prologue didnt really grab my attention as i thought it was yet another boring ghost story about ghost ships, but i was wrong....very wrong. The things that happen in this book are pure terror. Its relentless hopelessness with twists and turns i did not expect.

I've read and highly enjoyed:

*The Ritual*

*The Troop*

*The Deep*

*Clown In A Cornfield*

*Don't Move*

*The Night Will Find Us*

I've got *The Terror* on my reading list, and *The Long Walk* sounds like it would qualify as well. *Parasite* sounds right up my alley, but I've heard very mixed reviews about it. *Stranded* sounds very similar to *The Terror* except it takes place in modern day. 

Monsters, aliens, demons, giant insects, killer animals etc are HIGHLY preferred over serial killers/human antagonists. Human antagonists don't interest me unless they're done exceptionally well (*Misery*, for example) or if they're a Michael Myers type/purposely cheesy (hence why I loved *Clown In A Cornfield.* How can I say no to a clown with a chainsaw?) You can still recommend psycho/serial killer stuff, it's just not my preference.

I have Neil Gaimen's Neverwhere, which seems like it might scratch the itch. Not sure how much of a horror book it is though. I want to be spooked!

Any help is appreciated! Thanks!",horrorlit

1584668956.0,In my 30's and embarrassingly just read my first Stephen King novel. Now the love I had for horror books as a kid is resurfacing. Give me all of your chilling lists.,"Since it's the quarantine I figured this was a good time as any to finally get into King. I've always wanted to but didn't know where to start. I've seen movies of his books adapted such as The Shining but his ouvre was so vast it was beyond intimidating. 

So I bought a bunch of books the other day to ride this out. Carrie. Salem's Lot. The Shining. The Stand. Some non horror King. 

I finished Carrie yesterday. I read nearly all 300 pages in two sittings. I loved it as King described my favorite type of horror: the horror of mankind. 

Growing up I loved horror. I was entranced by the macabre and cool covers of Goosebumps. I relished Animorph's (if it counts). Growing older I fell in love with Poe, Stoker. I have a love for horror, especially film, but so much of my exposure to the genre these days is typically low hanging fruit. Horror film now relies on jump scares and the stories that truly try to draw a picture of true scares of mankind and our complicated suffering are rare. 

These days I tend to read non-fiction as a rule. 

But something about Carrie reignited the thrill I had reading Telltale Heart. After finishing the book I had nightmares and images of people I've hurt clawing in my mind. ""Have I unknowingly created a 'Carrie' myself by being cruel to others?"" It made me question, like all the best horror stories do, about my reality and my actions and my truth. I wanted more immediately. 

Tldr: **I want to pursue this genre in full. I'd love your lists, your recs. I'd love at least 100 great horror books to read. I've not had the urge to explore the genre since reading Let The Right One In and Battle Royale over 10 years ago.**

Sorry for the length.",horrorlit

1621534781.0,Cosmic/folk horror recommendations,"Like the title says, I'm looking for cosmic horror/folk horror crossovers ... books about people wandering into strange little villages where nothing is as it seems on the surface, and gradually they get sucked in/trapped/murdered/horribly changed by some cosmic evil/ghost/ancient power/deity.

Basically I want books that are:

\- Terrifying- But not gory, gross, sadistic, or graphically sexual- Kind of Lovecraftian- But not racist/sexist & ideally with characters who aren't all white guys

Some of the books I've enjoyed lately: T Kingfisher's Hollow Places and The Twisted Ones, Rivers Solomon's An Unkindness of Ghosts, Caitlin Kiernan's The Red Tree, Victor LaValle's The Changeling, Cherie Priest's The Toll, Jeff Vandermeer's Southern Reach Trilogy.

Any suggestions are welcome ... they don't have to be specifically cosmic horror or folk horror or both, as long as they have a good scary atmosphere and are well written.

The book, legit, needs editing, but it's a fun, ***WEIRD***, ride.  Clearly, King had not achieved sobriety yet (?) at this point (?).

1626118404.0,𝔗𝔥𝔦𝔯𝔱𝔢𝔢𝔫 𝔇𝔢𝔣𝔦𝔫𝔦𝔱𝔦𝔳𝔢 𝔚𝔬𝔯𝔨𝔰 𝔬𝔣 𝕲𝖔𝖙𝖍𝖎𝖈 𝕳𝖔𝖗𝖗𝖔𝖗,"Hi folks!

As Halloween approaches, I'm trying to put together a reading list of genre-defining Gothic horror books, and I would love to have your input.

My goal is to capture the thirteen (since this is Gothic horror, after all) most renowned, influential, and spine-tingling works in the genre, preferably from between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries. Basically, I want a collection that could give today's reader a comprehensive overview of Gothic literature and a Victorian reader the heebie-jeebies, capable of being comfortably stored in an a creaky old chest in the attic for decades to come.

Here's my current selection, which I've cobbled together from several online lists, reddit posts, and Wikipedia articles:

I. *The Castle of Otranto* (1764)

II. *Vathek* (1786)

III. *The Mysteries of Uldolpho* (1794)

IV. *The Monk* (1796)

V. *Frankenstein* (1818)

VI. *Melmoth the Wanderer* (1820)

VII. The Collected Short Stories of Edgar Allen Poe (esp. *The Fall of the House of Usher*, 1839)

VIII. *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* (1886)

IX. *The Picture of Dorian Gray* (1891)\*\*

X. *Dracula* (1897)

XI. *The Turn of the Screw* (1898)

XII. *The Werewolf of Paris* (1933)\*

XIII. *The Haunting of Hill House* (1959)

As you might notice, there are some conspicuous absences and additions to this list, which I would like to take some time to explain.

I've left out *Jane Eyre* and *Wurthering Heights*, which, while certainly Gothic masterpieces, don't particularly resonate in my mind as Gothic *horror* novels.

As for additions, there is the obvious outlier, *The Haunting of Hill House*. I've included this because, despite the fact it is the only book on the list written in the 20th century, and well into it for that matter, it is not only considered a quintessential Gothic horror, but furthermore it routinely makes the top 3 of the greatest horror novels of all time, regardless of genre. Thus, it can serve as a great (and literal) bookend to the collection.

Please feel free to critique!

*(P.S. if you folks can figure out whether The Werewolf of Paris fits in here, and if so, how I could squeeze it in, let me know! I'm trying to jam in as many classic horror trope-setting books as possible.)*

EDIT:

Thank you so much for the feedback! 

\* I've decided to remove *The Vampyre*, since vampire fiction is already so robustly represented with *Dracula*. I've decided to replace it with either *The Werewolf of Paris* (or *Wagner, the Wehr-wolf,* if that would be a better fit?), so that werewolves can get some representation (I really can't imagine a Gothic horror collection without them).

\*\* I've also received a comment recommending I remove *Dorian Gray*. What do you folks think? It is a well known and oft-recommended classic (at least on online lists) and does offer some rare LGBT representation, but I'm open to replacing it with *Rebecca*, *Carmilla*, or *The Invisible Man* if I can be convinced these are more quintessentially Gothic horror.",horrorlit
1616625701.0,Nathan Ballingrud's The Butcher's Table is one of the best things I've read in a longtime.,"Man, am I ever in the mood to both swashbuckle and participate in some occult rites. I didn't adore all of Wounds, the short-story collection this comes from. Some really great ideas, some fantastic imagery, but most left me wanting a lot more. I will say I am one of the rare folks who really enjoyed Skullpocket. A little childish in parts, but equal parts horrifying with some incredible world-building. 

But The Butcher's Table... [Gentlemanly Satanic societies! Pirates! Fantastically described ritual magic! A Satanic order of monks mapping Hell! And description of the literal borderlands of Hell! With regard to the latter, I was certain that I would be let down once the place was actually described. I was not.. And all that beside, wonderful characters with interesting motivations!](/spoiler)

Other than praising this book, I suppose my questions are 1.) what were your thoughts and 2.) is there anything anywhere that is even remotely similar? 

Reminded me a lot of Barker. Always my favorite author. And I was not surprised to read Ballingrud's thoughts on him:

> When I encountered The Books of Blood and The Damnation Game years ago, I felt like I was reading something holy. It’s part of my DNA now. And of course it would be ridiculous not to acknowledge the influence of “The Hellbound Heart” on my own dream of Hell. Clive Barker feels like a spiritual father to me

I read it in 2 days and now feel like I've lost a good friend. The story immersed me so well into Hill House and I miss the characters and it makes me sad that the story is over. Does anyone else know of any books similar to this one? I really enjoyed how you couldnt tell if it was paranormal activity or if Eleanor was loosing her mind, she seemed a bit unhinged. Are Shirley Jacksons other works worth visiting, and if so are they horror or not to the extent of The Haunting of Hill House. Anyways I look forward to hearing about your opinions!",horrorlit

The whole wide world of mythological horror and creature features is open to us. I’d be interested in something different than zombies, vampires, werewolves, and possessions.

1674183333.0,"~ I HAVE NO EYES, AND I MUST READ ~ jk I’m just having eye surgery. Audiobook recs, please!","
Like the title says (all due apologies to Mr. Ellison). I’m having eye surgery and won’t be able to read-read for a few days. So while I’m rendered blind and helpless and vulnerable, please recommend something that will scare the mortal crap outta me.

(Or at least drown out the sounds of my upstairs neighbors banging to godawful late-90s nü-metal. My mind is breaking. I can hear them pooping when they’re in the bathroom, too. God I hate this apartment.)


I’m up for anything, but some authors I really dig include Laird Barron, Adam Neville, Cristopher Buehlman… and of course classic King and Barker and all the usual suspects. Koontz has his moments, too, when he’s not rhapsodizing about golden retrievers and Jesus and shit… I mean *The Taking* and *Intensity* were total bangers, I give him that.

My favorite horror audiobooks are the Barron collections narrated by Ray Porter, Buehlman’s  *The Lesser Dead*, the full cast recording of *Wylding Hall* by Elizabeth Hand… Oh, and Ballingrud’s “The Butcher’s Table” is one of the greatest things I’ve heard/read, ever… anything remotely like that would be awesome (there is a woeful dearth of subterranean satanic cannibal - gay demon pirate crossover fiction in this world, imho). Horror-adjacent dark fantasy/sci-fi/Weird fiction à la China Mieville or VanderMeer’s *Annihilation* is cool, too. 

This sub has never failed me. I trust y’all’s judgement. You’re beautiful and I love you. Thank you all in advance.

1623054892.0,Sharing some love for Brian Lumley,"I've read a *lot* of horror and a lot of different authors. None of them have been so consistently fantastic as Lumley. 

I feel as though he's incredibly overlooked in the genre as a whole though. I virtually never see him talked about and I'd love to change that for some lucky people who may not have heard of him.

He is most famous for his [**Necroscope**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66655.Necroscope) saga. Without a doubt in my mind the greatest vampire fiction in all creation. I couldn't recommend it highly enough, and don't let yourself be dissuaded by the fact that there are 13+ books. The first book is completely standalone so it need not be viewed as a big commitment. Though, after finishing it you'll be happy that there's so much more to come.

He's also got a lot of roots in Cosmic Horror for anyone into that scene. He's got two extended series: [**Titus Crow**](https://www.goodreads.com/series/54906-titus-crow) and [**Dreamlands**](https://www.goodreads.com/series/54911-new-adventures-in-h-p-lovecraft-s-dreamlands) that take place in Lovecraft's own universe with the likes of Cthulhu and other Elder Gods.

His bibliography goes on with some fantastic standalones or 2-3 book series', including: [**Psychomech**](https://www.goodreads.com/series/54910-psychomech), [**House of Doors**](https://www.goodreads.com/series/54914-house-of-doors), [**Khai of Ancient Khem**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1505751.Khai_of_Khem?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=SninDwbxBl&rank=2), among others. 

Plus a wealth of short stories and novellas for the folks into that format.

Yes I'm fanboying, but I really feel like he's the most slept-on author in the entire genre. People should give him a go - you won't regret it!

Ben H. Winters: ""Bedbugs: A Novel of Infestation"" - $1.99
(I don't know of the author, but it looked kind of interesting.)

**Horror Adjacent Monthly Deals**

Allison Littlewood: ""The Hidden People"" - arguably not horror and I didn't like it that much personally, but it deals with fairies and changelings and it's only $.99, so I'll include it. 

Sergei Lukyanenko: The Night Watch collection books 1-3 bundle (""Night Watch"", ""Day Watch"", and ""Twilight Watch"" - $3.99. Maybe not horror, but it's got vampires and shit, so I'll allow it. 

Raymond E. Feist - Legends of Riftwar bundle (Honored Enemy, Murder in LaMut, and Jimmy the Hand) $3.99 - definitely not horror, but I recognize his name as a horror writer so I'm assuming he may be of interest to some of you. 

Sue Burke: ""Semiosis: A Novel"" - $2.99. Definitely sci-fi, but it's got sentient alien plants and it seems pretty popular. Might be cool.

1649250639.0,Does anyone else here NOT get creeped out by Stephen King’s books?,"I love Stephen king. Just gonna throw that out first- the shining, the stand, salems lot and pet sematary are all high on my list of favorites. But IMO he really excels in the psychological terror of other characters and descent into madness- which is scary but not particularly *creepy*. It just fills me with dread which I also love!

There are a few stories like “The Man in the Black Suit” that freak me out and they’re all in his short story collections. But I’m wondering if there’s any other books I should check out by him that have a more terrified to look out my window sort of vibe.

Most of Nevill’s books scared me, Michelle paver, annihilation, etc.

1587427442.0,The State of the Horror Section at Barnes & Noble - An Essay,"Hi r/horrorlit, I’ve been a long time member of this sub but I’ve decided to post with a new account since what I’m going to be talking about relates to my career. I want to make it clear that I am in no way authorized to speak on behalf of Barnes & Noble and all of the following is public, not privileged, information coupled with my own observation

Often on this sub there are threads lamenting the loss of the horror section at bookstores including Barnes and Noble. This post is mostly to address that and provide some indication of what things may look like in the future as well as providing advice on how to procure horror novels from your local Barnes and Noble.

I am a Sales & Inventory Manager for Barnes & Noble. Please pardon me for not revealing where I am located. Like many of you one of my greatest joys early in my life was going to bookstores, straight to the horror aisle, and browsing the numerous horror titles especially with their lurid and provocative covers. Then one day this aisle was gone. At my local, long-ago defunct, bookstore it was replaced by a Thriller section containing the bulk of the Hannibal series and it’s imitators. Eventually the covers grew blander and the authors would become mixed in with general fiction if they were considered “respectable”, more often than not meaning bestselling, this includes King, Koonz, and Rice. Or they were mixed in with Sci-Fi/Fantasy if they were considered “childish/sensational”. Thriller eventually became split between Mystery and Fiction. These divisions continue to this day at Barnes & Noble. Please see Grady Hendrix’s Paperbacks From Hell for a brilliantly concise chronicle of the boom and bust of the horror publishing market.

Horror ceased to be a profitable genre, once the profitability dropped off the marketing of horror as its own distinct genre also dropped off. During this time the only horror market going strong was the young readers market namely that giant: Goosebumps and R.L. Stein. After the 90s came 9/11 and a strong conservative movement that objected to “questionable” media that depicted horror, death, and violence. Think the Clear Channel memorandum. This in addition to publishing squabbles, lead to the gradual end of the young reader horror market and decline of Goosebumps popularity. Now this isn’t the only reason for Goosebumps’ decline, Harry Potter and the YA explosion also took a massive chunk of the market share.

By the time this movement begun to die down the publishing market and bookstores were facing a massive decline with the rise of amazon and digital books. This lead to publishers and bookstores looking for “guaranteed bestsellers” which translated to new books from prolific, established, and bestselling authors as well as books that had the widest audience appeal. This is the same thing the film and cinema industry currently faces. Publishers and booksellers were unwilling to take the risk on new authors or genres with a limited audience. However, amazon and the digital market did open the doors for authors and especially horror authors to self-publish and market their works. Sadly, without a publisher to bankroll behind them, marketing to, reaching, and gaining an audience is an incredibly daunting task and few self-published authors have been able to garden a large enough reader base to interest publishers and booksellers into taking the risk to bring their work to the mainstream. This is the current situation that many in this sub are familiar with.

In August the majority of Barnes & Noble stock was bought by the Elliot Management Corporation. An American investment firm that a year previously acquired a majority stake in the U.K. based bookstore Waterstones. James Daunt the C.E.O. of Waterstones credited with reviving the struggling company, was appointed C.E.O. of Barnes.  From a personal standpoint the changes directed by Daunt have been amazing. Stores are being reinvested in for the first time in over a decade. Much of the corporate BS  is being cut out in favor of a more relaxed and knowledgeable bookstore. New staff and especially upper management are being trained and selected for their knowledge, skills, and love for books. The mandate from the CEO is that in order to remain competitive in an Amazon dominated world: knowledge and specialization is key. There’s going to be greater focus on books themselves rather than sell whatever hire whoever mindset that has dominated the business over the last decade. The stores and their inventory are being completely overhauled. Right now as many of the stores are closed for COVID, the stores not actively shopping online orders are focused on revamping their layouts. There is going to be an increase focus on creating “shops” not “shelves”. Basically instead of having endless rows they will be arranged in three walled block like sections. With this they are focusing on reducing “depth” (number of copies of a single title) and increasing “breath” (number of titles available).

Part of this new focus on book knowledge is empowering staff to curate their own promotional sections. If a bookseller is particularly knowledgeable and interested in poetry for instance then they are encouraged to curate an end cap or table of titles to promote and suggest to guests. While there still are some limits on what can be ordered into the store they are given large authority on ordering in books to fill their promos with the idea that the bookseller will take point on selling these titles. However the titles must be books that Barnes & Noble can obtain which restricts a lot of the independent publishers and smaller publishers which do not meet Barnes & Noble supplier standards. Also all books requested in are subject to approval by the ordering manager but this is usually not a big deal.

In my experience with the several Barnes & Noble stores I have associated with there are usually 3-5 staff members who are horror hounds per store.  With the new emphasis on staff curated tables it is likely the staff member has already made a small table or end cap with their own personal selections. If you are looking for horror titles your best option is to **speak to a staff member.** I cannot emphasize this enough, booksellers are not there to just stock the shelves and ring up your order.  Many are well educated and extremely knowledgeable about books and especially knowledgeable about what is in their store and where.  Since horror currently does not have its own section, has few authors with multiple titles, and is not a high selling genre many horror titles are limited to one copy per store at a time.  With the majority of the books on the shelf facing spine out it is incredibly difficult to find horror books by just scanning the shelves.  The booksellers spend their entire work day among the stacks. While most of the floor booksellers may not be knowledgeable about the genre they usually know a co-worker or two more than willing to take you on a complete guided tour of every horror title in the store. I often describe ourselves as ""slightly evil librarians"", we do many of the same things as your public librarians, with the catch that we're trying to get you to buy the book.  But trust us, we're not paid enough to lie to you to get you to buy something.  Especially staff members with interest in horror, if we're suggesting something to you it is because we genuinely really love it.

There’s a lot currently working in favor of horror sections returning to stores. Horror has again become one of the better selling genres, largely spurred on by the current renaissance Stephen King’s works have found being adapted to film and television as well as the current buzzword “elevated horror” arousing serious critical evaluation of horror films thanks to works such as “Get Out”, “The VVitch”, and “Hereditary”. Blum House has begun publishing titles. Night Vale’s books are doing well and r/HorrorLit's very own u/GradyHendrix just reached the [NYT Hardcover Fiction Best Sellers List](https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/hardcover-fiction/) (number 14 at the time of this posting - congratulations! It is well deserved). This is a big deal as physical hardcover sales still have an incredible weight in the publishing and book selling industry. Grady Hendrix's Paperback’s From Hell has done a lot to drum up interest and re-evaluation of the horror boom of the 70s-80s. With the rise in the popularity of Manga, Junji Ito has broken through to an incredibly ravenous American audience. I have personally sold 30 copies of Uzumaki this year alone before the shutdown. With the looming Toonami anime adaptation of Uzumaki, Ito’s works are poised to explode to an even larger audience. New author’s are appearing on the scene and their books are beginning to get covers that while not as lurid as the paperbacks from hell, clearly help indicate the book is of the horror genre. Such has John Hornor Jacobs' ""A Lush and Seething Hell"" and Scott Carson's ""The Chill"", both of which debuted in hardcover.

These sales have not gone unnoticed. A recent development is Horror now appears as a “buyer’s code”. While this is not a searchable section in our stores or online this indicates that horror is now being purchased directly because it’s horror rather than before when it would just be labeled fiction or sci/fantasy. This buyer’s code is set by publishers when they are putting out catalogs for the company’s buyers to browse. This makes it easy for the company to shop by genres and thus easier to sell and arrange books by genre. While a usually unnoticeable change this is a massive indication that horror is beginning to be watched closely by the company and publishers as a potential avenue for ""the next big thing"".  In my store we have begun to include a distinct section in our hardcover new releases with Mystery and Thriller buying code for books with the horror buying code. Should horror continue its resurgence, which I believe it will, it is highly likely a horror shelf or section will begin appearing in stores.

There are still limits as to what can currently be procured for stores. This is above my pay grade but essentially Barnes & Noble has production and quality standards that must be met before making arrangements to carry books from publishers. This is addition to the need to have a client base to sell the products to. For instance, a personal favorite publisher of mine is [Valancourt Books](http://www.valancourtbooks.com/). They are predominately known for republishing out of print horror, sci/fi, and LBGTQ+ titles including their recent runs of Paperbacks from Hell with their original covers. However, with their limited printing capabilities and their staff of two humans, two cats, and a dog, they don't currently meet the standards Barnes & Noble's requires to carry their books in store.  However, certain Barnes & Noble stores are able to order Valancourt's books as well as many other titles from small customers.  I have advocated often to have Valancourt's included on our shelves but it is unlikely to happen anytime soon.

The last thing I want to talk about is something I have never seen brought up on this thread: the important of the distinction between ""Front List"" and ""Back List"".  The ""Front List"" is newly released titles, and is limited to the very last book a currently active author has published.  Bring Grady Hendrix back up this would be his ""The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires"".  The shelf life of a title on the front list is not set in stone but a book is usually considered to be front list until the author publishes a new book or the sales have dropped off significantly enough to indicate it is no longer generating it's own momentum. The ""Back List"" is literally everything else.  So everything Stephen King has written from ""Elevation"" back is considered his back list while ""The Institute"" is considered front list. There are some exceptions to this and Stephen King is a great example.  ""Doctor Sleep"" and ""The Outsider"" would generally be considered back list but due to their current high profile and increased sales they are considered front list from a selling standpoint.  While the majority of books sold will be back list the majority of books pulling a big payday are going to be front list.  This is just because of the ratios between the books being currently published and all the books that have been published ever.

By the very nature of books, the very vast majority of titles you are going to want to purchase after you learn about them from this subreddit, a blog, or otherwise is going to be back list.  **Most books do not stay in print forever**, this is especially true of genre books or books considered ""popular"" reading rather than permanent cultural mainstays and classics.  Even when Stephen King eventually dies after a while many of his books will likely go out of print.  If one of the most prolific and best selling authors of the past century's books will go out of print you can 1000000000000% guarantee that only book a South African author ever wrote which happened to be about Nazi leprechauns performing exorcisms on buxom teenage blondes is not going to be in print.  Sometimes you get lucky and a book gets a second life such as through the work of Valancourt and Grady Hendrix but the vast majority of all books published do not even see a second printing.

**What can you do?**

Remember, your money speaks louder than you do.  We live in a capitalist world.  The better selling horror is as a genre the more publishers will be interested in publishing horror novels and the more interested booksellers are going to be with selling them.  The more novels that appear, the more sales they make, the more other authors will be willing to write their own horror novels building up that precious Front List.  If there are strong front list sales of a genre, the horror section will return.  If the horror section does return it will be easier to find back list titles.  This does not mean rush to your Barnes & Noble right away and purchase every horror book off the shelf.  There are numerous ways to support the horror genre, you can purchase them through Barnes & Noble or you can purchase them from the publishers.  You can go to an author signing in a bar and buy them directly.  You can purchase the hardcover, the paperback, the digital copy, or the audio book, although this is in order of how publishers and booksellers usually weigh sales. You can start book clubs, you can start blogs, you can post on social media, you can share your collection with family and friends.  Go the film adaptations in cinemas or watch them on Netflix.  From taking selfies to starting a religion, **the secret to supporting or giving life to the things you enjoy is to actively engage with them.** 

Thank you all for reading,

TL;DR:

Horror has been steadily increasing in sales, booksellers and publishers have noticed.  

A recent acquisition of B&N means changes to how stores sell books and a horror section is possible.  

Ask booksellers for help finding horror titles, helping you find books is their primary purpose.

1653331574.0,The Exorcist ending: book vs movie,"I really like both the book and the movie versions of The Exorcist. Overall, I think the movie was very faithful to its source material, and it's probably one of my favourite films. 

However, towards the end of it (spoilers ahead) there's a small detail that has aways bothered me. In the movie, after Father Merrin dies, Father Karras completely loses his temper, jumps over the possessed Regan and beats her until the demon passes to his own body. He then uses his last moments of self-control to sacrifice himself, taking the demon with him.

In the book, however, Father Karras doesn't beat Regan. He actually convinces the demon to possess him by taunting it, by insulting the demon's pride. I think this is more interesting than the movie's version because it both emphasizes Father Karras cleverness as a psychiatrist and contrasts it to the Demon's vanity. Father Karras doesn't indulge in rage and mindless violence against Regan's body (something the demon would likely approve). He actually defeats the demon by cleverly strinking its weak spot: self-confidence, pride (which are also common traits of demons both in litterature and religion). In the end, what we have is the triumph of intelect and self-sacrifice over vanity, in a way that feels very in line with both of the characters.

So, if I could change something in the movie's version, it would probably be this small but, in my opinion, meaningful detail.

Ligotti, Aickman, Lovecraft’s original stories (hardly any good adaptations), Langan, Brite, Barron, and others.

1606570302.0,The Shining is an upsetting book (Spoilers),"Earlier this week we had our first snowfall. So, I decided to reread 'The Shining'. I thought I could use a nice familiar snow-centric horror story to get me back into the reading 'rhythm' seeing as I took a month off. I'll admit it, when I last read it I was pretty depressed so maybe it's tone was lost on me. I'm doing much better now mentally but holy shit is the book ever bleak and nearly upsetting!

I'm still somewhat new to King's works. I've read his first 3 novels and his first short story collection (*'Salem's Lot* was my favourite so far for those curious). To draw some parallels, in Carrie the series of events right before the bloodshed (no pun intended) is the hardest for me to get through. Things are finally going her way and happiness feels just within arms reach before it's ripped away from her. The Shining is that small section stretched out across 600 some odd pages. 

Perhaps this is because I'm rereading it but from nearly the beginning of the book the climactic confrontation of Danny and Jack is foreshadowed. The blue/black jungle rug, the whistling of the roque mallet, the boom of it slamming into the wall. All of it is described in broad strokes early on and is built upon and made clearer with all of Danny's subsequent visions. The way King did this reminded me so much of that famous [interview with Alfred Hitchcock on suspense](https://youtu.be/md6folAgGRU). You KNOW the confrontation is going to happen, regardless of Hallorann's soothing words, but you nearly try and will it so it isn't so. Jack isn't slipping into his old habits, his play is nearly complete! He loves Danny and Wendy, sure he's wiping his mouth again but it has nothing to do with anything, right? Particularly on rereads, you catch all the breadcrumbs King has left throughout the setup and it robs the reader of any joy in the moments where Jack 'truly' loves his family and isn't on the brink of being possessed by the Overlook or possessed by the bottle. 

I don't want anyone to think I dislike the book for these comments. I really am enjoying my time with it, and my love for Hallorann has been rekindled, it's just that this is such a bleak story. Jack is relatable to all the lizard brain impulses that you never act on but feel shameful for even having. The crumbling relationship with his wife is eerily reminiscent to all those early relationships we've all had where we try to make it work regardless of the parade of red flags. 

I actually reread *'Salem's Lot* just before I started up *The Shining* and had none of these emotional hangups. Sure, there are some upsetting scenes; the McDougals abuse as well as the whole Sawyer saga but in comparison to *The Shining* those moments are fleeting, a paragraph at most. All this to say, I don't think I'll actively seek out rereads of *The Shining* after this one. It's a fantastic book, with beautiful building tension but, man, does it ever take a lot out of you emotionally.

For me it is probably Haunting of Hill House, because of how gracefully she handles the interior deterioration of the protagonist.

I went in blind, only knowing that it was loosely based on a true story. I didn’t read about the real case beforehand because I didn’t want to ruin the plot. 

I can’t even give this book a fair rating because I hated the experience of reading it so much. But the author told the story well, so he deserves praise on that front.

1668612899.0,"Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier: Not horror in the true sense but a classic gothic mystery, suspense, thriller not easily pinned down","Rebecca was a surprising read and not the type of story I'm usually drawn to. At this time I've been reading a lot of horror and looking for something with more substance; one of the classics. Rebecca is not a scary supernatural story. There are no literal ghosts or hauntings that take place in the book. The story is hard to pin down, since it contains aspects of a gothic English manor romance, mystery, suspense, thriller and ultimate tragedy. No, though the haunting is not literal, the dominant presence of the dead first wife of Maxim de Winter, Rebecca, lingers and saturates everything within and without the Manderley estate. Told from a future period looking back, Maxim's, at the time of their marriage, unnamed new wife and narrator of the story, is half the age of the forty-two-year-old widower. Rescued from the life as a paid maid/companion to a disgusting, social-climbing, American matron in a Monte Carlo whirlwind romance and marriage, the young Mrs. de Winter is the complete opposite of Rebecca. Coming from a lower social class, she finds that trying to fill the shoes of the deceased Rebecca as lady of the manor is an intimidating task and her new secretive husband is often cold and aloof and not the partner and lover she had hoped for. And then there is the head servant, Mrs. Danvers, like the grim reaper, dressed in black, with a skull-like face who had been an intimate friend and companion to Rebecca growing up. She will be a frightening enemy to the mousy and impressionable new Mrs. de Winter. It is through the young Mrs. de Winter's constant internal stressful daydreamed scenarios that a  haunting portrait of Rebecca is fleshed out. But such imaginative wool gathering can never be relied upon to paint a truly accurate picture of such an overpowering figure gone and never met. And, even in death, the young bride will find that like an invisible parasite Rebecca can reach out from the grave to suck the life out the young wife's new marriage.",horrorlit
1664076931.0,Fairy Tale is the best novel I’ve read in 2022 so far,"“Fairy Tale” by Stephen King was such a delight to read, it’s something you just need to sit back, relax, and enjoy slowly in stride. I loved how as always with King, he brings you back to a time when you were a kid and had to deal with all the usual things kids dealt with. Relationships, sports, family, friends, doing stupid things, and just trying to make sense of it all.

I absolutely loved all the characters King created in this novel. Charlie, Mr. Bowditch, Leah, and even the fantasy characters were all fantastic. Now, for me personally, when it comes to Radar, I became a dog owner for the first time in my life back in 2021 as she really connected with me. I have a cockapoo by the name of Ozzy Skywalker and reading about Radar really hit home for me in so many ways. 

All the interactions, situations, events, and descriptions were exactly that of a dog and how a dog owner would react. I can imagine if you’re also a dog owner, you will feel the same way as you connect immediately with the dynamic duo of Charlie and Radar and the adventures that await them.

Don’t worry, I will not ruin anything for you but this novel is simply amazing. The way King blurred reality into fantasy completely blew me away. Even all the scary and horror situations were perfect that led to an awesome fairy tale story that was unique and just so good. The atmosphere, world-building, character development, and the pure creepiness of everything King built just really resonated well with me. Once I got to the 80% mark, it was incredibly hard to put this down to see what would ultimately transpire.

Also, the illustrations for each chapter brought me back to my childhood as I remembered reading a lot of horror and mystery novels that did this. I have no idea who created these graphics for King in every chapter but they were great and captured the essence of each one. As I read, I’d often head back to see the image just to give me that visual as it happened. Just really well done!

When it comes to the ending, it really delivered after such a climactic buildup. I had no idea what would transpire but when it did, my goodness, it was wonderful and wrapped up an unforgettable novel. It was simply a perfect way to end things that left me beyond satisfied.

I give “Fairy Tale” a perfect 5/5 and so far in 2022 at the time of this review, is the best novel I’ve read. King published this novel in September which is his birthday month. Considering he just turned 75 years young and wrote yet another impactful novel, truly made this year a great one for Constant Readers all across the globe. I highly recommend this novel to anyone that loves King, fantasy, horror, and wants to see what happens when both worlds ultimately collide.",horrorlit

1666040065.0,‘The Women of Weird Tales’ is a fantastic short story collection especially if you want to appreciate some lesser known authors.,"The women of weird tales features 13 short stories from 4 different women that contributed to weird tales, these stories were published between 1925 and 1949. The stories were perfect for spooky season, and most of them had amazing gothic settings (something I love). Most of these women and stories have faded into obscurity despite them being very popular in their time. I didn’t dislike a single story in this collection, and I loved so many of them it’s hard to pick a favorite. As I was reading these stories all I could think was that it was criminal that the work of these women isn’t well documented. I figured in the spirit of giving some lesser known authors some recognition I’d kick off this post with a quick run down on the lives of these women.  



**Greye La Spina** was born in 1880 in Massachusetts, in adulthood she moved to New York City where she worked as a stenographer and photographer. She produced over 100 pieces of fiction (serials, short stories, plays, and novels). Invaders of the dark seems to have been her most popular work as it’s the only one that was published as a hard cover. She also enjoyed weaving as a hobby. Based on reader votes and letters it seems like La Spina was one of the most popular weird tales writers. Unfortunately there isn’t much information on her.


**Eli colter** (her real name was May Eliza Frost) was born in 1890 in Portland oregon. At age 13 she went blind, but eventually regained her sight. She worked in movie theaters as a piano and organ player. Colter published her first story at age 32 in black mask magazine, and She continued writing from there. she mostly wrote westerns but also dabbled in weird fiction. Weird Tales readers voted Her 4 part serial “On Dead Mans Chest” as the most popular story of April 1926, and her story “The Last Horror” was voted most popular story of January 1927. Colter also liked to combine the western and horror genres, and she may have been the first author to do so. While writers Robert E Howard, and Charles G Finney are credited as the creators of the genre Colters supernatural Westerns predate theirs, indicating Colter is most likely the true creator of ‘Weird Westerns’.  Her first husband was a cowboy she met while doing research for her writing, her second husband was another writer that she collaborated with. Colter stopped writing in the 50’s after the death of her second husband, she died in 1984 and was completely unknown by the time she passed.


**Everil Worrell** was born in 1893 in Loop City Nebraska, as an adult she settled in Washington D.C and began working as a stenographer for the U.S treasury department. She kept this job her entire writing career and seems to have excelled at it, in 1957 she was awarded the Albert Gallatin award for her years in service. While only 24 of her stories are still known today it’s believed that she was far more prolific than that, fan letters indicate that Worrell was one of the most popular weird tale writers of her time. Her 1926 story “The Bird of Space” was voted as one of the most popular stories to ever appear in the magazine. It seems Worrell and her husband were huge geeks, they liked to spice up their day by describing mundane chores in Lovecraftian language. Worrell was also a talented painter, and violin player. 


**Mary Elizabeth Counselman** was born in 1911 in Birmingham Alabama. This setting influenced Counselman to produce some delightful southern gothic tales. Counselman began writing when she was 6 years old, when she was a teenager she wrote her most popular story “The Three Marked Pennies”. A few years after writing it the story was published in august 1934, it was reprinted 17 times and translated into 9 languages making it on of the most successful stories in weird tales history. Counselman studied at the university of Alabama, after graduation she become a reporter for a Birmingham newspaper and taught creative writing at Gadsten state Junior College. Counselman and her husband lived on a houseboat. Something that stands out about Counselmans writing is that she did not shy away from challenging racial inequality in her work. This was obviously rare for white writers in her time, but especially rare for white writers born in the Deep South. Counselman also wrote about other taboo subjects such as ableism and abortion.


These are my favorite stories from each author

•’The Remorse of Professor Panebianco’ by: Greye La Spina: An evil mad Scientist wants to trap a soul in a jar and he will stop at nothing to achieve this


•’The Canal’ by: Everil Worrell: a carmilla-esque Vampire story, this is one of Everil Worrells most famous works.


•’The Curse of A Song’ by: Eli Colter: A family is cursed, this curse activates every time a certain song plays. Unfortunately this was the only Eli Colter story in the collection, it was also my absolute favorite story in the entire collection.


•’The Web of Silence’ by: Mary Elizabeth Counselman: A Mayor receives a threatening letter demanding he sends $250,000 down the River in an oil can. The letter warns that if he does not do this something tragic will happen to the town on April 11th. The Mayor does not entertain these demands and on April 11th the entire town becomes completely void of all sound.


Overall this was a great collection, they clearly followed trends of the time but part of the fun was getting to enjoy and experience old horror tropes. I’m going to go hunt down all of these women’s remaining stories.",horrorlit

1618673103.0,Just finished reading The Terror,"And I'm glad I did! Up until recently, I wasn't sold on it, mainly due to its length and that people either saying it's amazing or a tedious chore to get through. There doesn't seem to be any middle ground. I kept seeing recommendations for it on this sub, so on a whim I picked up a used copy at Half Price Books.

I could not put it down. I'm a survival horror fanatic and The Terror checked off damn near every box. A group of people stranded in an isolated, desolate location, being stalked and killed off by a monstrous supernatural beast, all while dealing with disease and dwindling food supplies at the same time. Characters trying to survive a horrible, seemingly inescapable situation and a monster that's absolutely unstoppable. No matter how far the characters traveled, the thing on the ice was always there, following them, watching from afar, and killing and eating the few animals around to deprive the men of food. That's exactly the kind of thing I love!

A couple scenes that really stood out to me were the first real appearance of the monster, the cat and mouse chase between the monster and HMS Terror's ice master, the carnival fire, and of course >!the cannibalism!<. The situation just kept getting worse and worse, which kept me intrigued and invested. I knew it would end poorly given it's based on a real historical event, but I wanted to know exactly *what* sorts of terrible things would befall the characters.

However, I've got one major bone to pick with the book. The ending. 

After >!that shitweasel Cornelius Hickey finally meets his demise !<it ceases to be a horror novel. The last 100 pages are first devoted to an overly detailed exposition dump (which, in my opinion ruined the mystery of the monster and made it not scary any more) and then focuses on >!Crozier being found, rescued and healed by Lady Silence, then randomly falling in love with, marrying and havings kids with her (which came completely out of nowhere) and living with the 'Real People'. Then the book ends, and it's never revealed what happened to the 30 or so final survivors who tried for the river. Did the thing on the ice kill them? Disease or starvation? Did they freeze to death? I wanted an answer to that and didn't care about the living with the Esquimeux stuff.!< The ending wasn't *bad*, but it felt so jarringly out of place with the rest of the book.

But overall, The Terror was a great read and I'll definitely be checking out Dan Simmon's other works.

Now he’s met Rosha Nelson, the girl of his dreams. And he’s never been happier. Until a strange figure with a terribly scarred face starts following him everywhere and horrible accidents start happening every time Rosha’s around. Has dating Rosha made Brady’s dreams come true?

So when she starts receiving dead flowers from a secret “admirer” named The Sun, she just assumes it’s a harmless fan. But Selena soon realizes that The Sun is serious...dead serious. Selena doesn’t know what this psycho wants. All she knows is that her number-one fan has become her number-one nightmare.

>And in *The Runaway*, Shadyside sounded like such a nice town, the perfect place for a runaway like Felicia. Nobody here would know about her dark powers. Nobody would know what she had done. For once, she could be a normal girl. She could be safe. But someone in Shadyside discovered Felicia’s secret. Someone found out about the awful things her powers made her do. Felicia doesn’t want to run away again. But if she stays, she might lose control. And then people would start to die.

1650058683.0,"Honest question: people who want trigger warnings, what makes you choose Horror Lit?","Like the title says, this is an honest question. It may just be that I don’t understand the idea of trigger warnings (Gen X here), but it seems like people who have legitimate fears and concerns about what they might read might be more interested in a gentler genre?  Please educate me. 

My favorite things to read have surprises and thought-provoking perspectives that I did not expect. I think Horror does this best.  This is so true that I prefer not to read even what the book is about.  If it’s a new author I’m trying out, I might want to know the basic subject. Like, this book is about vampires. Or this book is about post-nuclear war survival.  But if it’s an author I already know I enjoy, I won’t even want to know that. I prefer to let my guard down completely. 

I know everyone is not like me, but asking for trigger warnings from a genre that prides itself on surprises and scares is so counter-intuitive to me that I can’t just chalk it up to different people with different preferences.  I’ve seen enough mention of it to have to ask about this. I would love to hear different perspectives so I can better understand.

1627518724.0,The Exorcist Audiobook is incredible,"I think that it was scarier than the film, and the writing is extremely beautiful at times. The last two hours were mind blowing because of all the religious insight from Merrin, Chris’s descriptions of him, and the amazing voice work the author-and narrator-employs during the exorcism scenes. I had goosebumps in the middle of the day in AZ listening to it.

It does lull a bit at times, but overall I would give it a 4 out of 5 and a 5 out of 5 for the audio portion. An amazing work of literature and an amazing audiobook.

I think l’ll listen to The Lesser Dead next because that’s come up in a few audiobook discussions on here. Open to any recommendations though but something shortish would be nice.

I have spoken to others and many have felt the same way. Perhaps it is to modern of a book for core readers, but there is something in the style of writing of this book that it immediately captures you.

I remember feeling the yellow lines described in the book or key finding scene that somehow felt like I was there.

1612026093.0,"Just read John the Posthumous, by Jason Schwartz. A horrifying puzzle, a combination of slow-burn creep and pure beautiful prose.","Many horror stories place common people in extraordinary, terrifying circumstances, the reader putting themselves in the protagonist's shoes through the enchantment of good writing. Other horror stories attempt deceiving the reader, convincing them if just for an inkling of a second that what they read actually happened, deriving horror from their own uncertainty.

*John the Posthumous* takes neither approach, dependent on the fact that *John the Posthumous* doesn't *have* a story, per se. In place of narrative, our narrator relays historical facts concerning Biblical translations, etymology, insects, houses, etc., interjecting this stream-of-consciousness-esque style with constant reference to certain motifs. Fire, sharp objects, red, white, black.

> The crying wife, in folklore, is carried from a house - a burning house, in those unfortunate drawings - and then down a road and through a town - or across a field and through a forest - in a wooden bed. (The cannons seem charmless from this angle.) Thence south, perhaps, in a rainstorm, past the sorrow in the burrows, the jackchain and the shooting wall, and now, near a creek or a lake, the sounds of a drowning. A family stands in the grass - the boards red in the background, the steepless green.

It slowly occurs to the reader that very few of these assertions base themselves in reality. One must analyze the novel to find what's *really* going on. Find the patterns.

One may not read *John the Posthumous* like a regular novel. It ferments in your head, the sinister tone of Satanic references, interjected horrific scenes, images of burning houses. One may, however, find themselves cursed to read the novel through the sheer prose quality.

> The Devil's animal, in the storybooks, is found at the father's house, sometimes composed of white rope. Brown cats, rather than black, are thrown at prisoners en route to the tower. The remains are green, or seem so - while a table hobbles in the next town.

The novel resembles a mad man's ramblings, laying in his death bed, frantically writing everything he knows. I compare it most to *House of Leaves* as a popular example but, rather than a sprawling novel, *John the Posthumous* is a condensed package of pure slow-burn horror, only 154 pages. Nonsense composes the book, and the more you stare at the book, the more it stares at you back.",horrorlit

It was a heartbreaking story about a fucked up family, trauma and exploitation, which is fine, but its not what I got the book for. 

The absolute gut-punch of an ending helped redeem it a bit in my eyes and I've been thinking back on it a bit, but overall its a book that I wont be revisiting.

I'm a high school English teacher in the states and my class has let me know that they have an interest in horror (I did a survey to see what they wanted to study as we end the semester).

I have figured that I'd do a ""History of Horror Lit."" where we'd read short stories or excerpts from important/influential/classic horror stories starting with early writings and moving up through the years. 

Here's my list so far of stories I'm thinking of including:

(1818) Excerpt from Frankenstein

(1819) ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow""

(1835) ""Young Goodman Brown""

(1839) ""The Fall of the House of Usher""

(1889) Excerpt from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

(1882) ""The Yellow Wallpaper""

(1897) Excerpt from Dracula

(1902) ""The Monkey's Paw""

(1927) ""The Colour Out of Space""

(1948) ""The Lottery""

This list is not fully set, and I'd like to have some more modern stuff as well (I'm not super knowledgeable about King's work, but I have been thinking about including him just because he's so famous in the genre), but I have some specific needs. I can't do something that is over the top gore or that includes a lot of foul language and it needs to be relatively short (20 pages or less would be ideal, 30 is pushing it for time).

So what do you all think? Any advice or recommendations?

Thanks!

Edit: I know this list has a very western, British and American bent to it mostly because that's the lit I'm the most familiar with. If there's any stories from other countries or cultures that you think I should included, I'd love to hear about them :)

Did I like the book? Very much so! It seems people either love it or hate it- i would definitely recommend it. Only ONE thing really bugged me: when you try to write German nouns or phrases as part of the story. WHY does nobody check if they are correct? Der Platz der Fischer - no it is ""Der Platz des Fischers"". Schwarzkunstler instead of Schwarzkünstler etc :D. Maan, it is way less spooky if your wittness sounds like a three- year old.

After seeing the comments: I enjoyed the change of perspective and the end, but understand it is too explicit for some readers to be classified as ""cosmic horror"".

Don't get me wrong: I do not think that Langan should be able to speak German, but in all the processes involved to publish a book, none of the editors came up with the idea: Maybe we check the German phrases? :D

1662016965.0,Happy 10 Year Anniversary r/HorrorLit!!!,"Hello everyone,

From the tippy top of my heart down through my black and sticky soul I want to wish this community an extremely happy TEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY!

To celebrate I encourage each community member to share their personal story of discovery and experience with this genre we all love.  If you like, please share how you feel about r/HorrorLit. As always criticism is embraced as well as praise.

Were you around during the height of the 70s/80s mass market paperback horror boom picking the most lurid covers from the spinner at the grocery checkout aisle? Perhaps the Almighty Algorithm directed you to the right TikTok at the right time? Whatever your secret origin, we want to know!

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those interested, I'll share a brief history of the community below.

Years ago, u/GradyHendrix, yes [THAT Grady Hendrix](http://www.gradyhendrix.com/), joined the community and after being a very active community member (seriously, look at his post history, it's an absolute treasure trove of Horror Lit everything) eventually became a moderator. Let me share his own words from a few years ago:

>BORING THINGS ABOUT THE PAST A long time ago, this mod had about 300 members. Maybe less? I really thought it could be a cool place and started posting every day. Eventually I became a moderator, and was on here constantly, posting links, policing the sub, participating in discussions, starting discussions, running polls, and working to purge inactive mods and bring in newer, more active mods. \[...\] My goal was to get this sub rolling and make sure it didn't shrink to its former tiny size.  
>  
>CUT TO: THE PRESENT This sub has a LOT of members. My goal has been accomplished. These days I poke my head in when I can, delete spam, respond to mod mail when I see it, and generally just marvel at the fact that it seems to keep on going without my having to do much of anything.  

About two years ago, as this community neared crossing 100,000 members, Grady chose myself and u/xorobas to be part of a new mod team to maintain the community as the demands of his literary career began to consume more of his time. Thus, Grady crossed the veil and ascended to that rarified place known only as ""The New York Times Best-Selling Author"" list, where I'm told horrors more unimaginable that the deepest depths of cosmic despair await. Eventually the amazing and incredibly hardworking u/SpeculativeFantasm joined our mod team and is the most active of us as the demands of u/xorobas and my careers and lives grew larger and restricted the amount of time we could spend with you.

About three months after our appointment, and almost exactly two years ago, r/HorrorLit crossed the 100K threshold. Now, our ever expanding community has 333K members! 

When I first came upon this community around the 5000 members mark, I never imaged this community would grow much beyond that. Today, I'm awed and humbled by the passion, comradery, and dedication of the members of this community. We have a well earned reputation as one of the nicest, most welcoming, and least judgmental communities across all of reddit. A reputation that the mods don't even have to work much to maintain because of YOU. You, the community member, are what makes this forum what it is. As a community, we are only a reflection of our members and as such one can easily infer our members are nicest and most amazing people on the internet.

Thank you once again for making this place so amazing. There are some exciting things coming up for this community so stay posted and keep involved.

With love,

\-HIL

I will say a few negatives before though. Firstly, I found that closer to the end the book got a lot less scary, but that’s okay. I was a little bit disappointed that the suspense wasn’t built up better. Finally, and I know I may get hate for this because people hate comparing him to Stephen king because he’s his son and so on. But I will say that while I acknowledge that they both are separate people, a few of the scares from this book felt very IT-like. But now let’s get into the positives. First, there were a few scenes in this book that actually scared me! This is very rare for me to feel, and to be honest, I haven’t felt this in literature since reading the shining almost a year ago. I also loved how fleshed out the characters were! Like there was actual character development which is somewhat rare to see in horror. Finally, I really enjoyed how quick paced this book was and how it kept you on your toes almost the entire time. Overall I’d give this a 4/5 stars.",horrorlit

1683697733.0,“Death of a Bookseller” needs to jump to the top of your TBR,"I’m a bookseller myself and I bought this because I wanted a cozy bookstore murder mystery and the title and cover seemed to confirm that’s what I was about to read. I was wrong in the best way. This is a disturbing, creeping dread, social horror novel that I think really had something to say about it’s topic. 

Synopsis: Roach is a bookseller with an unhealthy obsession with serial killers and true crime. She’s a perpetual loner who loves that she’s different from the “normies” who don’t have the same twisted interests as herself. Her shop brings in a seasonal employee, Laura, who Roach becomes instantly enamored with. Laura, unbeknownst to Roach, is the daughter of a victim of a local serial killer, who writes anti true crime poetry to criticize the exploitation of the dead. Roach misinterprets the poetry and believes that she and Laura are destined to be bound in a true crime styled sisterhood, leading her to further and darker violations of Laura’s privacy, such as reading her diary, stealing her clothes, stalking her, and hiding in her house. Will this obsession turn deadly?

1613628497.0,Early verdict: I love Clive Barker,"Just started reading books of blood after years of laziness (hellraiser is one of my favorite films so this was long overdue). Midnight Meat Train might be the best modern lovecraftian work I’ve read. It effectively captures the dread and sense of helplessness against forces infinitely more powerful than any individual, while also applying it for a modern audience (one that uses subways for example).

On top of that, I’ve really come to love Barker’s prose. He’s so good at effectively conveying his ideas in few words. And on top of that, he has a dark sense of humor which really endears his works to me. Sick as it may make me seem, this passage from Meat Train had me almost laughing out loud:

“Then the hand was out of his mouth and the scarlet, spittle-covered fingers were in front of his face, with his tongue, held between thumb and forefinger. 
Kaufman was speechless.”

Barker’s prose is so engaging that it’s almost conversational and friendly. But he also retains that ability to make the reader feel so horrified and disgusted with what they have read that it’s still incredibly powerful.

NOT to be confused with like ""supernatural adult romance"" novels where the dude is like a werewolf or some shit and it's almost like an erotica with ""horror"" (and I use the term loosely) themes. I am so not a fan of Mr. Six-pack Devil-May-Care Ripped-Shirt Big-Peepee Johnson. 

I mean a book that is of the horror genre, the main plot IS horror, but with a lil bit of romance. Like maybe two characters falling for each other in the middle of the chaos. 

Like I'm reading There's Someone Inside Your House and (now I'm only 6 chapters in and I've never seen the movie) there is something like that happening with two of the characters and I like that. 

I don't care if one of the romantic interests ends up being the bad guy either (which I suspect might be the case in my current book). I just like the budding romance. 

Could be geared towards adults or YA. Though I prefer the former. And I don't mind a sex scene,  so long as it's tasteful and the book isn't sex heavy itself",horrorlit
1686281548.0,Stephen King's Night Shift has reminded me why I love horror short stories so much.,"I'm going through the book now, just over halfway through having just finished Sometimes They Come Back, which is what prompted this as it's an absolute 10/10 story.

One of the longer in the book, it just oozes anxiety throughout - following a teacher recovering from trauma and struggles in his life time, as students of his are being replaced by thugs from his childhood. That's about all I knew about it going in, and if you haven't read it, stop here and fix that. The story ramps up perfectly, and has what is easily one of my favorite endings King has done.

Beyond that, I don't think I'll ever be forgetting the unease of I Am The Doorway. The slow unveiling story of some alien thing creeping its way into our world through some hapless former astronaut, and bringing its pure hatred with it.

And then there's Battleground, which is just plain fun, not horror at the slightest but instead a ridiculously over the top fight between a professional killer and a box of army men in what could easily be turned into a ridiculous die hard style story that I hope someone picks up. 

If you're sleeping on this collection, it is extremely solid and more than worth your time.",horrorlit

1629065927.0,Currently reading House of Leaves... holy shit.,"This book was given to me by a friend of mine, who knows that I enjoyed *The King in Yellow* and who hosts me and a bunch of other friends for Arkham Files-type board games every week or so. All he told me going in is that ""house"" is always blue, ""~~minotaur~~"" is always red, and that the paperback cover is smaller than the hardback one.

I'm not even a quarter of the way through it yet and I gotta say I fucking love it. It's... surprisingly immersive, given the very clinical way it's written (which makes sense, given that it presents itself as academic) - I can easily visualize the events of *The Navidson Record* as I read it.

In the early 1990s I read a short story -- I want to say it was by a young adult in a collection of YA-written short stories -- called ""By the Light of the Moon"". It was a pretty typical werewolf story about a boy who sees his sister eaten by werewolves. Maybe he participates, and maybe there's some very oblique incesty type hints? There was an illustration of the werewolves that is probably the single scariest thing I had ever seen at the time. I'm prepared to be amused at how scary this whole thing isn't, but I need help tracking it down!",horrorlit
1665043889.0,Cujo by Stephen King is simultaneously the best and worst book I've ever read.,"It's been on my list to read ever since I first heard of it around the age of 12, when I was reading every single book I could get my hands on. I'm iffy with King books - I either love them or can't get into them. I've read Pet Sematary at least 5 times, read The Shining last year during a winter power outage (perfect backdrop to read that book), and have a couple others I'll get around to eventually.

But man, Cujo tops the list.

It was interesting with the story and character building from the beginning, and the lack of chapter breaks really made it hard to end off where I normally would. The way it switched between the different characters and scenes flowed so well that I found myself reading several pages past where I planned to take a break. The last 150 pages were a sort of whirlwind that I raced through, but the tension made me have to put it down a couple times to catch my breath.

The ending absolutely was not what I expected. I had a feeling of what would happen, but it definitely made me cry.

All in all I'm definitely glad I read it, but I don't think I ever will again. It's gonna stick with me for a very, very long time.",horrorlit

1601871692.0,"Just finished Emily Carroll's graphic novel ""Through the Woods"", it is brilliant. Check out her free work online!","Heard it described as ""gothic horror"". She managed to tell 5 succinct, hellaciously creepy stories set in the country, each on the edge of a horrible, horrible woods. The narrative framing of the story brings the author's childhood fears right to you.

She sets up awful, mysterious situations, sends you along with the character into a horrible spiral, and then... *leaves you there*. She ends the stories at the perfect times, never quite answering every question you have but making sure you *know* it is awful. 

The illustrations are bold, dismal, haunting, and beautiful all at the same time. I almost don't want to return it to the library, I'll probably be spooking my future kids with it, haha. So yeah, Definitely check out **Through the Woods** by **Emily Carroll**. 

**ALSO!**

She has an AWESOME website where she has free webcomics that are just as good! Find all those here: http://www.emcarroll.com/

These could be horror stories about the themes and stuff metal songs sing about: torment, monsters, etc. They could also feature metal as part of the setting and characters, like David Peak's *Corpsepaint*.

For examples from other media, the insane Nicholas Cage (but I repeat myself) movie *Mandy*.  Or the role playing game [MÖRK BORG](https://morkborg.com/) (yes, all caps).

1650827169.0,Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk,"Holy fuck.

I heard about this book on Tiktok and was intrigued by the medium of the story (told through 23 short stories and poems). Picked up a used copy at Powell’s while visiting Portland and finished it by the time I got on the plane to come home.

My first 5-star read of the year and probably one of the best books I’ve read: my explanation could not do it justice. Reading a Palahniuk book is a lot like dreaming; when you’re in the midst of it everything makes perfect sense. It’s not confusing, everything ties together easily. It’s only once you wake up that you realize “what the fuck was that?”

I’ve run into myself trying to explain the plot to friends and realizing that it’s SO complex. There are so many aspects, characters, forms of commentary that I just can’t cover, and yet when I’m reading the book I’m not at all lost or confused. In fact, I followed the plot so well that I noticed when we hadn’t heard from a character in a while. FOR ME THAT IS HUGE. I am usually extremely inattentive and have to reread things several times to comprehend them, which is frustrating as hell.

No, Haunted is the rare horror novel that will never leave you feeling lost or confused. Rather, it’s like sharing an extremely complex inside joke with the author, one that makes perfect sense to both of you but would be difficult to explain to anyone else.

I really can’t sing its praises enough, it’s a perfectly balanced novel. It’s a horrific, gross, disheartening, witty, curious, beautiful, hilarious book.

5/5 stars <3

Initially I was planning to go through each thread and scrape all of the recs. I was even going to provide Goodreads links for them. Then I discovered there were **123 of the things** (as of 11 July 2023) and quickly abandoned that foolish notion. 

Instead, please peruse these threads at your leisure and feel free to link this thread the next time you see the request appear, because realistically it is unlikely to be anymore than a few days away.

PS - None of these count the literally dozens of times The Deep (Cutter) gets its own dedicated threads. If I had to guess I'd say there are 80+. I was initially considering adding these in as their own side category just for fun, but similarly to the main post I then realised just how often it gets posted and abandoned that idea. The Deep (Katsu), Dead Sea (Curran) and Into The Drowning Deep (Grant) are probably the three next most prevalent dedicated threads that appeared.

The ones in this post do not include any of the above reviewing/discussing individual books.

1626259725.0,"I'm looking for some horror with erotic themes - but not erotica, and strictly nothing with scenes of assault.","I recently watched 1982's Cat People, and the mingling of body horror, animalistic intensity, and the intertwining of sex and fear really worked for me. I'm looking for some novels that give me that same vibe - erotic horror, rather than horror erotica.

Importantly, I really don't want anything with a focus on sexual assault. Given that, I'd prefer something by a female author, or a Queer author, but that's not an absolute rule, so long as it's tasteful (or tastefully distasteful)

Thank you in advance!

1684448483.0,Just finished Tender Is The Flesh and holy shit,"TW: animal death and torture

y’all what the fuck 😐

that was probably the most depraved book i have read EVER. literally just stood on the shower just flabbergasted.

i’m gonna have to read a romance book or soemthing but as i look at my shelves, i realize i have no romance books! 

my expectations were shattered. i totally thought that Marcos and Jasmine were gonna run away and be together to raise their son but no. Cecilia delivers the baby and they fucking KILL HER. as i ponder back, i realize he never cared about her, only the baby in her stomach. 

also fuck those teens that killed those puppies. i had to grit my teeth as i sped through that part, awful.

as i logged my progress on Goodreads, i saw someone who didn’t rate it and said “i’m not going to rate it because i just can’t rate it. it is what it is.” and i agree with that wholeheartedly.

anyways, that book is fucked but it was good. read it in 2 days. if i DID have to rate it, 4.3/5 mainly for the puppies. i understand it needed to happen for the plot but i just wish it wasn’t as graphic as it was",horrorlit
1680569283.0,Anyone else find themselves gravitating more toward older books?,"Lately newer books just aren't doing it for me. every time I think I found a book that seems good it turns out to be a huge disappointment. A lot of current horror books seem almost watered down as if they were written for a much younger audience. also they seem to focus more on representation than a good story. no I don't have an issue with it, it's just the way it seems to be the entire book sometimes.

1600262578.0,The Institute is Stephen King's Breakfast Can Wait to Stranger Things.,"So the Duffer Brothers don't hide how heavily Stephen King influenced their Netflix series Stranger Things. Some argue it is literally set in the Stephen King universe. Now King comes out with The Institute which reads more like some of his older novels such as Firestarter specifically.  Shadowy  organizations getting up to shenanigans. You'd be forgiven for thinking it actually sounds a lot like Stranger Things, but what are they going to do, sue him? 

This is where Breakfast Can Wait comes in. On the Chappelle Show Dave reenacted a Charlie Murphy story of playing Prince in basketball and then they all had pancakes. Later, displaying an awesome sense of humor, Prince used a photo of Chappelle dressed as him on the album cover Breakfast Can Wait. 

That's what King did here. He went back to some of his more classic topics from the 80s and sort of copied the copy of him. I think it is really funny.",horrorlit

1710030772.0,Between Two Fires by Chris Buehlman was incredible,"I made a post about this book a few days ago through the first 12ish chapters and it gained decent traction, so I figured I'd give my thoughts now that I'm totally finished. I feel like I can give a different perspective because I would never consider myself a fan of horror in any medium, and this book would be great for someone trying to get into horror literature. 

Buehlman's writing is slightly advanced. Keeping up with 14th century vernacular can be difficult, but he made it as easy as possible to navigate. He spent the perfect amount of time detailing a characters image and the setting. I can't stand when someone goes on and on with every minute detail, and Buehlman gave to exactly what you needed without rambling. 

The characters aren't the most unique in terms of archetypes, but they're executed so well. Thomas is your typical anti-hero who ends up on this journey begrudgingly after saving Delphine from his own crew. He's honestly the only character from the main trio with any major progression in my opinion, and he is my favorite from the book. His humor and the playful, yet brutal, back and forths he has with others (Delphine in particular) are hilarious. He is a shining example of what makes this book so great - the perfectly timed humor throughout this horrific tale. Delphine can be annoying at times, but I feel like this was intentional. I'm a grown man, so I'm looking at the events through a grown man's eyes, and it would be extremely frustrating to deal with a young girl crying over a flute when literal Hell has been brought to Earth. However, her ability to remain a child throughout the story kept everything pleasantly grounded. I also love how she was more so a vessel rather than a ""chosen one"" character type. The Priest, Matthieu, was the glue to the group. The one who kept Thomas from offing Delphine when he was being headstrong, but also making sure Delphine understood the gravity of the situation when she was being emotional. He's the most stereotypical character to me, the heavily flawed priest, but I didn't mind it. The way this group came together, and the way both Matthieu and Thomas protected Delphine, was so humbling. They made me laugh and cry numerous times throughout. This book is a decent length, not incredibly long, but I felt like I knew them throughout a 10 book series. The side characters were also great. Most of them are very short lived, but Buehlman maximized their ""screen time."" Jehan and Annette, and the big man on the raft leave a huge impact on the whole story despite lasting maybe 2 chapters each.

The horror in this was unsettling. Like I said in my first post, I didn't think a book could ever scare me, but this scared the shit out of me. What I loved was the mental horror was just as bad as the physical horror. My only complaint about the entire book, which is very nitpicky, is the scariest part was fairly early with the Paris arc. Other parts were still great and also scary, but I lost sleep over Paris and it stuck with me for days (honestly still with me). 

I truly do give this a 10/10 and wish I had someone to lend the book to just so we could talk about it

-	The Troop was… both squicky and heartbreaking.

1649110366.0,"Night of the Mannequins is an insane, creepy, and chilling read","“Night of the Mannequins” by Stephen Graham Jones was the first time I ever read anything by him and wow, this novella didn’t disappoint! At first, I wasn’t sure what to expect but my goodness, once things start to go down, it was a creepy read from beginning to end. I definitely didn’t see things going down the way that they did as I loved his writing style, pacing, and the sheer horror of this novella as I kept reading.

I genuinely enjoyed reading this and while I won’t spoil anything, this is the perfect nightly read in bed or something to scare you to start a weekend off right. It’s an insane and chilling ride through the depths of one hell of an imagination. Needless to say, I will definitely be reading more of his previous and upcoming work as Graham Jones delivered nicely in this one.

I give “Night of the Mannequins” by Stephen Graham Jones a perfect 5/5 in my book as it checks all the boxes and then some. The storytelling here is on point as everything from the characters, settings, and situations all led to one of the most unique novellas I’ve ever read.

For reference in terms of horror, I've been on a Stephen King kick and am taking a break to read Dan Simmons more. Recommendations for period pieces like The Terror would be welcomed if set during medieval times!



EDIT: Thanks all for the great responses! Figured I'd tally up the top 3 recommendations from the discussions that were had for anyone else looking for a similar vibe/story.


1. Between Two Fires by Christopher Buehlman
This seemed to be the most highly recommended and closest to hitting all the points I was looking for. Horror elements, historical fiction, and set during The Black Death. Perfect!


2. The Buried Giant by Kuzuo Ishiguro
Sounds like this will hit my itch for Arthurian themes/tales and sounds to be a good blend of realism and fantasy/mythology. Definitely the second most recommended in the thread.



3. Once and Future King by T.H. White. I don't know that I'll dive into this one right away as it sounds more whimsical than what I'm in the mood for right now. Regardless there were a lot of positive recommendations for this one. 


Personally my own #3 is to just read the original Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and see how it holds up!",horrorlit
1608947260.0,House of Leaves for Christmas,"So I just got the hardcover, full color edition of House of Leaves from my spouse, and I just wanted to share my excitement and the start of my journey.  It seems to be kind of a polarizing book on Reddit, but I decided to finally just go for it and see what the fuss is all about. Wish me luck!

Edit: so I noticed that this book, the hardcover at least, seemed bigger than a normal hardcover, but I wasn’t sure, thought it might be messing with my head already..I measured, and it’s bigger width wise and a little bigger, height wise, and I sort of think that’s on purpose to mess with you? Thoughts?",horrorlit
1599935295.0,"This book gave me nightmares: ""The 2020 Commission Report""","The full title is [The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States: A Speculative Novel](https://www.amazon.com/Commission-Report-Nuclear-Attacks-Against-ebook/dp/B079VDR6HM). The premise is that in March 2020, an incident between the Koreas spirals out of control and results in the use of nuclear weapons.

The book is very dry, written more like a history textbook than a novel, but I found it to be gripping. It's horrifying in its plausibility. It's short, so I read it in just a couple of days, but night before last I had literal nightmares about it.

Be warned, though: This book is *very* critical of the (barely fictionalized) Trump administration. American politics being what they are, you might not like that aspect of the book, but I found that it added to the horror. The book walks a thin line between depicting a hypothetical Trump administration response to an attack and satirizing the administration, so if that's not your cup of tea, look elsewhere.

All in all, I think horror is in the eye of the beholder, and this book, while not intended to be horror in the conventional sense, definitely horrified me.",horrorlit

Well, I've been on a horror binge lately and all I can say is, this book did NOT disappoint.

It was so well written. It has mystery, drama, and very good scares. And Damien Karras was *so* much better written in the book compared to the movie. You have so much more time with him and his character traits and it makes his arc so much better by the end.

1.) Revival by Stephen King... this book is a little slow at first but oh my god... literally made me question everything I know
2.) A Head Full of Ghosts by Paul Tremblay... literally cried while reading this, it was so fucking riveting that I just sat in my chair for an hour after I was done with it...

1657153509.0,Unpopular Opinion: World War Z sucks,"I am talking about the book. We all know the movie sucked. That's not an unpopular opinion, it's just consensus.

World War Z, the book, seems to be in EVERY horror list, in no small portion because it broke into the mainstream.

In the spirit of respect for art, let me list things I, in fact, liked:

\- The concept of a collection of oral histories is creative

\- Brooks' book is very well-researched, and he really walks you through the minutiae of an emergency scenario. He ""predicted"" some of the Big Power dynamics - read, between governments - that ensued during the COVID-19 pandemic

\- He made the zombie genre, a somewhat stale one, into something more energic

But you didn't click into this post to read good stuff, did you? Here's why I think the book is not only overrated, but also plain bad:

\- The point of oral histories is capturing a multiplicity of perspectives and voices (full disclosure: I am an academic who works w qualitative methods like oral histories). Nonetheless, THEY ALL SOUND THE SAME. Furthermore, he's only bent on portraying soldiers, neighborhood watch, politicians, and other direct or indirect gunslingers. All the characters sound like ""good ole' boys,"" with no real diversity of viewpoint

\- Politically, the book is a blatant apologia for neo-imperialism, directly a response to disappointment for the U.S. post-Iraq (though Afghanistan was still raging at the time). The tone seems to be, ""Sure, these soldiers made some mistakes, but they are kind-hearted. And really, they are the only hope we have of surviving, no matter whether they make MORE mistakes or sacrifice people's lives."" One of the turning points in the book comes when (SPOILER ALERT) the military uses refugee flows to distract zombies away from general populations. 

There's an argument to be made that portraying an act is not an endorsement; it may be a critique. That much is true about much literature about war, that's in reality, anti-war. However, at no point does Brooks even suggest such a critique. There's a VERY CORNY scene in which an apartheid-era South African general proposes the human-sacrifice initiative, and Nelson FUCKING Mandela himself comes out to endorse it.

\- If I wanted to teach this book, I'd do it next to Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan. It has an absolutely bleak view of human nature (if that's your cup of tea, pick a copy and feed that confirmation bias), in which sacrifices must be made by governments to keep people from going full goblin mode. People, per the book, can hardly survive in their own without the government helping.

Listen, I love dystopian fiction, but most nowadays assumes that misanthropy is blatantly inaccurate. Look, for example, to Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower, or most recently, Station Eleven (I've only read the book, haven't watched the series). In these, there's indeed pandemonium and disaster, but people still manage to survive and even thrive. For a non-fiction view of ""human nature"" under conditions of disaster, I recommend Rebecca Solnit's Hope in the Dark - a hopeful book about the cooperation that ensues under conditions of disaster. 

\- Did I mention the book was corny? Because let me say it again: the book falls into blatant sentimentalism at multiple points. Cliches of patriotism and institutions are present through and through. 

\- Very quickly, the whole ""collection of oral histories"" becomes a facade to hide Brooks' inability/unwillingness to follow a whole plotline to completion. Everything ends too soon.

I'm open to the idea that I may've let my political bias against Brooks' political principles cloud my judgement of the work. But I nonetheless reject that, because I've read many other books - ex. Asimov's work - that really clash w my priors, but at least strike me as imaginative or well-written. 

So you may drag me now. Your disdain for me could hardly match my disdain for this book, especially in a genre that in the past 10 - 20 years has really flourished and produced extraordinary actors.",horrorlit

1608341777.0,Help finding short story about man growing roses that are actually mutilated children,"EDIT: u/temposure found it! It's The Assistant To Dr Jacob by Eric Schaller.

The story is told from the perspective of an adult man reminiscing about his childhood. As a child, he had a neighbor (I think an old man, but perhaps just middle-aged) who was a gardener, and had a greenhouse full of beautiful, well-tended roses. The narrator would sometimes help, or be allowed to watch, the neighbor care for the roses: pruning them, possibly tying them into specific shapes, that sort of thing.

Eventually, it was found out somehow that the neighbor was actually mutilating young girls. I think there were videos or photographs showing their dead bodies, which the narrator saw. There may have been a media scandal, though it didn't play a major role in the story. (It wasn't explained why the narrator saw the corpses as roses; I think it was magical realism or something).
The story ends with the narrator thinking about the time he brought what he thought was a rose home to give to his mother. He saw it as a beautiful flower, but in reality it must have been part of a girl's corpse—maybe a hand? He reflects that he is haunted by a particular question: what did his mother see that day? (I think the final words of the story may have been, verbatim, ""What did she see?"", but googling the phrase has proven unhelpful.)

I have a very clear memory of reading this in the short story collection ""Lies and Ugliness"" by Brian Hodge, but when I looked at a copy of the collection, the story was completely absent. That said, it could be the case that it *is* by Brian Hodge and was just in a different collection to the one I thought it was in.

I read the story sometime prior to 2016, and it's in first-person.

1682368234.0,"Just Finished Tender is the Flesh, and I see why it isn’t everyone’s cup of tea.","Hi, and also *spoilers* 

I just finished Augustina Balterrica’s “Tender is the Flesh” - I will say I was captivated by the idea, the world building and the characterizations because everyone felt so flawed and easy to dislike through the protagonist’s view, it was easy to dislike to many. 

After finishing it, being taken aback by the ending and digesting the matter and plot, I can see why not everyone would be terrified by this read. However, something I haven’t seen discussed yet (and I’m sure it has been I just haven’t come across it) is how a huge theme in the novel is body horror that women face at the hands of men, but also the hysterical woman. It felt like a really fresh retelling of the gothic tropes of the hysterical female and trauma at the hands of the male. 

He uses Jasmine as a brood mare, and we mistake the care of her to be about her and not just his child. The majority of detailed butchering are of female head, and the woman his sister is keeping is being tortured. There is also talk of sexual assault on minors. We only really hear of the slaughters of females (often in detail), and we see a few times men singing to women and “calming them down.” (After they have been conditioned to trust, mind you).

I also wonder, now if his sister really was that intolerable. At the end it is revealed that Marcos is unreliable and not as kind as we believe- perhaps his sister is villainized. His views on the doctor and the female butcher could also be skewed, and he essentially treats her like meat. 
Also on the doctor- the thing he seems most appalled by regarding her is not her horrific “experiments”, but he seems to zone in on how she will never have children and would look down on women who do. 

He also treats his father’s nurse terrible. Once she has “fulfilled” her role of seeing his father out of this world he becomes cold and cruel. 

It seems without a traditional role he finds women tedious, even repulsive. 

I won’t get on a soapbox and go on and on, but I find it a really interesting theme that I feel is maybe the biggest one but often overlooked.",horrorlit

I'm currently building my horror library and that includes graphic novel because I am also a huge comic book geek. The last book I finished was a graphic novel from DC Black Label called Joker. On Amazon, it was rated the creepiest Joker novel ever written and I am here to say that is wrong. The only thing scary about that book is the artwork. Oh, and Defending Jacob by William Landay which was AMAZING. 

At the moment, I am working my way through If You Tell by Greg Olson. Its kinda hitting a little too close to home for me, but I'm gonna finish it anyway.

1565792410.0,Horror and Horror-Adjacent fiction is honestly the best its been in decades right now.,"In movies, we're starting to see the return of directors and crews being more important than franchises. All the major horror franchises are now far less prominent than the works from James Wan, Mike Flanagan, Jordan Peele, Drew Goddard, Ari Aster, Adam Wingard, Robert Eggers, and Jennifer Kent, and those are just some of the ones with great major adaptations to their name, there's too many smaller directors around to count. The genre has been flooded with great original movies, high quality remakes, and adaptations that bring new life to the source material. It's very pleasing and refreshing. We're even getting the first ever big budget, big screen Lovecraft adaptation that I'm aware of, Nic Cage's The Color Out Of Space.

Then there's TV, where what was once an occasional thing that was either very campy or more focused on other things than horror is now replaced by a number of strong, serious horror shows. Campy cable TV horror like Tales from the Crypt has been replaced by shows like Dexter and True Blood, horror adjacent but with actual characters behind them. Anthology horror like Twilight Zone and Are You Afraid of the Dark is still around here and there, particularly with Black Mirror and Masters of Horror, but has largely been replaced by seasonal anthologies like American Horror Story and Haunting of Hill House. There are still some more fun than scary horror series, like Scream TV and Scream Queens, iZombie, Santa Clarita Diet, Stranger Things, and of course Supernatural. There are also some full on serious horror shows in recent years - Walking Dead, Penny Dreadful, Ash Vs The Evil Dead, Castle Rock, Bates Motel, and The Terror. TV is a home for horror like never before.

Then we get to books, which are seeing a number of great authors, way more than I can count. Lovecraftian/Weird Fiction is getting new life breathed into it by Jeff Vandermeer, John Langan, Robert Jackson Bennett, and any number of other authors. New notables seem to be popping up all over with best first novels, like Bird Box and Head Full of Ghosts, as well as amazing translations like Let The Right One In and Hex. Grady Hendrix is running a one man crusade to bring classics back - both with doing books that take on old genres like teen horror and splatterpunk, and working to track down the rights for various horror classics and get them reprinted, making him directly or indirectly responsible for bringing some amazing authors back into print - In particular, this is the first time in decades Michael Mcdowell, imo one of the best horror authors of all time, has been in print. Check him out, and if you wanna read more about classic horror look up Hendrix's fantastic Paperbacks from Hell.

1648823651.0,I read 23 horror books in March and here's a mini review of them all!,"**Standalones**

[What We Harvest by Ann Fraistat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55689047) 2/5 - So many choices the characters made didn't make sense to me. Things like withholding secrets unnecessarily, taking risks for no reason. The ending was also a bit of a let down.  
[Double Threat by F. Paul Wilson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55077677) 2/5 - I had so many issues with this book despite it coming from an author that I really like. Too many instances of r/menwritingwomen and r/PhonesAreBad. I wasn't a fan of how he portrayed the Native American character. And ended on a massive cliff hanger so there wasn't even any real resolution. Only reason this is 2 stars instead of 1 is because despite all that, the author did keep me hooked throughout. Just wish it wasn't such a let down at the end.  
[A Night to Die For by Lisa Schroeder](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58410398) 3/5 - A horror/mystery/YA about a mysterious death during prom. It does a good job of keeping you wanting more, and despite the many characters and switching perspectives, it was an easy and enjoyable read.  
[Bad Seed by William March](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/467032) 4/5 - Also creepy kids are my Achilles heel! Fantastic book, understandably a classic, and still holds up well today.  
[Seed by Ania Ahlborn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11422798) 4/5 - Creepy kid? Check. Malevolent force? Check. Grim and gloomy? Check. Love Ania Ahlborn and her style and this book did not disappoint.  
[The Amityville Horror by Jay Anson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/293101) 4/5 - This is a classic for a reason. It holds up without an issue and there were so many genuinely creepy moments for me.   
[Castaways by Brian Keene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5214006) 4/5 - Super fun! Cast of survivor is are trapped on an island with vicious creatures. What's not to like?. Characters are fleshed out nicely for it being so campy.  
[My Violence by Delilah S. Dawson](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57926112) 4/5 - Oof this was hard to read, especially in the beginning, due to the amount of abuse we see - parental, spousal, and sexual abuse. Also, one case of major animal abuse/cruelty. Despite that (or maybe because of it??), it kept me wanting more and it utilized switching perspectives from 3 generations of women really well to keep up the tension.   
[The Haunted Forest Tour by Jeff Strand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34339545) 4/5 - If you;re interested by the synopsis, you will like this book. There's no bait and switch, it really is what it says it is. Monsters galore, gore aplenty, violence to spare.  
[Sundial by Catriona Ward](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693183) **5/5** - Awesome book! If you're a fan of Last House on Needless Street by Ward, you'll like this one as well. If you didn't like the ending of Needless Street but enjoyed the writing style of the author, you will enjoy this one. Though less twisty/turny, it still has a lot of unknown elements that come together in a big crescendo at the end. I LOVED the ending. Also, I don't typically mention TWs but there are multiple instances of abuse (animal and otherwise).  

**Series**

[Awakened](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35718816-awakened), [The Brink](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41952238-the-brink), and 
[Obliteration by James S. Murray](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48928234-obliteration) 2/5 - If this series was a movie, it would be one of those that went straight to the syfy channel. I was honestly pretty excited about this series because I thought it was gonna be a fun and schlocky read, but unfortunately it was kind of boring. I couldn't get behind any of the MCs, the antagonist was laughable, and the reveal and subsequent climax of the monster was just okay.  
[The Strain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6065215-the-strain), [The Fall](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6723348-the-fall), and [The Night Eternal by Guillermo del Toro](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6945530-the-night-eternal) The first book was super entertaining and a solid 4/5! I thought approaching vampires in a scientific light with a healthy mixture of lore was really cool; not something I've seen a ton of before. And nothing was held back in the gore and violence department. Unfortunately, each successive book was less enjoyable than its predecessor. I really disliked the way book 2 started because all the tension that was built up was just gone. The second book was a 3/5. Third book was a 2/5 and the worst of all. I was honestly kind of bored throughout. Such a disappointing finale because the first book was a ton of fun and left me wanting more. What a huge bummer...   
[Afraid by Jack Kilborn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5122520-afraid) 4/5 - Good execution on a gruesome premise. This fits squarely in splatterpunk category with heaps of violence and gore. Characterization isn't forgotten about either which frequently happens in the body horror category. One negative I have is one character >!Duncan!< annoyed the hell out of me and it took a lot of self control to not just skip past every time they spoke.  
[Trapped by Jack Kilborn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7487212-trapped) 4/5 - There were a couple of things that bothered me in this novel: the perspective changes happened inconsistently and were jarring, and it sometimes felt that you were told to be scared. Despite that I really enjoyed this book because it kept me on wanting more pretty much immediately and it has one of the most badass female protagonists ever.   
[Endurance by Jack Kilborn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8495705-endurance) 3/5 - Entertaining splatterpunk/thriller. I loved all the protagonists and how they're so strong in very different ways. Seeing characters evolve in these kinds of stories is also really fun. My biggest complaint was that the antagonists in this book were a bit goofy and some scenes which were supposed to be scary ended up being kinda funny.  
[Haunted House by Jack Kilborn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17563580-haunted-house) 3/5 - The first three books you can read individually and there's little to no connection between them. This book, though advertised as a standalone as well, takes all the character of the previous books and puts them together. IMO the weakest in the series mainly because of that reason. A lot of what I liked about previous characters kinda went away in the time between the event of their initial story and this book.  
[Panacea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114163-panacea), [The God Gene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928727-the-god-gene), and [The Void Protocol by F. Paul Wilson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39863281-the-void-protocol) - 4/5 overall. I would categorize this series as a sci-fi thriller with some horror elements, but it was recommended to me in this sub so I thought I would include it in my review. Although the second book dipped in quality slightly, this series overall was a really fun read. If you enjoy Wilson's other works (Repairman Jack series), you'll have a fun time with this.

**Question for the folks who enjoy my reviews**

Any interest in creating a list of things you might want to know about each book? I was thinking I could possibly include things like the Bechdel test, animal abuse, ending on a cliffhanger, other things like that. Is there anything else you would like to see on this list? 

Right now, I track all my books on an excel and I have things like genre, sub genre, publication date as well as information about the author (birthday, gender, birth country etc.), and I really enjoy making visual representations of what I've read through figures and charts. I thought this could be a cool addition, but at the same time I don't want it to be too distracting or messy... What do you all think?

1642692192.0,Call to Arms! I’ve just begun teaching a Horror Lit Semester Unit…,"As the title states, I am a high school English teacher and, after noticing a lack of interest in typical curriculum, decided to go a different route.

The kids LOVE it. We are a few weeks into the unit and I can already see a massive uptick in engagement and interest due to the Horror focus.

That said, I don’t want to be limited in my selections so I need some help! 

The unit is for a senior class, and I was looking for recommendations, particularly short stories, but I will take anything, that might fit into the unit’s breakdown/serve as exemplary works of the various genres. While the students will be learning about the various tenets of Horror fiction in general, the unit will primarily focus on using Horror as a vehicle to examine and practice literary skills/elements. 

It’s structured as follows with a hope for 2-3 short stories and 1 film for each sub-genre.

1. Gothic Horror


2. Folk Horror 


3. Cosmic Horror


4. Sci-Fi Horror

Any help is vastly appreciated!",horrorlit
1642179788.0,"There are 284k members on this sub and after 284k recommendations, I have read Between Two Fires.","And I am happy to say that for me, it lived up to the hype. It helps that this book already has many aspects that were right up my alley to begin with. Things like a medieval setting, fantasy, horror, grittiness, violence, and seeking redemption were always going to make it easy for me to find something to like. But it exceeded my expectations with how beautifully it all came together.

I also liked that it was historical fiction. I am used to reading fantasy/sci-fi with made-up names for places and whatnot. The story being set in a real place amidst a real historical event with a real religion and a real church helped ground the story for me, even with the fantastical elements. This book also gave me strong Berserk(RIP) vibes which is one of my favourite things ever.

Anyhow, thank you to this sub recommending it and I will now take my place alongside the rest of the Between Two Fires recommendation army.

I'm tired of horror stories involving impulsive teens and maladjusted or loner adults stumbling about in ignorance, or where the characterization is subverted by the 'hipness' of the plot.

Question's in the title, I guess. :) It's been a while since I read the original novel, but this has been something I've been pondering for a while since I read a very good thread here about what the best vampire stories might be.

Why exactly does Dracula leave Transylvania for England? Had he stayed home, had he done better research, and so on, he would not have put himself in any danger. Now, it's convenient for the story that he apparently has no self-control and is really bad at planning things out, but for a supposedly villainous mastermind, he's making a lot of really obvious mistakes, along the way.

Now, I know how different movies, games, and comic books rationalize Dracula's behavior. But does Stoker himself actually give us an idea why Dracula decides to move West? Apart from that it makes a for a good story, that is? :)",horrorlit

Last year I started making a list and buying books that were often recommended on here. Read some amazing stories, and could barely get through some others. I was recently put on bedrest due to some unforeseen medical complications and desperately need some more to read. I’m a stay at home and while not being able to get out and do extra work like I could last year, I can’t afford to be hopping on Amazon as often, so I could really use some recommendations tailored to my taste based off of the books I loved and hated, if anyone has the time.

I enjoy books with the paranormal, but my favorites are all psychological horror. This does include things like rape and incest and such, which I know can be a turn off to many. Before making the decision to stay home, I was a therapist for the Department of Corrections and I worked almost exclusively with sex offenders, so that content doesn’t bother me even a little. I find it interesting.

As for the books I disliked, Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last Spoke by Erin LaRocca was genuinely terrible to me. I wanted so bad to like it, but the writing and the story was just atrocious in my opinion. I found Beauregards’ The Slob, Stokoe’s Cows, and Jefferys’ Only the Stains Remain, to just be gratuitous to be honest. I didn’t regret reading Cows I suppose, but I personally wouldn’t choose novels quite as disgusting in the future. I enjoyed Wards’ Last House on Needless Street but wasn’t fond of the ending.

The rest of the books this sub recommended I enjoyed! Some more than others, but all of these were very good to me.

1668871602.0,"Reading my first Stephen King novel ever (Duma Key) and am wondering if this is ""typical"" SK. This is definitely not what I was expecting....","I've seen both IT movies, saw Misery as a child and his screenplay of Storm of the Century is one of my favorite movies of all time. However I never picked up a book by him because they all seemed so massive and intimidating.

I saw a book reviewer on YT recommend this and the cover looked cool to me so I started it last night. I'm only 10% of the way in but......this book isn't ""horror"" to me. I's just incredibly bleak and giving me anxiety which is not what I want when trying to read as an escape. 

The Gandalf part is when I knew I was really in trouble but I tried to rush through that part and pushed on. 

I actually REALLY REALLY enjoy this book and keep picking it back up wanting to know where this is all headed, but I'm just filled with sadness and anxiety because this story could happen to literally anyone. Maybe that's what makes it horror???

I don't know. I was just hoping for a mental escape for a few hours but am now sitting here like OMG this poor man, poor Gandalf. I could become an Edgar one day!

Is there an SK book that any of you could recommend that would be a ""true"" escape from reality for a bit but doesn't have any Gandalf-like scenes and is much more supernatural/not of this world?

1655440956.0,House Of Leaves is phenomenal.,"I just finished it and I am at a loss for words. Never have I read a book this uniquely made and ambitious. The footnotes and references really do make this novel feel real and I love that. It *should of* \[italics for emphasis. you know if you read the book lol\] put me off but it didn't.

Let me get the obvious out of the way: Was this book scary? Scary does not begin to encapsulate it. That word implies in-the-moment jolts and seeing things that make you scream at intervals but once its over you do not feel it. I feel as if this book's scare factor is something that will continue to haunt me long after finishing it. I think I would randomly see scenes from it and be frightened as if I were reading it right that moment. I wouldn't be saying this if it were not for the fact that it happened to me a few times already despite completing the book hours ago. It was not scary in the traditional sense, for me at least, but it was bone-chillingly scary in a very different way. To expand on that, the impending doom, the characters' fear of the unknown and in turn our fear, and most terrifying of all the psychological ramifications of those that foray into the House whether first-hand or through the pages of a badly bundled heap of scrawls and notes is why this book is in a league of its own in terms of horror. At the start of the book we are warned that diving into its contents would be a mistake and as I got deeper and deeper into it and the ever-shifting paradigm of the House, I actually started to kind of regret not heeding that warning as I was having an almost visceral reaction to the events unfolding within it. And that to me is a sign of a f\[ \]cking good book.

The unconventional, labyrinthine (*~~like the labyrinth designed to incarcerate The Minotaur)~~* structure of the book really elevated it to new heights. Like really. Parts of this story have the words placed in a way to mirror a character's experiences in the House and it worked so well. Damn I felt claustrophobic during one scene even and that is thanks to the words lessening as I turned each page.

I would just like to add I LOVED:

\- the Tom chapters. Easily the funniest part of the book. I too would want to to threaten a possibly supernatural house with shit and piss and yell ""Indiscriminate bastard! Doesn't make you sick? It makes me sick. Makes me wanna retch"" if it does nothing.

\-The Whalestoe Institute letters. I really liked the poetic quality to the letters the mother was writing and found the love conveyed in them (addressed to her son) to be wholesome and sweet. Also that encoded letter was a bitch to read but boy was it a good challenge. Also disturbing (I would like to discuss why the mother said what she said if anyone wants to in the comments)

To end off, Danielewski has created a beautiful monster of a book and as Bret Easton Ellis put ""renders most other fiction meaningless"" with whom I am inclined to agree. Its deliciously experimental and inventive and erudite and funny and and and I could say more but I'll end this adjective spluttering here but know that I could very well give you an entire page. Honestly guys, this book was phenomenal and easily the best book I have read this year so far.

*~~don't forget: this is not for you.~~*

The most obvious example of this would be House of Leaves; I know a lot of people didn't enjoy Johnny Truant's interjections, but personally I think they did a great job at creating this vibe. I mean, it probably helped that I just happen to live in a **house** with an abnormally long hallway which is often quite dark at night, but that's neither here nor there.

So, yeah. Can you guys think of any other books that manage to pull this off?

For those that have read this book - I just finished chapter 11 or 12, the part where Delphine, Thomas, and the priest stay with the Woodcarver and his wife in Paris. As the statues knock from door to door getting closer and Mary eventually gets into their house I bet I had a BPM of 120. The description of Annette and Jehan's death was brutal, the visual of the dead baby being thrown around swarmed by flies was unsettling, and Thomas' initial failed attempts at taking the statue down gave me a sinking feeling. Just when you think it's over, as the trio pass the church from which the statues came and are mentally attacked by the statues... it took me a bit to fall asleep last night. I can definitely say I'm a fan of what a good horror novel can do.",horrorlit
1706188225.0,Negative Space by B.R. Yeager is one of the most soul suckingly bleak pieces of fiction I have ever consumed,"I literally just finished this book not mere seconds ago and I don't know how to feel. the book conveys misery in such a perfect and horrific way. it doesn't get mentioned a lot on this sub oddly enough but I think it's true horror. 

the characters are extremely and incredibly tragic and really well written and their descent into madness and despair is really good. 

I don't know, there's just something so perfectly miserable about this whole book and it's not like anything I've ever read or even seen before in fiction. you can feel the pure evil that rises from each page as it creeps into your mind. 

if anyone has any recommendations similar to this book please let me know",horrorlit

1683842268.0,UPDATE: Regarding HOWL Society Book Club and HOWL Society Publishing,"UPDATED WITH u/Lord_Mordi's response at the bottom

Hello everyone,

As many of you now know, the HOWL Society, a book club started on r/HorrorLit and has since grown a publishing arm engaged in an astroturfing campaign to circumvent our community's long established self-promotion rules.

The HOWL Society was created and organized by community member u/Lord_Mordi who also created the HOWL Society publishing that put out several anthologies that our community members were apart of and from which u/Lord_Mordi directly profits from. To promote his (I believe their pronouns are He/Him) company and products, u/Lord_Mordi instructed HOWL Society members to engage in an astroturfing campaign to circumvent our community's self-promotion rules. This was brought to my attention by several HOWL Society community members that have grown uncomfortable with the fading distinction between book club and publishing company that HOWL Society grew into under u/Lord_Mordi's direction. Evidence below:

https://preview.redd.it/botn3uphv9za1.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=d01f6c501ad8c947200357e9020a2533ea695b40

There has been a change of leadership within the HOWL Society book club arm and u/Lord_Mordi is no longer in charge. I did not know this at the time of the astroturfing campaign's discovery but it was in fact the new leadership of the HOWL Society that alerted me to it. I had a long discussion with the new HOWL Society leadership and the Book Club arm and community members remain on good terms with r/HorrorLit. We agreed our conversation should be open to the public and when they post their link within Discord I will edit this post to include that link here.

u/Lord_Mordi and the HOWL Society publishing arm are effective immediately persona non grata on r/HorrorLit. u/Lord_Mordi directly profits from the publishing arm and remains in control of it's finances and operation. Users will still be allowed to recommend works and titles from this publisher but understand you may be under scrutiny if you do now that u/Lord_Mordi has shown he will use underhanded methods to promote his business. It is recommended that community members do not engage in business with u/Lord_Mordi or HOWL Society publishing until he cedes financial and organizational control. However, there are no express rules against doing so if you wish.

This incident comes at an unfortunate time as I was hoping over the summer to overhaul how our self-promotion is handled. I am working on developing a sibling community that would allow amateurs and professionals to share their work, connect with their readers, and connect with publishers. This does not change those plans but just know, for all the authors, editors, and publishers in the community that you are still welcome and we will find a structured way work together.  If you have any ideas or suggestions please contact me or comment below.

If anyone has any questions about this thread, what occurred, and going forward, feel free to comment below or reach out to me personally.

Thank you all for making this the best little spooky place on reddit,

forever at your service,

HIL

The main character was highly unlikeable, she made me root for the killers, but I loved how Hendrix handled her redemption in the final chapters of the story, turning her from untrustworthy coward to brave final girl. 

One thing that naws at me, we never learn Heather's story and what the deal was with the Dream King killer. Why was he named that? What exactly happened? Was this an actual supernatural killer? That was the implicit message I got after Lynnette was horrified at seeing Chrissie's reconstruction of Heather's killer event, the fact he never got captured, and Heather's seeming supernatural ability to locate Lynnette in the nick of time in the climax of the story.

1672589419.0,The 31 horror and dark fiction books I read in 2022,"~~This is the horror/dark fic-only version of the list I posted on~~ /r/books~~\~\~. You can check out the original thread below.\~\~~~ Nevermind, mods of /r/books deleted it, booo.

If you're interested in any of these books, I encouraged you to buy them from your local bookstore. In the meantime, when Reddit starts playing nice, I'll try and update this list with links to BookDepository. Without further ado:

**A Short Stay in Hell**, by Steven L. Peck: A Mormon man dies and discovers there is only one true religion, and it’s not his, so off to hell he goes. Existential horror at its best. I've always been paradoxically afraid of both the idea of eternity and the idea of nothingness, and this book plays with the former and makes me wish for the latter. The most *personally* impacting horror book I've ever read.

**Stonefish**, by Scott R. Jones: In a future wrecked by climate change, a missing, eccentric billionaire discovers the true nature of our reality. It's horrifying and it involves sasquatch diarrhoea and the bodies of wildlife being used for Lovecraftian arts & crafts. Excellent book, equally hilarious and disturbing.

**Between Two Fires**, *by Christopher Buehlman*: [r/horrorlit](https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/) loves this book, I know. Historical horror fantasy about a disgraced knight wandering across a Black Plague-ridden medieval France, to try and save a girl who might or might not be a saint. Darkly beautiful. The hype is very well-deserved. Something about it reminds of Berserk.

**Severance**, *by Ling Ma*: I’m absolutely fucking tired of books about New York, but this was a really good one. A literary spec-fic novel about an epidemic that makes people stuck in their routines until they die and rot. I see it as a sister novel to ‘Station Eleven’. Definitely recommended. Some people found the ending unsatisfying, though.

**Gypsy**, *by Carter Scholz*: A group of intrepid scientists pull an Ocean’s 11 on a billionaire space guy *cough* so they can secretly try to colonise a nearby star system, and perhaps save a lil bit of humankind from climate change. Dark hard sci-fi. This is the best novella I’ve ever read, and one of the best stories overall. If you've ever read Kim Stanley Robinson's brilliant novel **Aurora**, then you'll love this one. (Turns out the authors are friends IRL, too.)

**Wylding Hall**, *by Elizabeth Hand*: A faux documentary novella about a British folk band from the 70s, who holed up in a haunted country house to record a new album. I loved this. I don’t really get scared by books anymore, but the dread in this story was palpable. I got the ebook, but I heard the audiobook is the way to read it. It's got a different narrator for each character.

**Walking to Aldebaran,** *by Adrian Tchaikovsky*: A lost astronaut wanders through a mysterious space station, along with a host of diverse alien creatures who were likewise imprisoned. As I said above, I’m not a big fan of cheeky, snarky prose, so I didn't love this novella as much as I could have. But it is very good, especially on account of the diversity and originality of the alien spaces. The ending is excellent, too.

**Tampa**, *by Alissa Nutting*: An incredibly graphic, disturbing novel about a paedophile female teacher. Powerful, risky art. I honestly don’t know how this novel got published. One of the most affecting novels I read this year.

**The Summer I Died**, *by Ryan C. Thomas*: A splatterpunk novel that’s about two thirds hardcore torture scenes and one third plot and characterisation. Read it if you like extreme horror. I wasn’t a big fan, but I am morbidly curious about the sequels, even if just to see how depraved they can get.

**Entropy in Bloom**, *by Jeremy Robert Johnson*: A brilliant collection of transgressive/weird lit short stories. I'm a big fan of JRJ's **Skullcrack City**, but I find his short fiction to be even stronger. He commits 100% to each premise, no matter how apparently ridiculous. It takes serious talent to make you emotional while reading a story about a dude making a suit out of cockroaches in preparation for a nuclear apocalypse.

**The Only Good Indians**, *by Stephen Graham Jones*: A group of American Indian men commit a cardinal sin when they’re young, and it comes back years later to haunt them in spectacularly horrifying ways. The character work in this novel is truly amazing. Only thing I didn't like was the baffling number of… basketball action scenes? Those were certainly something. Anyway, it’s truly a great book.

**Boy Parts**, *by Eliza Clark*: One of the top GR reviews calls this novel a “hot girl American psycho”. I can see that, if you take away (most) of the extreme violence from American Psycho and keep the hilarious misanthropy. I couldn’t put this book down. Loved it from beginning to end. Unlikeable female protagonists is apparently my jam.

**Amygdalatropolis**, *by B.R Yeager*: The protagonist, /1404er/, is one of many anonymous posters in a 4chan-like dark web forum. His existence is an attempt at self-debasement through chronic consumption of snuff porn, gore videos and live suicides. There is a plot beneath the oncogenic distillation of online horrors, dark poetry and modern nihilism, but honestly this isn't something you read for the plot. Absolutely brilliant.

**Terminal Park**, *by Gary J.Shipley:* Reading this right after Amygdalatropolis really tested the limits of my sanity. The premise is simple: what if everybody started magically multiplying: doppelgangers suddenly bursting out of people, exponentially, until the whole earth is covered in bodies. Just dead bodies, swarms of flies and swarms of birds eating flies, and in turn getting eaten by the flies. Like Amygdalatropolis, this is definitely not a plot-heavy book, more of a philosophical treatise on all the filters and screens we absorb life through. How everything is a simulacrum of a simulacrum. On par with Amygdalatropolis, one of the most grotesquely beautiful books I’ve ever read. Not an easy rec, though. Read if you're into philosophy and don't mind plotless stories.

**Last Days**, *by Brian Evenson*: A detective who got his hand chopped off by a maniac is kidnapped by a cult who believes amputation brings you closer to god, and then forced to investigate a murder. This was my introduction to Brian Evenson, who instantly became of my favourite writers. His style evokes a sense of abstract unease like nothing else.

**Woom**, *by Duncan Ralson*: A man hires a prostitute and tells her a bunch of stories that can’t possibly be real. An extreme horror novel written in a mosaic of shorts. It’s got substance, which seems to be rare in extreme horror. I liked it, but didn’t love it. Cool ending, though.

**Scorch Atlas**, *by Blake Butler*: Another weird philosophical horror book like Amygdalatropolis and Terminal Park. Unlike the other two, though, I found it unnecessarily obfuscatory. It’s a shame, because the prose is gorgeous and the premises of the stories – a collection of interconnected weird apocalypses – are fascinating. I might give it another try.

It does have one of the most beautiful passages I’ve ever read: *“You could probably fit a billion woes in every day depending on how small you sliced the hour.”*

**Animals Eat Each Other**, *by Elle Nash*: Not a big fan. I went in with the wrong expectations. I'd been told this was a very disturbing novel, but it’s just an okay drama about toxic relationships. Read **Boy Parts** instead of this one. Good prose and character work, though.

**Scanlines**, *by Todd Keisling*: One night, instead of watching porn like normal people, a couple teens end up downloading the video of a politician killing himself on live TV\*. Soon after, they begin to see the dead guy everywhere. In their dreams, in other people’s faces… And then the suicidal ideation sets in. I really dug this one.

\*Based on the real-life televised suicide of American politician R. Budd Dwyer. I watched the real video when I was a kid and I recommend you don’t.

**Dwellers**, *by Eliza Victoria*: The story of two young men who have the ability of taking over people’s bodies, and it turns out their latest hosts are hiding a dark secret, namely a dead body in the basement. Lots more heart in this than I expected. A fabulous little novella set in the Philippines. I think it’s out of print now, but it will be republished soon.

**White and Other Tales of Ruin,** *by Tim Lebbon*: A collection of novellas with apocalyptic themes. I loved the titular one, but the others not so much. Like **The Year in a Linear City**, there’re some egregious cases of ‘men writing women’ here. At a certain point, a dude is desperately trying to save his daughter from drowning but takes a second to get horny at the sight of a woman’s breasts. Bruh. That stuff aside, it’s okay, but I rec you just read the first novella if you can find it somewhere.

**The Indifferent Stars Above,** *by Daniel James Brown*: Non-fic book about the Donner Party, a group of pioneers who got stuck in the Sierra Nevada mountains and had to resort to fun stuff like cannibalism in order to survive. An enthralling read, honestly reads like horror fiction.

**The Troop,** by Nick Cutter: A bunch of boy scouts and their scoutmaster go on a trip into the Canadian wilderness, and find a virus that makes you voraciously, horrifyingly hungry. Like eat rocks and break your teeth hungry. It’s a bit overhyped by [r/horrorlit](https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/), but definitely a good read. Great body horror and character work that reminds me of OG Stephen King.

**Sangue Novo (New Blood)**, *various authors*: A Portuguese anthology of short horror fiction written by the students of a horror writing workshop. For a country with barely any horror literature this was surprisingly good. I’ve half a mind to translate some of the shorts myself, namely one about a mental asylum dedicated to mothers overly attached to their sons. Definitely recommended if you can read Portuguese. (You can probably get by if you speak Spanish.)

**As Sombras de Lázaro (The Shadows of Lazarus),** *by Pedro Lucas Martins*: The author is the instructor of the aforementioned workshop, and this is his long form debut. It’s a gothic horror story about a man who was committed to a mental asylum for two years, following a tragic mistake. Now he returns to a wife and son who barely recognise him, to find that his secret has followed him home in the form of three paintings depicting inhuman figures, who might or might not be alive. I liked it a lot. It’s a cross of old-school gothic and Shirley Jackson.

**The Twenty Days of Turin,** *by Giorgio di Maria*: An Italian horror novel in which the city of Turin is being assailed by Lovecraftian-ish creatures who’re using people as literal cudgels to beat each other up and settle nonsensical arguments. It’s just brilliant. This was written in the 70s yet predicted social media to a tee. One of the best books I’ve ever read. I’m so glad it got translated. I often wonder how many legendary books we're missing just because they haven't been translated into English.

**The Immeasurable Corpse of Nature**, *by Christopher Slatsky*: Ligottian short fiction with a heart, dealing with themes of grief, disfranchisement and ontological depression. I bought this on a whim because I liked the title and cover, and I'm so glad I did. Devastatingly beautiful.

**Dead Inside**, *by Chandler Morrison*: A dude who likes to fuck corpses meets a girl who likes to eat dead babies. Wasn’t a fan. It’s possible the whole thing is satirical and it just flew over my head, but I just found this cringeworthy. Not because of the content, but because the protagonist is the most annoying edgelord in existence. Necrophilia is the least of his sins, tbh.

**Fugue State**, *by Brian Evenson*: A much needed palate cleanser after Dead Inside. A collection of surreal, literary weird fiction. This isn’t an easy rec because Brian Evenson has a very sui generis style, darkly comic and ethereal in a way that might not be for everybody, but to me the man is incapable of writing a bad story. Loved it.

**Penpal,** *by Dathan Auerbach*: A man reminisces on seemingly unconnected episodes of his life which led to a horrifying outcome. I don’t quite know how to feel about this one. There’s a lot to like here, but the prose needed more polishing. Not because it’s bad, but because it doesn’t quite fit the tone of the story. This reads like a great [r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/) post turned into a good book.

**Negative Space,** *by B.R Yeager*: By the author of Amygdalatropolis, another story about toxic internet culture as a gateway to the debasement of the self, in which a bunch of kids start using an hallucinogenic drug to cope with a suicide pandemic. Gorgeous prose, great characters, perfect atmosphere. B.R Yeager is a one in a lifetime talent. The perfect book to end the year.

I loved Annihilation, and that sense of weirdness in a place full of strange incomprehensible happenings.

+ Plus for a small creepy remote town, disorientating forests, or some unexplainable force with a sense of doom. That sort of thing...

I know there's plenty of fantasy/dark fantasy monster hunting stories but I'm looking for something more decidedly gothic horror. I've just finished my umpteenth playthrough and need more, damn it!

Bonus points for: 

- Victorian era

- takes place in urban settings

- oppressive almost mid/post apocalyptic atmosphere

- cosmic horror backdrop

- presence of monsters/beasts

- strong emphasis on horror


Edit: I also love the obtuse, fragmented style of worldbuilding/storytelling in From's games but this might not be feasible for a novel.",horrorlit

1602252149.0,"""The Only Good Indians"" and ""My Sister, The Serial Killer""","I finished ""The Only Good Indians"" last night and loved it. It was unique and lyrical. I am loving that folk horror is having a moment. I think the imagery from this one will stay with me for a while.

I immediately started ""My Sister, The Serial Killer"" and stayed up until 3am to finish it. That was another one that was different. I'm not really sure I would even classify that one as a horror, but that's what it's listed as. I couldn't put it down so luckily it's a quick read. I loved the unique perspective and that it takes place in Nigeria within a different culture. It's surprisingly layered while being disguised as a slasher.

Next up is either ""The Boatman's Daughter"" or Margaret Atwood's ""The Testaments"".",horrorlit

1659132708.0,Revival by Stephen King,"**FINAL GRADE: 5/5**

I have been reading Stephen King since I was 12 years old and there isn't a lot left to discover in his cannon outside the new releases. However, his 2014 novel *Revival* came along and rocked my world. It's said that you can't teach an old dog new tricks but King finds a new way to explore the themes that have rippled throughout his work: addiction, faith, coming of age. What I love so much is that he lets himself slow down. Sure, I can picture a punchier version that resembles a novella or short story, but the power of the narrative comes from how much time we spend with the main character. We're able to see Jamie at highs and lows, to notice patterns that draw out the themes of destiny and how much control we have of our own life. 

A part of me wishes that the novel didn't begin with a quote from Lovecraft as King teases out the otherworldly elements in such a way that you could miss them. It's obviously an homage to works such as Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* and Arthur Machen's *The Great God Pan* but the real trick is blending the elements of weird fiction together. And yes, the ending completely delivers even down to the final line.",horrorlit

Here are the actual books, in order, that I read, with a few comments on each. I do plan on expanding this out and doing a fuller review of each.

1.	A Cosmology of Monsters by Shaun Hamill. This was well put together, with interesting characters, but ultimately did not really do it for me.

2.	The Invited by Jennifer McMahon. I thought it was a good read. This was the second book of hers that I’ve read, and I plan on seeking more out.

3.	The Last Astronaut by David Wellington. The concept was interesting, but the overall book did not really hook me.

4.	Ararat by Christopher Golden. Fun little action read, but not great.

5.	The Lesser Dead by Christopher Buehlman. My second Buehlman, after Those Across the River. The man can write. I was a big fan of this one. 

6.	Inspection by Josh Malerman. Had a big Stephen King vibe here. Fun read, but not fantastic.

7.	The Boatman’s Daughter by Andy Davidson. Hell of a good book. Scratched my horror and southern gothic itches. Will be reading anything else he puts out, and hitting up his first one shortly.

8.	Suffer the Children by Craig Delouie. It was a quick read, but did not really stand out for me.

9.	The Immaculate Void by Brian Hodge. Highly recommended.

10.	Certain Dark Things by Silvia Moreno-Garcia. I had problems with this book, in that the author put out a good story, but the world building did not really seem necessary to the story itself. I enjoyed the read but felt let down at the end. 

11.	Kill Creek by Scott Thomas. I was hooked on this one. Loved the prose, the characters. Lots of fun.

12.	The Family Plot by Cherie Priest. Not a bad thing to say about this one. Very solid.

13.	The Fold by Peter Clines. More sci-fi than horror, I’d already read the first in the series, and I’ll be reading the rest. Definitely a fun read.

14.	The Chill by Scott Carson. Interesting book, but a bit of a slog. 

15.	The Sun Down Motel by Simone St. James. More mystery than horror, but there were moments I was creeped out. Recommended.

16.	The Deep by Alma Katsu. The Hunger would be a tough book to top. This was definitely good, the writing and the characters were well done. 

17.	Violet by Scott Thomas. I dug this one. Definitely going to be keeping an eye out for this writer.

18.	We Sold Our Souls by Grady Hendrix. First Hendrix of the year. Lots of fun, damn near required reading for metal fans.

19.	The Light at the End by John Skipp and Craig Spector. Hell of a good read. Old school, grimy New York, great, vivid characters.

20.	The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires by Grady Hendrix. This was just a fun read. Yeah, I’m a Hendrix fanboy.

21.	American Elsewhere by Robert Jackson Bennett. Been wanting to read this for a while, and it did not disappoint. It’s a big read of a book, shades of horror. I’ve got a couple more of his in the pipeline.

22.	The Wise Friend by Ramsey Campbell. My first Campbell. It won’t be the last. When I haunt used book stores he’s a name I look out for.

23.	The Broken Girls by Simone St. James. More a mystery and ghost story, but a fun read.

24.	Lake of Darkness by Scott Kenemore. Damn good book. 

25.	Horrorstor by Grady Hendrix. Very fun read here.

26.	Fevre Dream by George R. R. Martin. This was a solid damn book. I highly recommend it.

27.	The Last Days of Jack Sparks by Jason Arnopp. Perhaps gimmicky, but I really liked how it was put together.

28.	Remains by Andrew Cull. Incredibly bleak, but very well written.

29.	Mongrels by Stephen Graham Jones. Been a SGJ fan for years at this point, and had this since it was released but only now got to it. Not really horror, no, but the werewolf skin over the coming of age in poverty tale was damn beautiful.

30.	The Elementals by Michael McDowell. Heard a lot of good things about this book. It did not disappoint.

31.	Night Film by Marisha Pessl. Not my cup of tea.

32.	Devolution by Max Brooks. Definitely a fun read, but I would say it wasn’t the greatest follow up there could have been to World War Z. 

33.	The Patient by Jasper Dewitt. I was not a fan of this book.

34.	Devil’s Creek by Todd Keisling. I did enjoy this a good bit. The backwoods religion and cosmic horror was a fun combination.

35.	The Toll by Cherie Priest. Definitely a fun piece of southern gothic.

36.	Wonderland by Zoje Stage. This was well written, but did not hook me. Felt similar to 

37.	Survivor Song by Paul Tremblay. Horror, no. Did I know where it was going, yeah. But, man, that was a good trip. I’m a fan of Tremblay for a while, his old PI novels, and this just feels like someone coming into their own.

38.	The Suicide Motor Club by Christopher Buehlman. Second Buehlman of the year, second of his vampire novels. I loved what he did here. Definitely recommended. Before the year is out I’ll be reading his other two books. 

39.	Coldbrook by Tim Lebbon. I enjoyed it. Long read, maybe a bit too big for it’s britches, but it was a lot of fun.

40.	The Living Dead by George A. Romero and Daniel Kraus. Probably the most emotional I got with books this year. I’ve got a long personal history with Romero, and it was great to finally get to read this. I would have loved to see where this would have gone if he was able to finish it himself, but overall, it was a lot of fun, and had a ton of heart.",horrorlit

1590653845.0,"Disturbing Books I’ve read, and Ratings","This obsession started with Covid-19, and has been a good way to pass the time. I’ve gleefully selected these books and devoured them in long sittings, gobbling away at the text. It’s not a long list, but I hope you’ll read and find books that you’ve read that are similar to recommend. It’s an addiction! Most of the books listed are found on scribd or online


Cows (by Mathew Stokoe) (10/10) - This one I had to purchase due to it’s rarity. I went into this book with very little context and was delighted. It’s only slightly less revolting as the previous read. There are no happy endings and it’s just a generally funny little book. Definitely on the deep end. It’s a rising to power story for the under... cow. Hm. Still, I enjoyed this read through and through and have gone back to re-read.
(Contains - Rape, Gore, Scat, Orgies, Beastality, General Depravity)

Guts (by Chuck Palahniuk) (9/10) - Yeeeuck! This read was difficult for me. Despite the two books above being objectively worse, I found myself sick after this one. I felt my stomach lurch at this short story, and I couldn’t find myself forgetting it in days afterwards. I recommend this over the whole “Haunted” story, due to it’s odd style. I tried reading it and found myself rather bored. 
(Contains - Crude content, and Gore) 

The Long Walk (by Stephen King) (10/10) - This is the first one I wouldn’t give a rated R rating to. I’m found of this one, because it’s the perfect idea of a psychological thriller. 100 boys set off one day, and they just can’t stop walking. Picked off one by one. It doesn’t get more psychologically destructive than that! I delighted in watching the group thin out, and the remainder unravel.
(Contains - Death)

Unwind Series (by Neal Shusterman) (10/10) - I. Love. This. Series. Firstly, a good horror book is a delight. One that leads to 3 more, AND Add-On Stories? Neal really knows how to spoil a girl. It’s not terrifying, but it’s a good young adult novel meets horror series. Imagine if parents could just get their kids taken apart if they wanted to, until they were 18? The moment your parent signs the Unwind Documents, your timer started. How long could you run? There are some really bone-chilling descriptions as the narrative changes. One scene from Book one, I’ll carry at the back of my brain in honor of the horrors that take place.

Suffer The Children (by Craig Dilouie) (6/10) - This one is alright. I enjoyed it well enough. I was disappointed I couldn’t find the more deprived book by the same name (by a John Saul) but settled on this one. Vampire children and desperate parents. It’s a cool read and all but I just found it to disappoint me. They divulge details here and restrain there. Might as well show your reader everything, in my opinion.

The Wasp Factory (5/10) - I didn’t enjoy this one. It was boring, you get the same buzz from the wikipedia as you do leafing through the pages. Great imagery, but not executed quickly. Didn’t enjoy the pacing. 

Johnny got his Gun (6/10) - Great premise, and a decent read. However, If you get bored by characters switching back and forth from current day to memories that don’t really pertain, you’ll get bored. It’s the only thing this poor protagonist can do in his position, but it’s still kinda dull. I digress, a great anti-war read. I still recommend it.

I Have No Mouth, But I Must Scream (10/10) - Delightful short story!! I tried to read the other ones of this series and found myself a little bored. I like this one for no good reason, check it out! The title was enough to intrigue me, and it lives up to it.

Sade Smols (9/10) - This is a great short story, and the sequel is decent as well. However, with how people spoke about it, I felt it was underwhelming. Go in with no pretenses. You’ll enjoy this horrific quickie much more. 

that’s all I have for now - I’ll try and add more in the future! Recommend more for me to read!",horrorlit

""The Jaunt"" by Stephen King and the fate of the son having gone through it awake and experienced eternity in a whitespace void, has always stuck with me as a fate worse than death. Even more terrifying, is the sub-story of the woman whose husband pushed her through a Jaunt without an end gate (resulting in truly permanent immortal eternity in a whitespace void).

All I will say is Wow. What an incredible ride. Not only is this book legitimate Horror -complete w/ several scenes that will genuinely scare you- but it is Beautifully written! I would even call the prose Elegant. It's just so wonderfully written. 

I read this over 4 nights, and felt a myriad of emotions. Some of it was funny, and yes some was truly scary. But the thing I felt the most was this sense of .... wrongness. Almost like I was privy to something I shouldn't be seeing. In a way it almost felt like I was in violation of some one or something ... which I realized is probably intentional on the authors part because physical and emotional violation in all its many forms is very much a theme. 

If you are on the fence: READ THIS! . Yes it is effing Intense. Yes the first 1/3 is a bit slow as the tension grows. But my God this book is so legit.

Richard Laymon is funny, weird and gross, but not too scary. I'm bored by Nick Cutter. Stephen King has a lot of good ideas, but rarely brings them to a satisfying conclusion. Jack Ketchum is nasty and disgusting, but is more stressful than scary.

I'm sure this won't be the case for everyone who reads it, but I just read a chapter in Last Days where the main characters are shooting some documentary footage at night in an empty house where a mysterious cult lived decades before.

They're shooting in the basement when they hear what might be footsteps upstairs. They figure it's their imagination and shoot some more footage in the top floor and then hear someone *running* down the hall. Then they flee in terror. When one of the characters watches the footage the next day, he realizes they caught an emaciated, pale figure pursuing them. For some reason this scene really got to me. I was in bed in the dark and kept expecting a creepy face to appear next to me or something...

1616717899.0,"Finished reading ""I'm thinking of ending things"" last night ...","**AND I COULDN'T SLEEP FOR HALF THE NIGHT**, as I laid there wondering what the fuck did I just read. Ending spoilers ahead so watch out.

Most of the book was frustrating for me. Constant monologue where the main character just keeps switching between ""I'm so letting him go!"" to ""OR AM I?!"" every chapter. It had clever dialogues here and there plus a fair bit of unsettling set-up with the caller and Jake/other characters acting weird, yet still it felt like a drag to get through.

**AND THEN THINGS ENDED**, and it shocked me to my core. Not only it was the first time I've finished a book without understanding what the hell just happened, but also got a hint from the author that I should read it back to piece things together. I was curious, I was furious, and most of all; I was intrigued. 

**THERE IS BUT ONE QUESTION**. Is there an answer to all this? Some googling later and I notice that there are no obvious answers. There are different theories, yet nothing that would convince me ""oh, so this is what must've happened!"".

So I'd like to hear some opinions of the fellow readers of this book. From what I've assumed, the *actual* storyline went more or less like this:

*Jake was an isolated janitor working at a local school. Despite being clever, he had untreated mental problems (likely schizoprenia?), that escalated as he grew older. At some point of his past, he met a woman at a pub who he could imagine being his girlfriend, but afraid of the commitment, he didn't exchange phone numbers and ended up harboring massive self-guilt. He started imagining a separate reality, in which the woman did become his girlfriend. The idea that she could actually love him and want to stay with him, was the chain that kept him from the decision of committing suicide. This illusion eventually started crumbling, as the imagined lady visitted his family home. Jake's insecurities started surfacing as his parents' characters showed signs of worry and hinted at Jake's health problems. The two characters (younger Jake and the woman) started melding together into a stressed, insecure persona of the actual older Jake. Eventually, the two characters end up in school, and as the dream keeps collapsing due to increased mental strain, eventually Jake ""comes together"" with the alter-egos he created, at long last getting the answer to his one question, ""Should I end things?"".*

I believe he's had schizoprenia due to the fact that he couldn't control the alter-egos and side characters of the story. They weren't some sort of romanticised versions of themselves. They kept thoughts from each other, and acted as if they were separate entities. Hence the story being so convincing rather than seemingly being a tale of a lunatic. 

**NOW I'M NOT SURE** where to place his ""brother"" and the ""caller"" characters. Did they actually exist? And what was the idea behind the mysterious girl from the photo that Jake claimed was his brother's girlfriend? Why even have that whole ""mentally ill brother"" swap at the end there? 

**NOW HERE I SIT WONDERING** if I can call this book a boring read, if in the end, it provoked my brain to think so much about it afterwards. I suppose it's one of these rare cases, where it's worth suffering for hours on end, only to reach a conclusion that filps the script entirely, and turns the story into much more. In retrospect, the book *has a valid reason* for being a boring, chaotic mess at times, as we're basically reading the thoughts of a mentally ill person, and I find that entire setup quite fascinating. 

Share your thoughts/theories! Especially if you think you have answers to some of the questions that are troubling me above. Meanwhile I'm off to watch the movie, as I'm super curious how they had handled the vague clues and mental degeneration in the story.",horrorlit
1615050979.0,The Deep was fantastic (no spoilers),"I was hesitant to read this because of the mixed opinions I have seen on this sub. I decided to give it a go considering the opinions on Cutter's *The Troop* are also very mixed on here, and that is a book that I love wholeheartedly.

Without going in to too many details, I feel like I can state for a fact that no one does body horror quite like Nick Cutter. His ability to intrigue and disgust simultaneously is truly something to behold, and this ability is bolstered massively by the isolated and claustrophobic setting.

There are some parts in the middle of the book that I felt dragged a bit, but those bits weren't enough to stifle my enjoyment in any serious way.

I liked the characters, I liked the central mystery, and I loved how everything concluded. There are moments in this book that will stick with me for a long time, and what else can you really ask for from horror fiction?

1684628194.0,Duma Key is the best King book of the 21st Century...if not his outright best,"I read Stephen King's *Duma Key* during my first week of college and the memories of lugging around that heavy hardback around campus will always hold a special space in my heart. And a few hours ago I just got done listening to the audiobook, narrated masterfully by John Slattery, and still find the book to be King's best attempt at being a ""literary"" author. Don't get me wrong, King has constantly proven himself to be more than a horror writer but often when he tries dust off that image with books like *The Green Mile* or *Bag of Bones*(which is still horror but was a blatant attempt at being a high fluent horror writer), I find the results less than stellar. The Kingisms persistently feel out of place and like he's trying to be something that he's not. 

But *Duma Key* is completely different. For one, it's not really a horror novel. I'd consider it more in the realm of a gothic in terms of setting; I don't think the prose really attempt a gothic style. However, in a broader sense, King is doing a fairly straight drama. Yes, the supernatural is there although I don't believe it to be the center. The center is Edgar and the character in his orbit. He represents a kind of artist I wish we saw more in fiction. He didn't study the art of painting or is even that knowledgable about it. The choices he makes with the brush are more from a sense pure creation than technique. Out of all the King creatives, which mostly consists of writers, I find Edgar to be the most unique. And I love the troop Edgar builds around him. The relationship between Edgar and Jerome touching. 

I really the mystery and how King interweaves it into the present narrative. Similar to Derry or Castle Rock, the titular location is incredibly rich and makes you Google ""is Duma Key real?"" Not unlike the gothic, the location enhances the characters and mystery. There is a real sense of history. I love all the mythos and brining in real figures like Dali. 

*Duma Key* is an honest book. There is something tangibly tender about King's prose and storytelling. oddly enough, I'd compare the character work he does in *It* in crafting multidimensional and compelling people. I no complaints. This is a masterpiece.",horrorlit
1635224273.0,I just finished Tender Is The Flesh,"People warned me about the ending. I was warned. I braced myself for the absolute worst and still managed to get fucking blind-sided by the last 2 pages. 

I'll say that what I'm about to write will contain spoilers, so there's that. 

I think Marcos was used to represent humanity's hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance, or the act of simultaneously believing two completely contradictory thoughts. 

In the first half of the book, Marcos sort of indirectly portrays himself as morally superior to those around him, disgusted by the idea that they see ""head"" as animals instead of people. He, over and over again, expresses disgust and cynicism towards these people who have fully adapted to the Transition and accept that this is life now. 

He appears jaded and cynical, but in the context he provides, his cynicism actually comes off as warranted and righteous. In the first half of the book, his anger and disgust comes from a place of him choosing to maintain his moral convictions in spite of the constant atrocities he's surrounded with. 

He claims he refuses to accept them as animals, that he doesn't eat the meat and hates what's happening to them and only goes along with it because he has no choice. 

Then, he takes in Jasmine, and the cracks start to show. 

The first thing he did that hinted at his hypocrisy to me was a statement he made about watching her on the cameras. Something along the lines of ""Sometimes she stares, fixated on some point on the walls. Looking like she's thinking, almost as if she could.""

When I read that line, it made me question and reflect on his other actions, and I noticed a few more things. 

He doesn't indirectly say that Jasmine has the mental capacity of a small child, but his actions and descriptions of her make it clear time and time again that this is how he views her. 

So, Marcos, who holds a sense of self-righteous over his refusal to embrace atrocity, is also willing to repeatedly have sex with a toddler-like woman who he says he believes is incapable of complex thought. 

Okay dude, step off your high horse. 

Then I noticed something else:

The only empathetic things he ever does for her, after his first time having sex with her (""raping her"" if you will, because by his own description of her, she is incapable of consenting to sex), serve two purposes: 

- to keep her from harming herself 
- to keep her from destroying his house

Those are the only things he ever does. Keep her from maiming/killing herself, and keeping her obedient and occupied so she doesn't make a mess. 

When I noticed this, it clicked with me that he doesn't really view her as a human, the way he claims to. 

Then he confronts his sister about her treatment of her ""head"", only to kill Jasmine the moment she becomes more inconvenient than valuable, literally several hours later. 

And then the truth really honed in on me: he never truly believed the things he claimed to. He convinced himself that he believed them, because they allowed him the ability to view himself as better than those around him who view heads as animals. But the very moment those beliefs stopped serving in his favor, he literally immediately threw them away. 

Marcos, who I sincerely empathized with for the first half of the book, was a relatively immoral hypocrite who did whatever mental gymnastics it took to convince himself he was a good person. 

But then again, aren't most of us the same way? 

Marcos was a lot of things. Most of them bad. But at the end of the day, in my opinion, he was a harsh, truthful, brutal mirror of how each of us views the unpleasant realities surrounding us.

""Yes, the conditions of our world are atrocious, but I'm not a bad person for contributing to it, I don't have a choice, and if I did, I'd choose differently."" 

Marcos is the total summation of all the lies we, as people, tell ourselves to be okay with how we live and how we allow the world to be.",horrorlit

It’s a very unique book and one I’ll remember for many years to come.

I give “The Last House on Needless Street” a 4/5 as it is an excellent psychological horror involving murder, serial killers, and survival to the highest degree in a cruel world. This novel was hard to put down and ended up being an instant page-turner. The ending was alright and even though I wanted a bit more, I'm looking forward to reading her next novel, ""Sundial"" by the end of March :-)",horrorlit

1616436959.0,Question RE sex scenes in older horror novels Early 90s and before.,"First of all, spoiler for IT.

So, everyone knows about the infamous 12-year-old sex scene in IT. Thing is I was reading horror novels at a pretty young age and I seem to remember that type of thing being: 1) pretty common and 2) often weirdly shoehorned in.

I specifically remember reading this one book that was about a bunch of young kids fighting vampires. So 2/3 in the main characters go to a kids b-day party and out of nowhere these two young kids not more that 14 bang on the couch in the garage. Right after it's back to vampires but it comes out of nowhere and is quite explicit. 

My question to older prolific horror novel readers. Back in the 70s and 80s was there an expectation from the publishers that authors include almost pornographic sex scenes? Was it just a trend that authors copied off each other? Am I just seeing a trend that wasn't there? Pure curiosity. but I've always wondered.",horrorlit
1606501233.0,The Ruins by Scott Smith,"This book gets recommended to death on this sub and rightfully so. It's one of the best horror books I've read this year. It was so easy to relate to the characters, you could find yourself rooting for someone in one chapter and hating them the next, and it was all natural. The fact that the antagonist was something ineffable and inevitable really set the tone and had me in the feeling of dread the entire time. And damn, what an ending. It was a gut punch.

I wanted to talk about one scene in particular that really impacted me. 

Spoilers below!!

>!That fight between Jeff and Amy was astounding. I could just picture myself in Jeff's shoes; wanting to be the one who was apologized to for once instead of always apologizing, finally standing up and not going to comfort, feeling absolutely torn because every part of me wants to comfort Amy but there's just *something* that prevents me from doing it.!<

>!I could feel Amy's despair and dread. Her bone-weariness. The last thing she wanted was to fight with Jeff. She was so tired of being bossed around, especially after having gone through such a grueling ordeal.!<

>!And then she was killed! And all Jeff could think about was, if he had just comforted her, he could have saved her life. If he had just listened to every screaming instinct in his body, Amy would still be alive. Jeff completely and utterly blamed himself for what happened and it all could have been prevented with a couple of steps and a hand on Amy's shoulder...!<

I reread that scene 3 or 4 times just digesting what the hell happened. I think it was so well done because so many of us have been in Jeff's situation where we know we should be comforting someone, regardless of who was right and who was wrong, but we don't. And a deep inner fear is that one day we might do it again and face the same consequences Jeff faced.",horrorlit

1602816044.0,The deep by Nick Cutter was freakin' great !,"I thought the troop was good but this is wayyyy better or at least more my cup of tea.

This book is an homage to cosmic horror and I love it. It doesn't reinvent the wheel but it is so well crafted that it get my thumb up.

Nick Cutter is very good at describing a scene in words that will make you squirm in your chair.

Read if you like: undescribable monstrosity older than time, mental brake down, deep sea diving, tattooed boat propeller on asses and clowns.

Don't read if you don't like: horrible parents (trust me I'm being kind here), Bee's (not the bee's), lab animal (dogs in general) and people/things not being nice to them, insects and claustrophobia.

***Spoiler ahead***

The only thing I can say I hated about the books was how some of the plots points were sooooo unescessary. The ""gets"" ? Why did the author need that for the plot to get going, just say some rich dude found a way to cure cancer or something. That would have made  the ending so much worse. I mean, the world is ending and the planet is dying, I guess we'll die... more ? The author also shit so much on the main character, you could cut half of what happened to him at the start of the book and it would be fine. I dunno I just feel like Luke has probably the worst luck in the history of mankind. 

I don't like ending that end badly in general but that's my preference. It's par for the course with Cutter and I accept it.",horrorlit
1571356752.0,Horns by Joe Hill was incredible,"Tried NOS4A2 and Lock & Key and wasn't really a fan, but I picked Horns up on a whin and absolutely loved it.

Everything about the book clicked with me (maybe more so than most because I had a religious background growing up). Ig, Merrin, and Lee were all wonderfully written, unique in their own rights and no bullshit. One of my favorite thing about King is how dirty and real he writes his characters, and maybe just because I know Hill is his son I can't help but make this comparison, but the characters in Horns gave me the same feeling as King in his best. Lee was deplorable, and yet understandably so. Ig and Merrin were good people but heavily flawed; their childhood love story and what it's like growing up with the same people was really well written.

The fantasy aspect - the horns and the Treehouse of the Mind - were so refreshing. I think the thing I loved most about this book was how the horns made all the characters tell Ig surface impulses. It led to many dark yet utterly hilarious confessions, and many all too real confession. The book really makes you wonder what the people closest to you are thinking deep down - things they will never say, but that we all feel. Once I saw the direction the whole Devil thing was going I was afraid it would get heavy-handed, but I found it was just the right amount, and I loved the powers Ig had. 

Lee was probably the best (and the worst) thing about the book imo. I am not a fan of reading about nasty characters - it gives me really bad reading induced stress - but although Lee was truly a vile human being, his character was really fascinating because he felt all too real, and not someone who was just evil for evil's sake. He was really interesting to read about; his thoughts, how he became what he was, why he does what he does. 

Another one of the book's strongest aspects is the pacing. At 350-400 pages (depending on the copy) I found it to be the perfect length. Once I got to my first flashback chapter I was really worried. I was enjoying the the ride of the power of the Horns and didn't want a childhood backstory, but not only was backstory necessary, it came at just the right time, and throughout the book the transition from past to present was paced as well as I could imagine. I found the ending to be a bit lacking, but not so much so to put a sour taste in my mouth.

Let me know what you think about the book! Also, I'm wondering what I should read next by Hill - The Fireman or Heart Shaped Box. Any fans of him please lead me in the right direction :D",horrorlit

1618412195.0,“Reimagining” the works of women in horror,"So, I’m sitting in this bookstore and of course I go straight for the horror section. While there, I see Koontz came out with an entire series “reimagining” the story of Victor Frankenstein.

As I skim through the pages, I see no mention of or credit given to Mary Shelley. This got me thinking of Shirley Jackson, and how one of her masterpieces was just recently reimagined by a fabulous director/creator. I love Mike Flanagan, but for someone who tries so hard to stick to the original storyline for King adaptions and do them justice, he completely obliterated the story of Hill House. I will say I thought series was phenomenal, but I couldn’t help thinking that he might as well have just changed the names and location of the story if he was merely inspired by HOHH. The only thing remotely similar to this legendary story are the characters’ names.

And to top that off, they named the absolute worst character Shirley. All while putting the words of Jackson in the brother’s mouth, to which he ROLLS HIS EYES AT when read aloud by a fan. What in the actual hell?!

Am I the only one confused as to why we cannot leave these legendary authors’ works alone? Why does every woman in horror have to have her most chilling tales constantly reimagined by guys who can’t take an extra minute to just come up with an idea all their own?
I’m glad they’re inspired, but If I were one of these women I’d tell these men where to stick their reimagining. I mean, I’m a die hard King fan but I’ll be damned if the movie The Shining strayed too far from the book. How would we have felt if Kubrick completely changed every aspect the story?

End of rant. Thank you for listening.",horrorlit
1612106126.0,Head Full of Ghosts and Trauma,"Since the end of September, I’ve been binging different literary horror/disturbing fiction books. I’ve read 23 books so far and have loved pretty much everything I’ve read. 

I was making really good progress but once I finished Head Full of Ghosts, I lost my momentum. That book seriously messed me up and I can’t stop thinking about it. Some spoilers ahead for the book. 

A huge reason for the effect this book had is how I was able to identify with the narrator. I am a younger sister and when I was very young, my sister was in a really traumatic car accident. She survived but is a non-verbal quadriplegic and is nowhere near the person I knew her to be before her accident.

Some lines in this book fell on me like a ton of bricks and watching the way trauma changes a whole family was incredibly resonant. 

I don’t know anyone personally who has read this book and just feel like I need to talk about it. I also felt Tremblay was masterful in his allusions - enough so that the way in which the ultimate demise of all family member except the narrator was predictable but also satisfying. 

I also felt a similar feeling when reading We Have Always Lived in the Castle, from which Tremblay pulls a lot. The way the uncle in WHALitC fixates on trying to entirely recount the exact details of the trauma - that feels so authentic to how some deal with trauma.

I think Head Full of Ghosts seems like a possession/supernatural story but the real horror and tension is watching trauma encompass this family.",horrorlit

1593273768.0,Rec Request: Horror books that do not involve children and/or sexual depravity,"To give some context: I couldn't finish *The Girl Next Door* by Ketchum.  I got through a good chunk but once the real chaos started I couldn't take it.  Reading through the rest of the plot summary, I am glad I didn't.  I do understand why that book is up there in a lot of people's quintessential horror lists but for me there is isn't much entertainment value in reading a book like that.  The dark and depraved path that it goes down leaves me just depressed and angry.  I think a big part of that has to do with the book being centered around a child's perspective.  I will say if you are in the market for feeling truly unsettled, the book does the job and is well written.

Anyway back to my original question: I was hoping this subreddit could bring me back to some ""more wholesome"" chilling stories (outside of horrorlit's top books) that don't involve children or messed up sexual exploits.  I've had my share of that for a while through this book alone.  I don't want to lead any answers on with books that I've already enjoyed, I'm just looking for general scary stories that provide tension and horror in other ways.  Appreciate you all and thanks!

Edit: Thank you to everyone who put up recommendations!!! There are some fantastic reads that I will definitely be divulging in.

1703950149.0,What are some of the early red flags that a book will probably let you down?,"I was complaining about an incredibly obnoxious character from a book who made me not want to continue reading. It got me thinking about some of the 'red flags' that let you know early on a book is (probably) going to be disappointing.

Here are a few of mine:

1. The main protagonist is portrayed as a wisecracking character full of quips...and every quip is painfully unfunny, despite other characters thinking they are hilarious.
2. The author confuses 'gore' with 'scary.'
3. Related to the above: gore scenes that go on and on and on...because the author just wants to freak out the reader.
4. Obnoxious and boring characters. To explain - there is the old writing adage that your characters don't have to be likeable but they do have to be interesting. I'd add to this that if your characters are going to be obnoxious then you really have to make sure they are that much more interesting to the reader. Imagine a version of BBC's Sherlock who wasn't brilliant at solving crimes but was just an arrogant ass.
5. Similar to the above - obnoxious characters...whom the author doesn't realize are obnoxious. In other words, the characters are repellant because they are repellant...not because they are about to go through major character development and change as a person.

Those are just a few of mine. I'm curious if anyone else has similar flags.",horrorlit

1604260934.0,So I just finished reading The Exorcist... And others! (my October reading list + thoughts),"[https://imgur.com/a/asFSj4k](https://imgur.com/a/asFSj4k)

This year was the first time I decided to only read horror for one month. Obviously it had to be October! I have to say though, finishing on The Exorcist was not the best idea! For the first 100 pages I was scared helpless, then as the story progressed my emotions turned from bleakness to sadness.

just an FYI, I went into each book completely blind.

&#x200B;

HEX - Such a cool idea, I was hooked within the first 20 pages. I was disappointed when the plot didn't go where I was expecting. And I don't know if it stuck the landing fully. I had so many questions at the end about the witch. I felt that her lore wasn't fully explored. Thoroughly enjoyed it though!

The Troop - Sooo good! I honestly thought that the book was going to be a 'scouts vs evil' type of story, but having them have to essentially deal with each other was masterful. Loved the dynamic, the paper clippings and hearing transcripts definitely kept things spicy as a reader. I felt like an out sider looking in at the past, knowing what fate was going to meet everyone.

Clown In A Cornfield - You know how, when reading, there are times when you wish you could tell the characters what's going on, just to help them escape the evil fate that has ensnared them? Not here! I just wanted to see how the kids would fare! Such a quick and fun read. I actually had no idea it was a 2020 book! I just saw the cover and had to buy it :D

The Exorcist - What a rollercoaster of a book. The long chapters forced me to spend more of my free time reading it, as I didn't want to break the lovely flowing nature of each chapter. What an incredible story. Kinderman is a full on beast. The descriptions of some of the scenes were straight up chilling. Once I got past my initial dread, I just couldn't stop!

The Yellow Wallpaper - Damn this was insane! I've never read a short story that creeped me out so much. The style of writing was so unique to me, I guess that makes sense with it being written in 1900. And by the end it was downright unnerving. 

&#x200B;

I can't wait to do this again next year! I've already lined up my next horror books for November. But for now I think I'll take it easy before I return to Roshar with the mighty Brandon Sanderson!

1694419876.0,"Post-apocalyptic/virus/etc books that don't focus on military/""badass"" or teen characters?","Sorry in advance- I'm looking for pretty specific stuff and I've looked through past posts, but have come up short.

So I've been trying to find good audiobooks to listen to lately and I have a huge interest in post-apocalyptic and virus/pandemic stories (zombie or non-zombie). 

The thing is though...all of them seem to have the main character who is a ""badass"" male version of a mary sue or focus on military stuff. I've also found a lot of these books tend to have worthless female characters that have no purpose other than being a romantic/sexual interest. I don't often enjoy when the main character is a teenager since they're almost always written unrealistically and I prefer adult characters in horror stuff.

For pandemic/virus stuff, I'm most interested in the body horror, early infection and the early days of trying to stop it from spreading, and then the inevitable chaos and collapse. I love stories that have the characters find out things as they happen and you learn about things along with them. If that makes sense...

For post-apocalyptic stuff, anything desolate and about basic survival and exploration of ruined cities/towns, scavenging, etc is super fun to me. The more realistic the characters the better. They can be smart and resourceful, but it's annoying when they're written as ""special"".


books I've enjoyed are-
•World War z (duh)
•The Troop (the exception to my no teens rule since the characters were well done)
•Hell Divers...which I didnt actually enjoy that much since it relied heavily on badassery, military, and a way too smart kid, but it managed to hold my attention.
•The Hot Zone 
•Infected (the first one by Scott Sigler)

Please for the love of god don't suggest mountain man. 

**TLDR;** Any good post apocalyptic or virus/pandemic books that aren't focused on military or hyper masculine bad ass characters?

**Title:** [Rouge by Mona Awad](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/101160689)

**Oversimplified plot:** After Belle's mom dies mysteriously, Belle is pulled into a surreal world.

**Sub-genre:** gothic according to goodreads, idk how though

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!animal death!<

**Content Lines:** She used to tell you fairy tales at night, remember? Once upon a time. When you were a sad, dreamy little girl. each night you lay in your princess bed, surrounded by your glassy-eyed dolls, waiting for her like a wish. Tick, tick went the seconds on your Snow White clock. The moon rose whitely from the black clouds. And then...

**Rating:** 1/5

**Review:** If this wasn't written by Mona Awad, who's previous books I have absolutely adored, I would have DNFed this at chapter 2. Awad still brings her quintessential style in this dreamlike and surreal setting, but unfortunately I was just bored. The first half (two thirds?) is just so repetitive and dull. By the time things start to happen, I just don't care anymore. Yes, this novel touches on a lot of themes like mother/daughter relationships and beauty standards, but that barely matters if the majority of the book is a slog to get through. I regret wasting my time with this one and should have listened to my gut and DNFed it.

**Sub-genre:** cryptid

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** Virgil Orr couldn't believe his fucking luck.

**Opening Lines:** I remember a time when I didn't care about anniversaries. My exes would give me hell when the inevitable days arrived and, of course, I'd feel bad about letting these important milestones slip my mind. This forgetfulness had nothing to do with my love for them or the state of our relationship, just a simple expression of my own disdain for the calendar year.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** This novella is filled with a lot of tropes I specifically dislike and there's really not much subtlety in the message it's trying to deliver. However, it is filled with heart. The author obviously cares about the story they're telling, and despite the flaws this book has, that passion shows while reading it. Finally, it was a cathartic read, and I think a lot of people will rightfully overlook a lot of negatives because of that. I enjoyed this book and I am excited to read their other horror novel.

**Title:** [Silver Nitrate by Silvia Moreno-Garcia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63249718)

**Oversimplified plot:** Stop fucking with cursed films!

**Sub-genre:** historical fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** An engorged, yellow moon painted the sky a sickly amber hue, illuminating a solitary figure. A woman, standing between two sycamore trees.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** Right off the bat, I have to say this book has some of the best characterizations. The two protagonists were incredibly fleshed out and real; it was refreshing. The plot itself was captivating. I really enjoy paranormal and occult reads and Silver Nitrate had that to spare. At about 2/3rds into the book, however, the veil is lifted and while we get much more insight into this fascinating world, it comes at a pretty hefty cost. The anticipation and fear that was slowly building, instead of coming to a head, just vanishes.

**Title:** [Kaiju: Battlefield Surgeon by Matt Dinniman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57756777)

**Oversimplified plot:** Stuck in a VR game world filled with giant monsters, a man must do everything in his power to win and ultimately escape.

**Sub-genre:** LitRPG

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** yes. all of them.

**Opening Lines:** I should have known there was something wrong with the dude.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Vile, unnecessarily cruel, violent, and graphic. This book is dressed up as a man on a journey of vengeance and escape, but is ultimately a disgusting and depraved piece of work filled with torture and increasingly ridiculous plot devices. And fuck me if I didn't love every minute of it.

**Title:** [Whalefall by Daniel Kraus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62919162)

**Oversimplified plot:** There's no God to save Jonah this time.

**Sub-genre:** thriller, aquatic

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Content Warnings:** >!suicide, child abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** Highway 1 drones. Cypress trees roar. Gulls shriek in squadrons. Yet all Jay Gardiner hears is his father awakening the family at six a.m. Weekdays, weekends, holidays, the man's blood so attuned to tidal patterns that he gets up without an alarm to begin the bedroom invasions, cowbelling his coffee cup.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** I feel like the phrase ""I couldn't put this book down"" gets thrown around a lot but I truly couldn't stop reading this book. I skipped a meeting, I rescheduled a doctor's appointment, and I asked my partner to take care of the dog for the day because I had to finish this book as soon as possible. This book is claustrophobic beyond belief, not just physically but emotionally too. The first quarter of this book was a bit hard to get through because of how fast we go back and forth in time, but after the swallowing, this book was just absolutely incredible.

---

**Title:** [The Ghost Sequence by A.C. Wise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57188486)

**Oversimplified plot:** I never know how to summarize short stories... They're short stories.

**Sub-genre:** short stories

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!animal death/cruelty, child death, domestic abuse, suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** How many people can say they were there the night the trick went wrong and the Magician died on stage? Certainly, that first morning on the strip - dazed gamblers blinking in the rising light, the ambulance come and gone, with the smell of gunpowder lingering in the air - everyone claimed they knew someone who heard the Magician's Assistant scream, saw the spray of blood, saw a man rush on stage and faint dead away.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Top five horror short stories! I loved virtually ever single one. They're so creative and imaginative and all so wildly different from one another, I'm surprised they're all from one author and not an anthology. The way the scares are delivered are so carefully done. In some stories, it's done by having a juxtaposition of something so beautiful that the dread is just building because we fear it will be marred. Some of them are bitingly satirical and filled with dark humor. Some of them made me feel nostalgic and reminded me of some of my first scares as a kid. Highly, highly recommend.

**Title:** [The September House by Carissa Orlando](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64623481)

**Oversimplified plot:** There are rules to these things. Everything is survivable. Even a haunted house.

**Sub-genre:** haunted house

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!child death and abuse, explicit and violent domestic abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** It was our dream house.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** This one really surprised me. I thought this was going to be maybe another haunted house or horror satire based on the first chapter, but this is just on a level of its own. The depiction of domestic abuse is one of the best I've ever seen. It's an insidious thing that sneaks up on you and the way that the haunting amplifies those themes was just masterful. Super solid 5/5 and I can't wait to see what else this author writes.

**Title:** [Any Man by Amber Tamblyn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068781)

**Oversimplified plot:** For Maude, any man will do.

**Sub-genre:** thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Fail*

**Content Warnings:** >!graphic sexual abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** Am I in a body?

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** My heart was in my throat from page one. I got literal goosebumps multiple times while reading this book, which has never happened to me, ever. At the end of a chapter I would be on the verge of tears and the beginning of the next chapter would get an unexpected burst of laughter out of me. The voices of the characters are so incredibly real and that just makes for an even more emotionally impactful read. One of the best books I've ever read. I will be thinking about this book forever.

Hey folks! Wanted to request some feedback. If you've been following my reviews, you know that I love to always keep things changing and moving. One new idea that I had was a DNF section at the end of the reviews. I was thinking it would just be the title/author and then a quick line or two about why I DNFed it and that's it. I'm a bit on the fence about this for a couple of reasons: 1) I hate reading books below 3 stars so I DNF quite frequently and 2) If I didn't finish a book, I don't think my opinion matters about the book. But I just wanted to throw this idea out there and see if there's any interest. Let me know what you think!",horrorlit

**Title:** [The God Project by John Saul](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/908092)

**Oversimplified plot:** Something's wrong with these kids.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!a ton of child death, dog death, suicide, gaslighting!<

**Opening Lines:** Sally Montgomery leaned down and kissed her daughter, then tucked the pink crocheted blanket that her mother had made in honor of Julie's birth - and which Sally hated - around the baby's shoulders. Julie, six months old, squirmed sleepily, half-opened her eyes, and gurgled.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** Characters were unbelievable, actions done by antagonists were unbelievable, ending made me roll up eyes, and it was way too long.

---

**Title:** [Children of Chicago by Cynthia Pelayo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55878030)

**Oversimplified plot:** Hide yo wife, hide yo kids, cuz the pied piper is coming.

**Sub-genre:** Mystery, thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Death of children!<

**Opening Lines:** """"You're going to get blood in your coffee, Detective.""""

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** If you're a fan of police procedurals and want a bit of a fantasy element, you might enjoy this. I am agnostic to police procedurals and I've been liking them less and less. What's more is that it kinda fell flat for me, and the conclusion didn't pay off the build up.

---

**Title:** [Just Like Home by Sarah Gailey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57693472)

**Oversimplified plot:** The dead bodies of your serial killer father's aren't even the worst thing in the house.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Kidnapping/captivity, murder!<

**Opening Lines:** The Crowder House clung to the soil the way damp air clings to hot skin.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** It's one of those books that has that big twist that makes you gasp and then you love the story cuz it blew your mind. But the first half was so slow. But the ""twist"" didn't satisfy the build up. But there were so many potentially interesting details that never got fleshed out. But the scares weren't that scary. But but but. Just left me feeling disappointed.

**Title:** [The Summer I Died by Ryan C. Thomas](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/891472)

**Oversimplified plot:** When two young adults trespass on an old man's property, he kindly and patiently explains why that's impolite behavior.

**Sub-genre:** Splatterpunk

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** It's splatterpunk so yes to most things you're thinking of >!sexual assault, torture, gore!<

**Opening Lines:** To avoid the nightmares of that summer, I take caffeine and diet pills, any type of speed to keep me up for as long as possible. As a result, I haven't slept more than a couple of hours a night in a long time. My eyes have sunken near to the hollows of my skull and I shake with malnourishment because the pills suppress my appetite. My face is bruised and my thighs are dotted with purple welts and half-moon scars from where I have punched and pinched myself to keep myself awake. I am eroding. But this is a far better alternative than the dreams of that summer. That summer of lost innocence, pain, and bloodshed beyond anything you can imagine.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** Idk, this is just torture porn. Things are happening just to happen. At least in other splatterpunk books like Exoskeleton or Teratologist there's a reason behind all the shit that's happening. Maybe that was the point? That bad shit happens for no reason?

---

**Title:** [Reluctant Immortals by Gwendolyn Kiste](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59366206)

**Oversimplified plot:** Imagine having an ex so toxic that you have to be on guard for like 200 hundred years.

**Sub-genre:** Gothic, historical fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Abusive relationships with manipulation!<

**Opening Lines:** It's almost sundown in Los Angeles, and Dracula's ashes won't shut up.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** Had really high hopes for this one, and you can tell the author is talented. But my biggest issue is the protagonists' decision making. Just so many dumb choices. I'm reading along, enjoying myself, and then one or both of the protagonists will pick the worst option and it just took me out of the story completely.

---

**Title:** [Dark Matter by Michelle Paver](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8350864)

**Oversimplified plot:** Expedition to an arctic wasteland.

**Sub-genre:** Arctic, paranormal, historical fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!animal abuse, animal death!<

**Opening Lines:** Forgive me for this rather belated reply to your letter. You will I am sure understand why I found it hard to entertain your enquiry with any pleasure. To be blunt, you evoked painful memories which I have tried for ten years to forget. The expedition crippled a friend of mine and killed another. It is not something I care to revisit.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** I think the summary of this book sets unrealistic expectations. If you are looking for a slow-paced, atmospheric book set in the arctic with themes of isolation, you will like this book. If you're looking for an fast paced, ghost story, you will be disappointed.

**Title:** [Kin by Kealan Patrick Burke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12231218)

**Oversimplified plot:** All my friends are dead, cannibal ménage

**Sub-genre:** Thriller, splatterpunk kinda

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Sexual assault, cannibalism, incest, torture, suicide, child death, !<

**Opening Lines:** Everything is dead.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** Promising and brutal start and then things get a bit too muddled for me with the amount of POVs for what this story is. I liked it overall, but I think it could have been way better. It kinda reminds me of Brother by Ania Ahlborn but not as good.

---

**Title:** [The Ancestor by Danielle Trussoni](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46159088)

**Oversimplified plot:** When your family history is weirder than you thought.

**Sub-genre:** Gothic, mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Sexual assault, miscarriage, suicide, child death and abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** To discover you are the heir to a noble title in the twenty-first century is like winning a fortune in the lottery, the Mega Millions or a Powerball jackpot, only to find your prize will be paid out in francs or liras: suddenly you are rich, but rich in a currency that has no value in the modern world.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** The beginning really drew me; it was mysterious and intriguing, and then there was a major shift in tone about half way through that was jarring. Still enjoyable overall but not where I thought this book was going.

---

**Title:** [The Bighead by Edward Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/905659)

**Oversimplified plot:** What's the most depraved shit you've ever read or thought about? This book is probably 10 or 20 times worse.

**Sub-genre:** Splatterpunk

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** Yes. All of them.

**Opening Lines:** Even the opening line is graphic! You have been warned. >!She stove the baby's head in with a cast-iron skillet. The head burst like a pale, ripe fruit.!<

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** Well that was fucked up and honestly pretty fun lol. The only reason I'm not rating this higher is because the frequency and rapidity of POV shifts.

---

**Title:** [Mouthful of Birds by Samanta Schweblin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39872813)

**Oversimplified plot:** Surreal short stories.

**Sub-genre:** Short stories, magical realism, fantasy

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Animal abuse and death, sexual assault/abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** When she reaches the road, Felicity understands her fate. He has not waited for her, and, as if the past were a tangible thing, she thinks she can still see the weak reddish glow of the car's taillights fading on the horizon. In the flat darkness of the countryside, there is only disappointment, a wedding dress, and a bathroom she shouldn't have taken so long in.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** Some stories were fantastic and utterly captivating, some stories were just okay, and most of the stories left me wanting more. Schweblin's style is fairly unique and if you like her you'll like this.

---

**Title:** [I Call Upon Thee by Ania Ahlborn](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31302864)

**Oversimplified plot:** Stop. Playing. With. Ouija boards!

**Sub-genre:** Paranormal

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Suicide, drug abuse, chronic pain!<

**Opening Lines:** """"What the hell was that?!"""" Dillon bolted upright, his hair a perfect Albert Einstein emulation. She could practically hear his heartbeat thudding straight out of his chest.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** I'm a pretty big Ania Ahlborn fan, but this book didn't come close to some of her other works (like Brother). I wasn't a huge fan of the back and forth of perspective from childhood to adulthood of the protagonist. One thing I liked about it is that it doesn't follow the typical """"haunting"""" storyline. Enjoyable overall, could have been better though.

**Title:** [Thistlefoot by GennaRose Nethercott](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60018639)

**Oversimplified plot:** A woodworker and a chameleon man are bequeethed a walking house that's sought after by the longshadow man. Confused? Me too.

**Sub-genre:** Folk, retelling

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Child death, animal death, self harm, genocide!<

**Opening Lines:** Behold: *kali tragus*, the Russian thistle. A bushy lump of a plant, green flowers vanishing into green leaves. Its stem, striped red and violeta s a bruised wrist. The leaves are lined with spikes, sharp like stitching needles You are advised to wear gloves when handling it, if you must handle it at all. Should the thorns prick you, pretend you don't feel it. It doesn't do any good to grip in times like these. There are worse wounds to be hand than a thistle prick. Much, much worse.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** I know bupkis about Eastern European folklore so everything I read here was fresh and interesting and brand new to me. Some of the actions of the MCs were questionable and I was having some trouble figuring out which parts were meant to be unbelievable because it reads as a modern world with a lot of fantastical elements. Regardless, it is written very prettily and I found it enjoyable.

---

**Title:** [The Women Could Fly by Megan Giddings](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59629560)

**Oversimplified plot:** Witches exist today, and men hate it.

**Sub-genre:** Fantasy, dystopia

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Shit tier parenting, torture, misogyny, animal death!<

**Opening Lines:** On the day we all agreed that - yes, sure, okay, it's time - my mother was dead, I went to the storage unit where my dad kept all her stuff. I told myself if I wanted, I could burn it. Take all the boxes and clothes and loved things out into the parking log. Kerosene, matches, patience, ash. Instead, I decided I would sort through it, choose a few things to save, clean the rest out and save my dad some time and money. I am a pracical person.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** There's a few different things happening here at once and they are all paced differently so it's a bit jarring. That being said, I enjoyed this book. It's an emotionally challenging read, and if you're craving a dystopia that is more grounded, you'll enjoy this.

---

**Title:** [Full Brutal by Kristopher Triana](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36426220)

**Oversimplified plot:** Losing your virginity won't have any dire consequences, right? 

**Sub-genre:** Splatterpunk

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Sexual assault (like a ton), suicide, torture!<

**Opening Lines:** I'd heard that losing your virginity was a big deal. All the girls at school who'd had their cherries popped said it was a life-changing experience.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This entire book was like watching a trainwreck in slow motion. Every terrible decision that could have been made by the MC was made and then some. It was awful and I wanted to look away but I couldn't stop. You'll definitely need a palate cleanser after this one.

---

**Title:** [The Babysitter Lives by Stephen Graham Jones](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61228644)

**Oversimplified plot:** Babysitter slasher. ...or is it? ^^^it's ^^^not

**Sub-genre:** Paranormal

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Child death!<

**Opening Lines:** A mother carries her six-year-old daughter into the tiled bathroom where the bathtub is already running. Is still running. Is overflowing. And for a moment the girl calms, seeing her little brother floating face down in the water. His hair a golden halo around him. But then this mother is guiding her face first down into that water. That, as it turns out, isn't just water, but scalding water, and eleven years later her scream is the drawer screeching out of the counter by the sink.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This reminded me of R.L. Stine's Goosebumps books but for adults. You go into it thinking it is pretty obviously going to go in on direction and then it keeps making unexpected turns and ends up like a fever dream. Very fun ride.

---

**Title:** [We Need to Do Something by Max Booth III](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53014484)

**Oversimplified plot:** Family is stuck in a bathroom after a terrible storm.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!self harm, abuse, death of a child!<

**Opening Lines:** Our phones won't stop screaming, each slightly out of sync with the other, making the noises jarring and insane.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Tense and claustrophobic from beginning to end and constantly ramping up. And holy shit that one scene...

---

**Title:** [Sign Here by Claudia Lux](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59358268)

**Oversimplified plot:** Worker in Hell doing his best to get a promotion, while Earthside the Harrison's deal with their familiy's secrets.

**Sub-genre:** Fantasy, humor

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Self harm, child abuse, suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** You already have a lot of ideas about Hell. It's amazing what Dante and thousands of years of folklore can do to a place's reputation. I mean I'm not going to lie to you: it is Hell. It's not fantastic.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This is filled with things I typically don't like: multiple POVs, every character holding some sort of secret, rapid and frequent changes in perspective, but despite all of that I really enjoyed this book! I found the characters compelling, I really enjoyed the fantasy elements (Hell and its residents), and I found the ending to be satisfying. This is a strong debut and I'm excited to see what else the author puts out.

**Title:** [Exquisite Corpse by Poppy Z. Brite](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15320)

**Oversimplified plot:** A serial killer, a cannibal, a young runaway, and an AIDS patient walk into a bar.

**Sub-genre:** Splatterpunk

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Body horror, torture, gore, sexual assault, necrophilia, suicidal ideation, drug abuse, chronic illness!<

**Opening Lines:** Sometimes a man grows tired of carrying everything the world heaps upon his head. The shoulders sag, the spine bows cruelly, the muscles tremble with weariness. Hope of relief begins to die. And the man must decide whether to cast off his load or endure it until hsi neck snaps like a brittle twig in autumn.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This is the prettiest novel about cannabalistic and necrophilic serial killers I've ever read. Don't know what else I can say about this book that hasn't already been said; if you want to read extreme horror or splatterpunk, this book is a great place to start.

---

**Title:** [Leech by Hiron Ennes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59807968)

**Oversimplified plot:** Hive mind vs. ruthless parasite. Stakes? Humanity. Ready? Fight!

**Sub-genre:** Gothic, science fiction

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Sexual assault, child death, medical gore, animal death, infertility, miscarriage!<

**Opening Lines:** The sight of this old train car saddens me, though I cannot quite articulate why. There is something unnamable about the rattling of the empty wooden seats, so like the pews of a deseerted church, that puts me in a lonely humor. It is an unusual feeling, since I have never in my life been alone.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** I don't think I've ever been so thrown off by the difference in writing style and writing content. Gothic novels aren't usually my cup of tea and that's because of the writing style that's typically used, but despite that I really enjoyed this book and it had a solid amount of body horror and sci-fi throughout.  I've never read anything like this before.

**Title:** [Earthworm Gods by Brian Keene](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18891692)

**Oversimplified plot:** Bow down to your slimy new gods!

**Sub-genre:** Apocalyptic, monsters

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Sexual assault, child death, lots of death!<

**Opening Lines:** It was raining on the morning that the earthworms invaded my carport. The rain was something that I'd expected. The worms were a surprise, and what came after them was pure hell, plain and simple. But the rain - that was normal. It was just another rainy day.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Fantastic apocalyptic read that takes all the greatness of a giant evil entity type story and mixes it really well with intimate and greatly crafted characters. Can't wait to read the rest of this series.

---

**Title:** [Judas Goat by Greg F. Gifune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9643568)

**Oversimplified plot:** When you did your ex dirty and find out she's into black magic.

**Sub-genre:** Folk

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Sexual assault!<

**Opening Lines:** Lenny Cates is dead. Even now, an hour or more away from the nightmare, he could still hear traces of that strange voice uttering those words through a ghostly telephone line. Nightmares and memories were all he could count on these days, but both were notorious liars.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Gifune is quickly becoming one of my favorite horror authors. This story is so wonderfully written, there are no stray parts, nothing is there for the sake of being there and everything serves a purpose. This is an atmospheric book and is one of those books that worms its way in your head and makes you want to reread it.

**Title:** [Cannibal Corpse, M/C by Tim Curran](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16036907)

**Oversimplified plot:** Outlaw biker makes a deal with the government to do a snatch and grab in return for his brother. Oh also zombies and mutants and monsters and stuff.

**Sub-genre:** Post-apocalyptic

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!sexual assault, suicide, murder!<

**Opening Lines:** The wormboy cut in close, trying to sideswipe him, but Slaughter was ready: he brought out the big .357 Combat Mag and let it bark a couple of times. It was like thunder in the still air. The first round went wild, the other right on target. The wormboy cried out as the side of his throat was blasted to hamburger. He flipped off the shit-brown Duo-Glide Panhead, and hit the pavement, skidding on his face and leaving a greasy smear on the road. His bike went careening away, flipping over, spinning away in a shower of sparks.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Went in expecting a fun, turn your brain off, splatterpunky read and ended up with a still fun but thoughtful, unique, almost dark fantasy book with very well fleshed out story that still have all those """"fun"""" body horror elements.

**Title:** [A Night in the Lonesome October by Roger Zelazny](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62005)

**Oversimplified plot:** Game with dire consequences being played by Players and their familiars.

**Sub-genre:** Fantasy, mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Animal cruelty!<

**Opening Lines:** I am a watchdog. My name is Snuff. I live with my master Jack outside of London Now. I like Soho very much at night with its smelly fogs and dark streets. It is silent then and we go for long walks. Jack is under a curse from long ago and must do much of his work at night to keep worse things from happening. I keep watch while he is about. If someone comes, I howl.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** I have a handful of books that I like to reread for a variety of different reasons, and I know that this book will be one of them. Victorian setting, featuring a ton of huge names in horror, told in a daily diary style, with a lot of humor, told from the perspective of a dog. I mean, it sounds like a kitchen sink, but it's so clever and funny and endearing. I really, really love this book and I already can't wait to reread it next Octber.

**Title:** [We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89724)

**Oversimplified plot:** The Adams Family irl but they're not funny.

**Sub-genre:** Mystery, gothic

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!death, mental illness!<

**Opening Lines:** My name is Mary Katerhine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I disliked washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amita phalloids, the death-cup mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Shirley Jackson is the 🐐. Reading this book is like eating a gourmet meal. Sure, you can scarf it down and it will be delicious and you'll be stuffed. Or you can take your time, savor each bite, appreciate the depth of flavors, and really think about the time and effort the chef put into making it. You'll love it no matter what, but you can get so much out of this book besides just what's on the surface.

**Title:** [Motherthing by Ainslie Hogarth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60097451)

**Oversimplified plot:** Mother-in-law from hell.

**Sub-genre:** Humor

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Multiple abusive relationships, sexual assault, suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** The night Ralph's mother flayed her forearms, a woman in a red dress handed him a business card. I know how *woman in a red dress* sounds because I thought the same thing at first. When I got back to the ICU waiting room with our sodas, I said, """"What do you mean *woman in a red dress*, a Jessica Rabbit type came va-va-vooming down the hall, pendulum hips pounding sound waves into the souls of dicks?""""

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** A dark and biting, graphic and vulgar, gut wrenching and humorous. And on top of all of that, it's really, really smart. I am impressed, amused, and shocked. 

---

**Title:** [Night Film by Marisha Pessl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770398)

**Oversimplified plot:** Investigative journalism goes brrr

**Sub-genre:** Mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Suicide, sexual assault!<

**Opening Lines:** Everyone has a Cordova story, whether they like it or not.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Wowowow this book was a wild ride. I normally dislike the mystery genre, but I absolutely loved this book. It handles the mystery so well, there is so much intrigue. But it doesn't forget the characters; it's not mystery for the sake of mystery, no random plot twists that make no sense. This book is quite long but it is so well paced and so well written that it just flew by. Also, it's filled with newspaper articles, photos, handwritten notes that make it all the more atmospheric.

---

**Title:** [Our Wives Under the Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58659343)

**Oversimplified plot:** Miri's wife returns after a disastrous deep-sea mission, but something is off.

**Sub-genre:** Contemporary, queer

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** The Deep sea is a haunted house: a place in which things that ought not to exist move about in the darkness. *Unstill*, is the word Leah uses, tilting her head to the side as if in answer to some sound, though the evening is quiet - dry hum of the road outside the window and little to draw the ear besides.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Read this book slowly, take your time with it, let its prose wash over you. This is a hauntingly beautiful book with subtlety and ambiguity. It's not for everyone, but if you want a sapphic, heart-breaking, and poetic story with themes of grief and deep sea terror, give it a try. 

---

**Title:** [Winterset Hollow by Jonathan Edward Durham](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58934632)

**Oversimplified plot:** Having your favorite childhood story come to life isn't all that it's cracked up to be.

**Sub-genre:** Folk, fantasy

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Animal harm/death, suicide, torture!<

**Opening Lines:** The table was set and all were met with barleywine and beer  
There were kin around and smiles abound as Barley Day was here  
Glass-blue skies and pumpkin pies and bellies full of bread  
Stories of old about glory and gold and the paths the elders tread

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Unique and captivating. Things really kick into gear around the 25% mark, and from there it was really hard to put down. The prose is a little bit distracting, but despite that this book is absolutely killer. I can't wait to see what else this author puts out.

---

**Title:** [Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11557)

**Oversimplified plot:** The world blew up and, surprise, it wasn't because of the BBEG. But that doesn't stop him from trying to capitalize.

**Sub-genre:** Post-apocalyptic, magical realism

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Sexual assault, infanticide, mass death, torture, suicide, racism, pedophelia!<

**Opening Lines:** Once upon a time we had a love affair with fire, the president of the United States thought as the match that he'd just struck to light his pipe flared beneath his fingers.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** Incredible! Expansive and sweeping story that takes place over the course of almost a decade, yet there are little to no lulls. The characters are real and invoke gut feelings. And boy oh boy it doesn't skimp on the horror at all. There's one specific part that has been permanently engraved in my brain.

---

**Title:** [The Book of the Most Precious Substance by Sara Gran](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58945991)

**Oversimplified plot:** Two words: sex magic. Okay one more word: horny.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller, book about books, fantasy-ish, mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Dementia!<

**Opening Lines:** I first heard about the book from Shyman.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** The weirdest book I read this month. I don't know what I was expecting but it definitely was not this. Sara Gran has a knack for getting her books to burrow in my head. It's not fully horror, it's not fully fantasy, it's kind of its own thing. I found the plot to be fascinating, and the things that the protagonists faces and overcomes are like a gut punch. 

---

**Title:** [The Immaculate Void by Brian Hodge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34381059)

**Oversimplified plot:** ""Everything's connected. So when things start to unravel, it all starts to unravel.""

**Sub-genre:** Cosmic

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Trigger Warnings:** >!Pedophelia, torture, child abuse, domestic violence!<

**Opening Lines:** The prayer books have always gotten it wrong.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** This is the best cosmic horror novel I've ever read. The writing is stupendous, the plot is ambitious, and wow I just love everything about this book. It's also a very grounded cosmic horror; it has all the things that make a good cosmic horror but it never forgets what's most important: characters. Side note: The publishers screwed over Hodge and it's almost impossible to get a physical copy. I listened to it on Audible and unfortunately, the narrator is pretty bad. I'd recommend trying to find a digital copy of this book and even to try to email the author for one to see if he'll sell you a digital copy.

Check out my [previous reviews as well as my goodreads page](https://www.reddit.com/user/ylenoLretsiM/comments/y6g3cq/all_my_previous_book_reviews/)! If you're a bit of a nerd like me and like data, check out [this breakdown I made based on a bunch of different things](https://imgur.com/a/ny52mDn) like author's demographic, year published, sub-genre variety, what I read vs. listened to, and more.

It's been exactly a year since I posted my first long review on this sub and I've changed the way I do things quite a bit! I'm really having a good time and I hope you're enjoying my reviews as well. As always, I'm open to criticisms and suggestions, and generally, I love experimenting and trying new stuff (including the opening lines, for example).

Finally, I want to say that I have been very purposeful in picking a good mixture of books written by both women and men. Something I've noticed is that finding authors that are women requires more effort and it's not because a lack of talented women. Unless you're specifically subscribed to forums that promote the works of women or ask for books specifically written by women, most of the reviews and recommendations and top 10 lists you'll come across are dominated by male authors. 

I don't really know what to do to change or fix this besides being mindful and purposeful when picking which books to read and share in my reviews. I invite you to just see if you notice this in lists you find or even in your tbr or library and reflect on what can be done to change this.

Two things are clear: the author has no idea what the word ""ajar"" means, and his editor is incompetent.

Twice in the first 120 pages he's used ""ajar"" when he intended to use ""a jar"".

Still enjoying the story so far, but on top of these two there have been some other small things too. It's a bit immersion breaking and makes it feel like I'm reading an unedited draft.",horrorlit

I decided on a 30 book challenge and so far I have read 16 books. I'm pretty proud of myself. I read a mix of books recommended on here and some that I found through kindle/kobo. Here's what I read, a VERY brief (bad)summary, and thoughts on what I read. I'm going to be brief in my summary and thoughts as to not giving anything away. Literally anything. Go in blind for the ones I recommend. Do it. I'd I'd also really like to know what y'all have read so far this year, which books did you love/hate? Inb4 someone says why not wait and list/review all the books I read at the end of the year, my answer to that is I am impatient.

**The Last Town**(Wayward Pines #3) by Blake Crouch 

\-Bad Summary: man wakes up in town, man can't leave town, man is generally upset. 

\-Thoughts: This was a reddit recommendation that I loved, the whole series was SO much better than I had expectedand I highly recommend it. My heart breaks everytime I think about how the author won't write more about it.

**Sour Candy** by Kealan Patrick Burke

\-Bad Summary: Man confronts a mother with a bratty child. Bad move. 

\-Thoughts: I overhyped this story for myself and ended up feeling just 'eh' about it. I don't think I would suggest it.

**Negative Space** by B.R. Yeager 

\-Bad Summary: Teens do drugs. Turns out Drugs are bad. 

\-Thoughts: Someone suggested this book in this subreddit as a mix between lovecraft and Uzumaki. This book RUINED me. I was so sad(in a good way?) when I finished this book. Couldn't put it down. Highly recommend.

**If You See Her** by Ania Ahlborn 

\-Bad Summary: Friends go to a house. They go to the house again. Stop going to the house! 

\-Thoughts: It was an ok read. I found myself yearning for more though. If you're really into ghost stories, I'd suggest it.

**Dark Matter** by Michelle Paver 

\-Bad Summary: Old-timey men go on an expedition, two leave and one stays. Bad move, man. 

\-Thoughts: This book gets a ton of praise on here, and although I can appreciate/understand why, it just was not for me. I found myself bored throughout the entire book and honestly would not recommend it.

**Dear Laura** by Gemma Amor 

\-Bad Summary: Woman takes a thoughtful walk through the forest. 

\-Thoughts: This was a Kindle find. And I kind of wish I hadn't found it, very mediocre imo. Would not recommend

**Siberian Incident** by Greig Beck 

\-Bad Summary: A couple want to repopulate a lake in Siberia. The lake does not want that. Also the mob. 

\-Thoughts: Found this on Kindle. I liked it, I'm a big fan of this type of book, though I won't spoil it with what type it is. Was a fun read. I would recommend it.

**Suicide Fores**t by Jeremy Bates 

\-Bad Summary: Some friends/travellers go into the suicide forest in Japan and think it's a good idea to go off the path to find some dead bodies. Surprise, that wasn't a smart choice. 

\-Thoughts: I've read a few of his books and liked them. This book took a turn. All I'm gunna say. Fun read. would recommend.

**Bone White** by Ronald Malfi 

\-Bad Summary: A man's twin brother goes missing, he goes look. Spooks ensue. Also the townsfolk are assholes. 

\-Thoughts: Reddit recommendation that I found to be so-so. Wasn't great or all that fun, but wasn't necessarily boring or hard to get through. If you read the actual summary for it and it sounds interesting to you, I would say go for it, if you're on the fence, I say don't read it.

**How Much To..?** by Matt Shaw 

\-Bad Summary: How much money to do some REAL shit. 

\-Thoughts: This was a shock value book. I'm not a huge fan of books that try to shock/gross you out just for the sake of it. I don't think I would recommend it.

**How Much 2** by Matt Shaw 

\-Bad Summary: Seriously though, how much money to do some shit? 

\-Thoughts: I know. Why read the second if you weren't a big fan of the first? I don't like cliff hangers. So there. Still wouldn't recommend, btw.

**Last Days** by Brian Evenson 

\-Bad Summary: Main character is a SUPER popular amputee among a cult. Good for him. 

\-Thoughts: I found this book on a list and was immediately hooked on the premise. Half way through I found myself bored of it, sadly. Really fell flat for me. Would not recommend.

**The Sun Down Motel** by Simone St. James 

\-Bad Summary: Woman ditches home. Works at motel. Disappears. Niece thinks it'd be a swell idea to go find out what happened to her. 

\-Thoughts: This was a sub recommendation and I... was utterly let down. Tbf, I went into this book thinking it would be about something entirely different than what it was. I really, really did not like this book, from the way it was written, the characters, to the (imo) terrible ending. Wouldn't recommend.

**A Good and Happy Child** by Justin Evans 

\-Bad Summary: A new Father won't hold his child. Instead of going on Jerry Springer to sort this out, he sees a therapist. Good call. 

\-Thoughts: This book, what a tease. It amps up and up and up and then blegh. The 3/4 through the book it started to let me down. Because I enjoyed most of the book, I would recommend it.

**Home Before Dark** by Riley Sager 

\-Bad Summary: Father writes a book about the house him, his wife, and his daughter lived in for a brief period of time about it being haunted. Daughter, now grown, hates the book and inherits the house. Oh my, what wacky stuff is gunna happen now? 

\-Thoughts: Found this book through one of the many, many lists of books I search through online. I liked this book. It had me second guessing what I thought was going on quite a bit. I would definitely recommend it.

**Between Two Fires** by Christopher Buehlman 

\-Bad Summary: Set during the Black Plague, but wait, there's more! 

\-Thoughts: Sub recommendation. Personally, I think this book gets overhyped on here. It was a good book, for sure. I enjoyed reading it, but I found myself wait and waiting for something spooky or shocking to happen. Which to some who read it, spooky and shocking did happen, but for me it didn't. It was an all around solid book, nonetheless. I would recommend it.

And there you have it! Those are the books and the very minimal/terrible summaries and reviews. Again, I'd love to see what y'all have been reading, what you liked/disliked, and also what's on your list of things to read.

As for me, I have a massive list of books on my Kobo to get through. As of April, I have started 14 by Peter Clines and am enjoying it so far. I doubt I'll be able to keep up the pace I was reading at through these past three months, but I hope to get to my reading goal. I'm very happy with myself over getting back into reading so voraciously and hope y'all enjoyed my little review.

If you DO happen to enjoy this post, let me know, and I'll do another at the end of June. Seriously, I have like 50+ books on my Kobo just itching to be read.

I'd also love to chat about the books anyone has read or want to read 1-on-1, if anyone is interested, please pm me and we can go from there!",horrorlit

When I went to uni I just couldn't be bothered reading for pleasure any more and I just...stopped. My degree was pretty much desk based and it pained me to read huge textbooks during the day only to go home and read more at night (idk if that makes sense). 

I was in Waterstones one day - a few months ago - and I found Horrorstor by Grady Hendrix. I didn't look at the blurb or flick through the pages or stand and debate if I wanted it - I totally judged a book by it's (super weird) cover and bought it without even thinking. I devoured it in days and I fell in love with reading again. I've been going through some Agatha Christie and Stephen King and some young adult thrillers and I can't ever remember being this happy about reading.

All the women have hard nipples, perky tits, and tight shirts. I know this because he spends lots of time describing the boobs of every woman in every scene. Unless she's fat or old in which case they only act as horror props undeserving of further description because aging, overweight women are terrifying. ( /s )

I'm reading One Rainy Night and enjoying it, as long as I read it through the same lens I watch a cheesy 80s horror movie. The murder scenes are chaotic and borderline hilarious.

######(My favourite horror novels, bar none - recommended above all else)

* **[Necroscope Series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40853-necroscope) - Brian Lumley**

*Cold War era espionage between state-backed ESP agents. Add in the most monstrous vampires in all of fiction and the very powerful main character who can speak to and learn from the dead. Just so so good. Read it. The chronology confuses people so I'll break it down below.*

1. **Necroscope Saga** (books 1-5)

2. **Vampire World Trilogy** (books 6-8)

3. **The Lost Years Duology** (books 9-10)

4. **E-Branch Trilogy** (books 11-13)

*This is the core series. There are also spin-offs, novellas, novelettes, and short stories. I'd advise to read the above first and the rest later when you crave more.*

* **[Hellsing](https://www.goodreads.com/series/54879-hellsing) - Kohta Hirano**

*Vampire hunters vs Nazi vampires vs the literal inquisition. Sounds slapstick, but it's actually excellent horror. Alucard (ahem, subtle code) is an incredible character.*

* **[I Am Legend](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40940649-i-am-legend) - Richard Matheson**

*Forget the movie, they're vampires not zombies, and the MC is hunting them not hiding scared. Incredible story that once again earns its classic-hood.*

* **[Salem's Lot](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11590._Salem_s_Lot) - Stephen King**

# 2 - 2.5 stars

######(Average)

* **[A Coven of Vampries](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/438103.A_Coven_of_Vampires) - Brian Lumley**

*Collection of vampire related short stories. I'm not overly fond of the medium, so lovers of shorts might actually rate it higher, if anybody is a master of vamps it's Lumley.*

* **[The Fly By Nights](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/438103.A_Coven_of_Vampires) - Brian Lumley**

*Basically the exact same story as The Passage and a rare miss for Lumley.*

* **[NOS4A2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15729539-nos4a2) - Joe Hill**

*Wouldn't be one of my threads without at least one controversial opinion: this one needed about 300 pages culled. Weird guy with powers drains kids' life-force for his own extended lifespan.*

1643663181.0,I read 22 horror books in January and here's a short review of them all!,"Sorted lowest to highest:

[Consumed by David Cronenberg](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18775402-consumed) 2/5 - It had an intriguing start, a great premise (two globe-trotting journalist interview bizarre characters, and a lot of aspects that you would expect from Cronenberg - body horror galore and more). However, there were so many boring and tedious parts and the ending was just completely flat. Wanted to like this so much, but it was just OK.  
[Stranded by Bracken MacLeod](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28220842-stranded) 3/5 - Ship stranded in the arctic and strange things ensue! Such an interesting premise but really more of a sci-fi thriller than a horror. Unfortunately, the first half was much stronger than the second.  
[Witch by Iain Rob Wright](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57904623) 3/5 - I liked it but I didn't love it. I was intrigued at the beginning but around 60% through it became a bit predictable.  
[A Touch of Jen by Beth Morgan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55867897-a-touch-of-jen) 3/5 - I don't even know how to describe this book besides saying it's really, really weird and that I've never read anything like it. It did a really good job of creating characters that evoke a lot of different emotional responses from the readers. That being said, I hated all the characters! And while that was probably done on purpose, that's just not my cup of tea. Still, I found it enjoyable and was really impressed with the originality of the story.  
[Dark Harvest by Norman Partridge](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1201724.Dark_Harvest) 4/5 - You don't see second person narration done often and you see it even less done well. It was an interesting small town dark fantasy/horror story but not the most satisfying ending, in my opinion.  
[Wyrd and Other Derelictions by Adam Nevill](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51797060-wyrd-and-other-derelictions) 4/5 - I've never read anything like this. If you're into /r/liminalspace and are looking for a cross between that and Lovecraft, this is the perfect book for you.  
[The Devil All the Time by Donald Ray Pollock](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10108463-the-devil-all-the-time) 4/5 - Violent, dark, bleak, and pretty heavy. I really enjoyed this one!  
[Cirque du Freak Series by Darren Shan](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40449-cirque-du-freak) 4/5 - My nostalgia level reading this series was at an all time high. This was my childhood favorite series and what got me to love reading. This is strongly, strongly YA, maybe even middle grade, but there's a great and spooky story here with an amazing cast of characters, a wonderful premise that takes a lot of unexpected turns, and will always hold a special place in my heart.  
[Providence by Max Barry](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52027273-providence) 4/5 - Fun and exciting space sci-fi with elements of horror including AI, aliens, and more. I wish certain themes were explored more but overall it was enjoyable and fast-paced.  
[To Build a Fire and Other Stories by Jack London](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70791.To_Build_a_Fire_and_Other_Stories) 4/5 - There were a handful of stories in this collection that were so good that it made up for all the mediocre ones. I absolutely loved To Build a Fire, and despite this not being technically horror, that short story was undoubtedly terrifying.   
[Friday Black by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37570595-friday-black) **5/5** - Read this based on a recommendation without knowing anything about it, and I was absolutely floored. This book is intense and dark and utterly captivating. Every single short story in this collection evoked a strong emotional response.

1634250954.0,"TIL Christopher Buehlman (Between Two Fires, Those Across the River) is also a Renaissance Faire insult comic called ""Christophe the Insultor""!","Hiya fellow horror nerds,

(mods if this is not allowed plz delete with my apologies)

This past weekend (so I suppose this is less TIL and more TPWIL), my spouse and I went to a Renaissance Faire in Ohio. In line to get in, a performer asked offered us a flyer for an insult comic. 

Looking at the flyer ([front](https://ibb.co/K08KsNT) and [back](https://ibb.co/2WF9DdX)), I cannot overstate my utter shock to see that the insult comic is none other than horror author Christopher Buehlman! 

What the fuck? Seriously? I literally finished *The Lesser Dead* like two weeks ago! I haven't read *Between Two Fires* yet, but *Those Across the River* was goddam amazing.

The show was super fun - people paid for insults to their friends and family, the more expensive the nastier, culminating in an auction-type thing for the finale. The resulting insult cost $954 and lasted about 20 minutes. Anybody who threw in a hundo got an autographed copy of his new fantasy novel *Blacktongue Thief*, which I thought was a great hustle.

When I went to speak with him after the show ([pic](https://ibb.co/q5Df4HC)), he seemed genuinely surprised that I knew him from the books. 

Since this sub pointed me in his direction, and Christopher Buehlman recommendations are so common here, I thought I'd share this bizarre little tidbit for anybody else who might find it interesting.

1599481285.0,Southern Gothic Horror,"Hello all! First time posting here. I am hoping this fine community can help me rekindle my love for reading!

I have been a professional editor since 2007, and most of my time has been spent editing non-fiction books. Sometime around ten years ago I noticed I was unable to read for pleasure anymore--or rather, it was no longer pleasurable. Being an editor, I read everything for errors as a default mode, and I found it difficult to reroute that. I would have to read passages multiple times, which took too much energy...or I'd simply fall asleep. 

Throughout the covid isolation I made the decision to change this. I attempted the Southern Reach trilogy and that was a bad first choice, so I decided to ease into it by revisiting some old favorites. I quickly ripped through a few King titles before I came across my beloved Faulkner collection (my username is from As I Lay Dying). That reminded me how much I love both horror and southern gothic! 

I'm wondering if you finely read folks might have some suggestions in this subgenre of a subgenre. I know Harry Crews (Feast of Snakes)and Cormac McCarthy (Blood Meridian) have for sure written novels that fall into this category. I'd like to start at a Crews and work up to a McCarthy. 

Thanks in advance!

Edit to add: I really should have included Anne Rice and Flannery O'Connor as examples of this genre--they are the undisputed queens!

Another edit: I am so grateful for the suggestions I've gotten! I will be out and about today so I can't keep up with every comment but just know I really appreciate anyone taking time out of their day to suggest something! I'm eager once again to read for enjoyment and discover some new-to-me authors, a thrilling feeling for a bibliophile. thank you all so much (and I hope when I come back to discuss some of these that you'll comment again)!",horrorlit

1692240640.0,My thoughts on extreme horror,"To preface, I don’t think it’s wrong to read extreme horror, and I don’t think someone is below me or less intelligent than me for enjoying it. I even enjoy it from time to time. 
What I don’t understand is the hype surrounding certain books being “the most disturbing and vile book ever written” and I read it, and it literally feels like I’m reading an edgy wattpad story written by a 13 year old kid. Every single one I’ve read has felt so forced, so dumb, even boring at times and I don’t get how you could like take something like that seriously. Like even for comedy sake, it’s not funny. Haunted, naked lunch, the sluts, those all made me laugh with the intentional satirical takes and jokes. Extreme horror writers just sound like a kid that plays too much Fortnite trying to be edgy (a times). I get the appeal, some of my favorite horror movies are genuinely just bad and stupid gory fun. I think sometimes it surprises me when I hear certain extreme horror books being praised not in a “it’s entertaining and silly” way, but more “it’s so dark and disturbing and shocking” way.",horrorlit

Edit: oh boy the typos in that title. I’m educated I swear.

Edit 2: many thanks for all the recommendations! I want to clarify that I’m not just looking for things like plot points explained. Certainly I can go back and read it a second time to realize that the words of the old man at the gas station are much clearer now that I know what happened next. It’s more that “you don’t know what you don’t know,” like if the author was a Shakespeare buff and sprinkles subtle references throughout, or if the book was written during a certain historical event that isn’t as well known now but informs the narrative. I personally like having that context. I can enjoy the book without it of course, but I like to enrich the experience for a book I particularly enjoy, like The Elementals.",horrorlit

1628194778.0,When people say writers should stop with a genre because “it has been done to death”,"I really do dislike hearing people say this or reading comments like this, and what brought this discussion on was a comment on a FB post of mine advertising my zombie outbreak book. Now, this person obviously felt the need to comment his opinion, which is fine, but I see this sort of comment often. As a scifi-horror reader/writer, I came here to discuss.

Every genre and subgenre has been “done to death,” but it always seems like it’s specific tropes in genres that get this comment more often. For example, I often hear this when talking about zombie fiction.

I *love* zombies. I will read zombies, watch zombies, and play zombies all day long, and it’s quite frustrating when people kill your mood by saying “[enter trope here] has been done to death. Can we just stop?”

If we followed that mindset, we’d really have nothing…Tropes exist for a reason: people like them. It’s when a trope is done poorly that people start to get sick of them, and that’s where I think the issue lies.

For zombie fiction in particular, there have been some pretty bad zombie movies, and I’ve read some pretty bad zombie books. I do, however, find that better zombie fiction resides in books and games.

What’re your thoughts on this line, especially in the horror genre? (This doesn’t have to be specifically about zombies. They were just an example!)",horrorlit

Horror has a tendency to report a lot of tropes and most don't bother me, but the one trope that is used way too often is the unnecessary killing of animals. I can understand it if it adds something to the story, but honestly I'd prefer if they leave that out. 

For example, I was loving a book up until 3/4 of the way through when they killed the family dog. The book would've been just fine had they left that out. We know the ""bad guy"" is evil. You don't have to convince us by having them kill an animal.

I also like that I can't even slightly predict how all of this is going to climax.

Jacob had been retired for some years due to a chronic debilitating illness -- I don't know if it was related to her death. I will miss her a great deal. Her writing was VERY stylized and too much at times even for me as a fan of hers, but she was certainly a unique voice in horror.",horrorlit

1675273174.0,"Given the HWA's announcement that they've unanimously voted to ban Thomas Monteleone, do you separate the art from the artist and what's the tipping point?","In [a statement released yesterday](https://horror.org/thomas-f-monteleone-statement/), the Horror Writer's Association has announced that they've ousted Thomas Monteleone, award-winning horror author and editor. They unanimously voted to ban him for life and strip him of the benefits associated with his Bram Stoker Awards and Lifetime Achievement Award for violating their anti-harassment policies.

Essentially, Monteleone went on a couple of public racist, misogynistic, and anti-trans rants, accusing the HWA of ""wokeness"" and ""virtue signaling"" for honoring authors that aren't white males. When he was called out, he doubled down on his statements. If you're curious about the details, there's [a summary of the events leading to his ban](https://file770.com/thomas-monteleone-ousted-by-horror-writers-association/) on the File 770 blog. Monteleone has written numerous horror and sci-fi novels and non-fiction books, and he also edited the first six *Borderlands* compilations.

We all know that Lovecraft was an unabashed racist, but most of us still recognize his contributions to the horror genre. Perhaps the cognitive dissonance is easier with an author that's been dead for nearly 100 years. But many modern authors have experienced rather spectacular falls from grace; examples might include Marrion Zimmer Bradley and JK Rowling. Some view this as honoring their personal sense of ethics while others call it cancel culture.

So, my question is: Do you separate the art from the artist and what's your tipping point?

I cited them as examples to illustrate how different my reaction was to each of them. It's part of why I find this conversation so fascinating.",horrorlit

This book was edgy for the sake of itself. Unnecessarily gross, and WAY too sexual, and I’m no prude…I typically like sexy stuff in books. I kinda get the ‘why’ of that, based on the ultimate end, but it was just SO descriptive, when it didn’t need to be. 

I expected, going in with no knowledge of the contents, some extreme HORROR, but it was just… gag-worthy and disgusting. If you think that disgust is an element of horror, then this is the book for you. But it wasn’t *scary* at all. In the traditional sense of ‘horror literature.’ I had to force myself to finish it. 

Also- it was SO predictable. People have mentioned a ‘twist’ but I saw that shit coming a mile away. Granted the last few paragraphs were sort of unexpected, but in retrospect, the ending was alluded to many times. 

Not to mention the typos and grammatical errors! I was disappointed and annoyed by the numerous misspellings, wrong pronouns for established characters, etc. like the editor just gave up and started skimming at some point, and I wish I had too. 

Overall- I wouldn’t recommend this book at all, to anyone, especially someone looking for a genuinely ‘scary’ read! Nothing scary about it, only gore and gross. Hah. 

What’s the appeal- for the fans? For people who have recommended this book (countless times in this sub) Why do you suggest it? Did you enjoy it? Was it scary to you? Were you frightened, or appalled and disgusted? I’m genuinely curious about the appeal. Is it more of a ‘shock’ thing, or an ‘I’ve had to experience this, and so should you?’ Or did you really enjoy the read? Were you scared? 

I can see how disgust can be an *element* of horror, but Mr. Ralston just seemed to rely on that aspect alone to carry the entire book. 

I don’t know what to do with this thing now. I can’t give it away, can’t sell it to my book-buyer… it’s seriously the only book I’ve EVER considered just burying in the yard to save others the trouble. It was *terrible!* (of course I’d never destroy a book, just gonna have to hold onto it until I find someone who’s *super* into gore-porn books🤷‍♀️)

1712685045.0,Dracula! My first book,"I just finished reading dracula which is my first ever novel

I really enjoyed it this i understand why this is stated as a classic in the horror genre.

The first act was definitely the best part of the book, i wished they explored it more the castle was extremely well done the tone was set really nicely and dracula crawling on the castle walls sent chills down my spine.
Every character is really well done the chemistry between all the characters is really good the bromance between all the male characters was great to read

It was a little boring at some parts which could have been well done and the ending was a little anticlimactic, I hoped dracula would put up a fight before going down.

Mina, van Helsing, renfield were my favourite characters.

Some scenes were really emotional and you can feel the exact emotion the characters are feeling as the writing is so detailed and delicate,

Some really frustrating and face palm movements too.

I wanted to see more of dracula too he has too little of screen time for having the whole book named after him(but I also think it adds to his mystery, and cunningness).


Over all a really good read!

“No live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality; even larks and katydids are supposed, by some, to dream. Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more. Within, walls continued upright, bricks met nearly, floors were firm, and doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.”",horrorlit

For fans of- 

Wanderers - Chuck Wendig 
The Reapers Are The Angels - Alden Bell 
Station Eleven - Emily St John Mandel 

Plot -

""It's been a century since ""the great consumption."" Humanity has been devoured to the edge of extinction by the ever-ravenous Shivers - terrifying, shapeless creatures that latch onto their hosts, tormenting them over time before consuming them all at once. The last of civilization lives in the crumbling city of Atlas, where they subsist on processed insects and await their inevitable fate. Anthem is the city Exilist, tasked with trapping the Shivers and banishing them to the malevolent Deadlands outside the city walls. But Anthem is ailing and destined to soon fall victim to his own Shiver, a fate he's reluctantly accepted. As Anthem begins to withdraw from his world, a threat he's unprepared for comes hurtling home. If he is to save anyone, he will have to travel into the Deadlands in search of a remedy to tame these creatures. But no Atlas dweller has ever made it back alive, and Anthem must confront his own darkness before humankind is forever lost to the monsters in our shadows.""

He also prays on the wife of a police officer who has been shot (later it turns out something was wrong with the officer when he recovers but not sure what)

Anyways the daughter heals and it turns out that the mother made a deal that made her relive her fathers sexual abuse, so the senator takes over the bargain and it turns out he's going to be president some day which is why salk wanted him.

And the story involve like a god that is wronged by the village and curses them and this is the outcome of that curse.

  
*These events are presented outside of chronological order and deal primarily with the efforts of the viewpoint characters to both escape the town and find answers to what has happened in the three days immediately following the disaster.*  
*Initially presented as being merely an earthquake the disaster is rapidly shown to be far more bizarre and wide-ranging. The majority of the population has become infected with an unknown affliction that appears to severely damage cognitive function, causing them to bleed from the eyes, become violently hostile on sight towards anyone not also infected and seemingly immortal, able to recover and heal from even the most grievous of injuries in a short time. All natural water sources and rainfall in the town have been replaced with a strange liquid (referred to as ""Red water"") and the town, previously located in a mountainous region deep inland, has become an island surrounded on all sides by an ocean of the red water with no other land in sight. Furthermore, multiple sections of the town appear to have been replaced with past versions of themselves with buildings destroyed by landslides 27 years prior, although derelict as if abandoned for decades, suddenly reappearing or replacing their more modern counterparts.*

1712600554.0,Am I unfit for horror books?,"Hi all. 

I would like to say I am such a big fan of the horror genre as a whole. 
- My favorite film genre is horror. 
-Playing horror games with friends is so much fun. 
-Halloween and October have always been my favorite time of the year. 
So naturally, I wanted to give horror books a try.

I started at the beginning of this year with The Troop. I thought it was fine, it just didn’t have an engaging story. But where my real troubles began was with The Girl Next Door. 

I didn’t really know what I was getting into with that book. And even if I did, I don’t think it would have stopped me from at least trying it. But roughly 3/4 of the way through, I had to put it down never to return again. I felt incredibly angry that adults like this exist in the real world, and I remember the disgust that stayed with me for multiple days after.

After a week or two of reading something else, I turned to Stephen King. Having seen many of Stephen King’s adaptations on the big screen, I wanted to try a story I had no knowledge of. And that story, was Pet Sematary.

I was really loving it at first. The mystery, the setting, and the characters all had me intrigued. But halfway through the book I had to DNF. I was too sad. I got a couple chapters past part 2 and couldn’t go any further. It was affecting my mood. 

Maybe I’ll give it another shot one day, but those stories were just so damn depressing. My question is: should I bother reading more horror? I know those were only two books, so maybe they’re rather extreme examples. But movies and games have never knocked me out quite like that. And I’m afraid of running into the same situation again.

Does anyone have advice?",horrorlit

But I have been reading nothing but H.P.L. for quite some time so I decided to try the King in Yellow as I find it mentioned a lot in lovecraftian media (I was mainly effected by the Myscatonic Mysteries MC mod). I must say I enjoyed the first short story, but its not at all what I hoped for and what I was imagined from what I saw from fandoms and etc. 

So thats my rant about the book and now for my question.

1712595855.0,Does anyone else find that Adam Nevill makes eldritch horror more accessible to those who normally wouldn't read those types of horror stories?,"I always feel a little left out (not really, but ykwim) when people are talking about their favorite Lovecraftian/eldritch/cosmic horror books and how terrifying they find those types of stories. I've never been a huge fan of them myself and have never really found them ""scary"". Maybe I'm too dumb to conceptualize the terror of confronting something like Cthulu or some other old god that has been around for millions of years and doesn't care if I live or die.

I've read many of this sub's favorites in the genre: The Fisherman, Revival, Books of Blood, etc. And while I have enjoyed them somewhat and can certainly say that they are well-written stories (Clive Barker epecially has such a beautiful and vivid writing style and I love him), I've never found them scary and have had a hard time understanding what exactly makes them scare others.

Enter Adam Nevill. I'm still going through his bibliography, but after reading a few of his books, I can say that his approach to eldritch horror resonates with me so much more than the ""classics"" of the genre and has made me appreciate and understand the raw terror that the more traditional authors of the genre can instill in their readers.

So far, I have read The Ritual, The Reddening, and No One Gets Out Alive. All three of them were terrifying for me because they start off by appealing to something that truly scares me, personally: the fear of being hunted by an unknown entity in the wilderness; the fear of stumbling upon a violent cult who will ensure you have a painful and undignified death; and the fear of a malignant spirit/demon slowly causing someone's mind to degrade into mindless and murderous rage. I mean, I don't wake up each day with these fears in my head, but I can put myself in those situations as I'm reading and identify with the terror the characters must be feeling.

Each one of these stories has landed in the realm of eldritch/cosmic horror by the end, and I'm so grateful to Adam Nevill for telling these stories in a way that makes me understand why people love them. I think he does a great job of putting his characters into seemingly more modern and relatable situations and slowly dragging them through unimaginable horror that ends up being caused by an ancient god/demon that has no regard for, or even utter hatred for, human life and/or suffering. I feel like I finally understand why the genre is loved by so many horrorlit fans. Now I want to go re-read a few books and look at them in a different light.

Has anyone else had this experience? Did this make any sense at all? I was trying to tell my husband my thoughts on this the other night when I finished No One Gets Out Alive, and he looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language, lol.

What I am *NOT* looking for: 

- abusive teachers (as the only focus, they can be part of the plot) who are in the system *only* to abuse it for their other unrelated goal. I.e. groomers or teachers trying to get revenge on an enemy through that enemy's child. 
- horror in educational institution setting but the setting can easily be replaced with a different one. 

What I am looking for:  

- teachers and teacher figures as antiheroes or villains with complex morals *related to their role as teachers*.
- educational systems as a horror element.

If you imagine Eileen, but the story is about Rebecca and how she goes around forcing confessions out of (who she believes are) bad parents, this would be close to what I am looking for. It doesn’t have to be about punishing parents. I mean it in terms of the general focus. 

In terms of the vibes(!) I am also thinking about Matilda (children’s book), Girl from Nowhere (Thai TV show), Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei (manga and anime), and Assassination Classroom (manga and anime).

1712536497.0,"Any recs for body horror that is more ""existential""??","Hey so what I mean by this is, body horror as in, more than surface level imagery, more so about the themes and primal fear of the body. Stories thematically focusing on putrefaction, rot / decay, and the horror of having a body, being ill, disgust at one's physicality etc. as a major point of focus. I'm fine with outwardly grotesque imagery, as long as the -themes- are really honing on in the fear of physicality and decay. I'd try to provide an example but honestly I have trouble thinking of any, so go ahead with any and all recs if you have them. I prefer literary horror, so recs with more prose-focus would also be appreciated, but I don't mind pulp either as long as it's well written. Thank you!!",horrorlit

Ok the book it was wow there was so much I could comment on this is the first book I've read my Alison Rumfitt and it was intense.

I couldn't steer away from the constant thought of how everything happening from the parasite metaphor to the kink to Frankie's and Vanya's relationship all just being a fucked up metaphor for love and obsession. The way both were hypersexual as a way to get some form of intimacy and love and ending up getting into a situationship with each. The fact that Alison had the entire book to wrap around and foreshadow the ending, it was gorgeous. It felt that so much of the book held metaphors in every other line and it truly was so enjoyable to dissect the book while reading. It was also a buddy read so it was a ride getting to read it with a friend. Truly an enjoyable read, probably an 9/10 for me, I don't think I'll ever forget it.",horrorlit

1712488333.0,Some really excellent horror books I’ve read recently  ,"Fever House - Keith Rosson: The most beautifully written book about a severed hand you’ll ever read. Just a fucking wild ride from start to finish. It’s metal. Part 2 is out later this year and I can’t wait. 

This Wretched Valley - Jenny Kiefer: One of the best horror openings since The Empty Man (the movie, sorry I’m crossing mediums.) I read it in one sitting. Highly recommend if you want a gripping, genuinely creepy and original page-turner and don’t mind a bit of gore. Blaire Witch on steroids. And it’s her debut novel!! 

A Child Alone with Strangers - Philip Fracassi: Impeccably paced with characters you could read about forever. It manages to perfectly balance horror with humanity. It’s weird and sad and not for the faint of heart. 

Echo - Thomas Olde Heuvelt: One of the strangest books I’ve read in a while. Again, an opening that will give you goosebumps and similar to This Wretched Valley in that there’s a “haunted nature” vibe.

Little Heaven - Nick Cutter: I’m super late to this and I know it’s not his most talked about book - but I loved this one the best. I got way too attached to the characters, was hooked by the duel timelines and the punch-in-the-gut ending solidified this as a great book for me.

I saw it as a recommendation here some months back, and immediately put a hold on it at the library because I was looking for some claustrophobic or oceanic horror. Turns out it’s about a diver from SoCal, which, hey, I’m that, who gets swallowed by a whale, which, hey wtf? 

What ensued was some of the most unique, claustrophobic scenes with incredibly realistic scuba diving and (presumably) realistic whale guts doing what whale guts do. Usually, the immersion is broken when a book uses scuba diving due to some small inaccuracy that most people wouldn’t even think to include, but the only time I surfaced (hehe) was to point out everything I recognized as familiar. Amazing prose, fantastic planting and payoff 10/10 no notes. (Ok some notes, but any issue I had was subjective gripes that don’t take away from the effectiveness of the story. )

1712448870.0,No one gets out alive - infuriating plot point or not?,"I'm currently reading Adam Nevill's No One Gets Out Alive, minor spoilers ahead I suppose.

Stephanie is trapped in this awful house because she has no money and can't find work. She frequently frets about her desperate financial situation - it's a crucial plot point because otherwise she could have left in the first chapter.

But every time we're reminded of how broke she is, I can't stop thinking about why she wouldn't be on social security benefits, or take steps to get them. It's literally the first thing you do when unemployed and looking for work - not that she'd be rolling in cash, which sort of makes it even more annoying because it could easily have been incorporated into the story to make it feel more authentic. As it is though, her poverty feels too contrived to keep her there, like a cheap plot device or like the author has not experienced/properly researched experiences of poverty.

It is making it difficult for me to buy into the story - probably because I have been in a similarly desperate situation (sans all the supernatural despair) when younger and it doesn't ring true that you wouldn't look into unemployment payments/youth allowance or whatever they have in the UK. 

On the other hand, I'm perfectly aware I might just be hyper focused on unimportant semantics or ignorant to the UK social support system (I'm Australian).

1712344568.0,Negative space ,"I would like to start by saying I am NOT a huge reader. I do not read a lot, but I’ve been looking for a good horror book that deals with existentialism and Negative Space by B.R. Yeager seemed right up my alley. And up my alley it absolutely was. This novel was truly a disturbing, disgusting, and soul sucking masterpiece. 

It is easily the most bleak piece of media I have ever sunk my teeth into. Every time I put down the book I just sat there for at least 10 minutes, pondering on what was going on. Nothing has ever left me so speechless, so shaken, and so genuinely scared for characters in a story. 

I do think that the ending felt a little… lackluster in comparison to the start and middle parts of the book, but I also think it wraps it up in a surreal and “up for interpretation” type of way, which fits for the novel. 

The characters were all so, so interesting. Lu and Jill epically, but Ahmir wasn’t bad by any means. And Tyler was an amazing character, I was so insanely engaged every time his name popped up or something involving him was occurring. 

I can’t get over how brilliant the writing is. The sharp and disturbing diction tossed around touched me in more ways than one. I love how Yeager used different phrases for simple things. Like, for example, how he would write “going wet” and “going full wet” instead of crying. And how he never said people were mad or sad, instead opting for “her eyes had knives. Knives and full blue” 

Lastly, the trio of main characters and the way their perspective shifts is so entertaining and intriguing to read. Having two characters in the same place and seeing both of their thoughts as the narration flipped between them was genius. I also am obsessed with how Tyler is definitely a main character, but the only main character that isn’t in this frame. 

I’m wondering what other people think about this book. Please let me know! And if you know any books in a similar vain to this one, please drop the title and author 🙏",horrorlit

I recently finished ""Black River Orchard"" by Chuck Wendig, and that would have been perfect. Good mix of scary elements, but nothing too gory. For context, her recent pick was “None of this is True” by Lisa Jewell, which is true crime/mystery style.  
She knows a horror book is coming, so she is ready for something new. With that in mind, what are some recommendations as an intro to the genre that also would be fun to discuss along the way?",horrorlit
1712337942.0,Geek Love by Katherine Dunn,"
Has anyone read Geek Love by Katherine Dunn? 

I’m not sure if it would be classed more as literary fiction rather than horror, or a mix of both, but the premise is a couple who own a travelling circus experiment with drugs and poison during their pregnancies to have children they can make shows out of. It was devastating and horrifying and honestly one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. I felt so much for (most of) the characters.

I mostly enjoyed the perspective of the narrator (one of the children)  who had never known anything different to the awful life she was living (this is what made me cry the most, just the fact she didn’t understand what was so bad about her life). Sort of a similar perspective to Brother by Ania Ahlborn where the main character knows no different to the horrors he commits. Or if you’ve seen the movie Dogtooth where the parents shelter their children from the outside world completely. 

I know this is probably a weird perspective to want to read from but I find it so interesting. 

If you have read it, do you have any recommendations that are similar? They don’t have to be about travelling circuses haha.",horrorlit

1712291137.0,Good existential/cosmic horror reads that ties in love?,"Something I love about existential/cosmic horror is it often plays into the human experience to elicit fear and/or reflection. It usually makes some sort of commentary on existence or concepts we cling onto in our day to day lives that we take for granted. One of these experiences, that has great influence over many of us, is love. I don't quite know what that would look like, or if it even exists, but I would love to read a story that plays on our concepts of love, desire, affection; and uses, manipulates it in order to create horror. So, I am not referring to your typical romance novel - I'm not looking to feel the rush of a well crafted love story. I'm searching for something that will lead me to philosophically question our conception love, in existential horror fashion. I would prefer short stories especially right now; I greatly enjoy the thrill of bite size horror pieces.

1712240131.0,just finished the ritual by adam nevill--i have thoughts to discuss! spoilers below.,"so, i've seen a few posts about this novel here, but none of them super recent and none of them actually about the thing that bothered me the most about this book. since i just finished it, i decided to throw my hat in the discussion ring.

to preface, i want to say i LOVED this book. i was concerned at first, because everything seemed to be happening so fast compared to the length of the book, but eventually it completely sucked me in and i forgot to wonder ""why am i only halfway through when so much has happened?"" i found the pacing absolutely riveting, and adam nevill conveys such wonderful feelings of wrongness and despair.

that being said, i've seen many people voice complaints with the second half of the book. i actually loved pretty much all of the book, and the black metal cult didn't bother me or strike me as cheap--imo, a cult would have been much more cliche, and i liked the chaos of these three young adults clashing with the existing presence of an old religion there in the forest.

no, my main nitpick with this novel actually comes with literally the last three pages. i hadn't seen anyone bring this up before--most convos about this novel seem to revolve around the black metal band--but i felt like it was so unsatisfying to have luke survive all that only for the novel to end with such an obvious, vague idea like ""in the grand scheme of things, humans don't really matter to the universe"". did anyone else feel that way?

throughout the entire novel, luke seemed preoccupied with the idea of being lonely, with not forming connections with the people around him and being generally dissatisfied with life. at one point, he decides that he's going to live purposefully if he survives his ordeal, and i feel like that would have been a much more satisfying end to the novel.

thoughts? critiques? all are welcome! i'm curious if anyone felt the same way. i honestly liked the ending of the movie a little better, just because luke screaming back at moder felt so satisfying!",horrorlit

1712205370.0,Thoughts on the Haunting of Hill House TV show?,"I saw a post on Shirley Jackson and it made me think of Haunting of Hill House. I watched it a while ago and thought it was great. I went and read the book afterwards, and my opinion of it changed. The original book centers around the relationship between Eleanor and Theodora, and all of the mysterious hauntings build up to the dramatic ending. It's really brilliant. The tv show is just completely different, and in my opinion would have been much better as an original show. It had some cool ideas- I liked how they wove together the different timelines. Although there were some issues with it that weren't adaptation related, mainly with the pacing. 

There's a lot of issues with the show, but I think the worst part is probably that they gutted the character of Theodora. They made her boring! As a lesbian myself, I don't think that the tv show is ""better representation"" than the book because they made her sexuality more explicit (although it's already pretty obvious in the book). In fact I think that it was kind of homophobic that she was written to kiss her sister's husband for no reason. When I watched it I assumed that was something from that book that they kept in, but it wasn't. Genuinely no clue why that was in there- to add drama? 

There were also a lot of elements that were kept in but just didn't make sense because of the changes to the show. For example, when she tells the story about throwing a rock at a greenhouse in the book, it's to show her rebellious nature. But in the show, she's not written as rebellious so it just feels pointless.

I will say though, the one thing I didn't like about the book is the dialogue, because it felt stilted and unnatural. I don't read a lot of older books so it could be because I'm not used to that. But I think there's potential in a modern adaptation of the book to update that element.",horrorlit

1712174890.0,Review of Devil House by John Darnielle,"I have seldom felt so ill-used by a book.

Some of this can be laid at the feet of marketing because ""horror"" sounds more appealing than ""pseudointellectual navel-gazed larded with vaporous flourishes of elegant, empty nonsense.""  The cover certainly seems to hint at horrors within, with its creepy manse whose shadow looks like a bat and its synopsis that whispers of unfathomable truths slowly, inexorably revealed.  There is no reason to think it's not horror; it's even labeled as such on Goodreads and in library lookup systems.

Except that the only horror on view is the insufferable tedium of Darnielle's obsession with sacrificing the numerous kernels of tantalizing story in favor of showing off his l33t literary skills.  Oh, you thought you were getting a small-town true crime story?  Rube!  Let me jump to this *other* small-town horror story instead.  Oh, you were getting invested in that story?  Gullible dolt!  Have some nonsensical, Old English bafflegab in an eye-watering font instead!  Because I'm smart, see?  Smart enough to know Old English and its narrative conventions!  What a clever boy am I!  

But not smart enough to know the difference between present tense and preterite conjugations in Spanish, alas.  If you're going to be insufferable and grating in the service of flaunting your obvious superiority, you should at least be correct about it.

I *wanted* to like this.  Some of the prose was engrossing and had a dreamy, serene quality, and the hook of an unsolved crime in a small town was catnip.  But there's only so much joy I can take in some pompous doofus prating about his amazing investigatory technique and ability to read people.  Eventually, the story needs to progress, to fulfill the promise made in the early pages, but this one never does.  It just spins in a morass of self-indulgence and peters out like a defective squib.  There are no revelations and certainly no revelations to justify the time sunk into this excursion because...

None of it is true.  It was all made up by Darnielle to make true crime readers feel bad for enjoying true crime book(but writers aren't equally awful for exploiting and profiting off that enjoyment, oh, dear, no).  The mysteries and characters you invested in and waded through 400 pages never existed.  Ha ha!  Don't you feel stupid?  Wasn't I so brilliant?

Twists like this can work if the author has established trust with the reader, and has worked to tell a good story through which to thread his social commentary.  Darnielle did neither of these things; instead, he engaged in egotistic intellectual masturbation for 400 pages and expected us to gawp in awe in the soporific afterglow.

He can shove his pretension where the sun don't shine and hope it passes with the next quinoa smoothie.

1712174053.0,Shirley Jackson is Brilliant,"I just wanted to post to say how brilliant Shirley Jackson is. I’m currently reading The Sundial (no spoilers please!) and it’s excellent. I’ve also read The Haunting of Hill House, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, alongside a couple of her short story collections (The Lottery and Other Short Stories, Dark Tales, and Let Me Tell You).

While I classify her work as horror, it has such a unique character to it. She can build so much unease in apparently ordinary situations. Her characters are all just a bit odd, but it’s difficult to pinpoint what exactly is odd about them. She can build tension so well, and make everyday things feel strange. Her prose is so elegant. All her writing just flows wonderfully. A lot of her writing is very witty too.

1712172376.0,"Finished The Creeper by AM Shine. Um, what was that ending?","Seriously, what? The Creeper is just… a guy? I really didn’t enjoy this book much, and the ending made me laugh out loud. The only creepy element of the book is a guy. Standing there menacingly. This makes no sense. First of all, why does the weird village cult not just kill Starling? Clearly the rules don’t matter since he dies at the end of the book despite not having seen the Creeper, and he is consistently a bother to them. Why keep murdering these random researchers instead of just dealing with the source of the issue? Clearly his continued existence doesn’t matter since, again, they murder him at the request of some dude who wandered in. Secondly, how does this guy know they’re gonna look out the window? Is he just standing in front of the living room glass, hoping they don’t walk to the kitchen? If you see him and don’t tell anyone, and he doesn’t see you see him, how does the legend get enforced?

1712159122.0,Horror that bleeds into reality.,"Just a thought. Nothing too deep. Everyone has their own personal preferences on what is “good horror”…..and I was thinking back on some of the most enjoyable novels I’ve read through the years. Many of them had themes that I could personally identify with at the time of reading. Idk if I even realized the connection at the time, but after looking back, it was definitely there.

For example, I started How To Sell A Haunted House by Grady Hendrix when it first came out. Couldn’t really get into it. About 20% in, stopped. Just wasn’t doing it for me. Fast forward to the present. Mom has passed and Dad is in hospice with a limited amount of time remaining unfortunately. So, I’m looking for something a little lighter than say, Edward Lee as I flew out to see dad and restarted HTSAHH. Absolutely hooked now and I’m sure it’s the similarities between the brother and sister and the deceased parents in the story and the reality that my parents will both be gone (from this plane) soon. I can definitely relate more to the characters and narrative this time around. Just some food for thought. I’m sure many of you have experienced the same thing.

The story itself wasn't necessarily anything original, it was extremely similar to Salem's Lot, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

I just finished Intercepts, and I have to say it was an extremely solid read. I was hooked pretty quickly by the opening, leaving a host of unanswered questions.
One thing to note, I'm not typically the biggest fan of body horror, which this novel is rife with, but it was handled properly and paced well enough that it didn't bother me or feel forced, in my opinion.
 
There are some unique concepts that are utilized in a very clever way, especially towards the latter end of the novel.

Without going into too much detail, the use of a multi-character perspective and a very impactful epilogue elevated this story for me.

I would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a darker story with an original take on the genre.",horrorlit

1712112357.0,Ending of Intercepts: a quick question (spoilers ahead),"**SPOILERS AHEAD**

So I just finished reading Intercepts by T.J. Payne and I have a quick question about the veeeeery ending of the book. It has to do with the last few paragraphs about Mr. Aguirre. 

“Mr. Aguirre had to turn away from that smiling Antenna. The smile unnerved him. He gently set down his tablet, removed his glasses, and tilted his head toward the floor. He reached up
and massaged his temples and then the back of his neck.
Maybe it was from staring at the screen of the smiling Antenna. Maybe it was from too much work and not enough rest. Maybe it was the stress of the job. Whatever it was, a pressure pushed against the back of Mr. Aguirre's eyes.
He hoped it would soon pass because he was experiencing the worst headache of his life.
Strange.”

Does this mean he will eventually become an Antenna himself, he’s being manipulated by Joe (who’s now an Antenna), or is it from a gas leak, like previously happened at Site B? I know I should know the answer but I was hoping to avoid searching back through my kindle and just have one of you lovely people provide me their interpretation.",horrorlit
1712111682.0,Occultation by Laird Barron,"
To start with, I'm gonna say that Laird Barron is probably one of the best horror writers of the modern day and I'm very eager to consume everything else he's written. This collection of short stories was absolutely incredible. I find that Barron's way of crafting plots and building characters is rather roundabout and hypnotizing, which is part of the allure. He clearly takes from a wide variety of influences, from Lovecraft to Bierce to LeFanu, references to whom he makes in many of his stories, along with film references, revealing his erudition and obsession with the horror genre, and if anyone knows me they know I'm a sucker for intertextuality and Easter eggs. I'm gonna go ahead and review each short story one by one. 

1) The Forest: I thought it interesting that Barron started off this collection with what I felt to be his second weakest story. The Forest is by no means bad, but maybe just not my cup of tea, leaning more towards sci-fi than horror. I will say that it had a very filmic feel to it, almost Cronenberg, veering into body horror moreso than true science fiction. It does give you a feel for how Barron writes, his baroque and twisted imagery, his way of skillfully revealing character development rather than just handing it to you, and his tendency to end stories with a metaphor that makes sense thematically but can be confusing if you aren't used to it. Overall a good story. 


2) Occultation: This is what I would call his weakest story in the book. Occultation is more of a sketch than a full on story, which is in contrast to the rest of this book. It's a small piece of prose-poetry that is interesting but nothing more than that. I thought I was being set up for 400 pages that I wouldn't really enjoy more than sporadically, but luckily this turned out not to be the case. 


3) The Lagerstatte: Now this is what I'm talking about. The Lagerstatte is an absolutely incredible story and should be taught to people trying to learn creative writing for its wonderful use of imagery and relentless tone. This story has a much more depressive atmosphere than the rest, which is necessitated by the mental state of the main character, who is under the spell of psychological illness. Her desperation at reaching out for a solution that any level headed person would dismiss as bunk and then the fragmentation of the storyline as her mental state worsens is absolutely phenomenal storytelling. The whole premise is creepy and Barron's way of telling the story is even creepier. 10/10.


4)  Mysterium Tremendum: A very solid story, better than average although not quite as good as the towering one before it. This one has one of my favorite plot devices however, in which a mysterious (and possibly satanic) book found in an old bookstore leads our main characters on a little road trip. It's nice to see gay characters treated completely even-handedly, not as a simple plot device, while still recognizing the realities they faced. The plot here was a bit winding and I found the end a slight letdown after the peak of the plot was overcome, but the peak was extremely good. A nice story, maybe a 7.5.


5) Catch Hell: Dumb title, best story. If The Lagerstatte was a 10, this is an 11. The plot is perfectly suited towards me, showing that Barron can also make a foray into the Gothic, with the setting being a large, creepy mansion in an isolated setting, and the plot being satanic in nature. I don't want to give the whole thing away but the plot is mostly based on a truly iconic horror film, with this one having a delightful twist at the end. I would give this a rating that reflects it as being not only the best in this collection but one of the best modern horror shorts ever written. For me, it surpassed anything by Thomas Ligotti and made me wonder if Laird Barron might not actually be best horror writer of today. That judgements will have to be withheld for now. 


6) Strappado: Less geared towards my personal tastes but a good short story nonetheless. I don't have much to say about this one other than that it was solid, well written, and has another of his metaphorical endings that can be confusing. 7/10.


7) The Broadsword: The plot set up a good story but unfortunately here Barron let us down a bit with the imagery that he had used so skillfully elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, this is still a very good story, but he tended to make more use of common horror images found in film here, which seemed a bit below his level. Nonetheless, it was a nice piece of Lovecraftian horror, and one where the plot is actually the main focus, and so it evened out in the end to be around the same level as the story before it. Truly creepy. 


8) --30--: While this one feels filmic as well, it's in a better way; 30 is like an unhinged 70s horror movie. The plot is revealed piece by piece, making it hard to get a bearing on what's happening at first, but once it gets going it really gets going. This one maybe tries to do a bit too much at once, marrying sci-fi with satanic horror, Lovecraft, and Wes Craven all at once, but it actually succeeds. The plot here is stuffed to the brim, and it truly creates an atmosphere of unraveling and madness. The last act is truly insane. This is wonderful story that really skeeved me out. 


9) Six six six: nice little thriller to end things off. If the story before is a 70s film this one would be early 80s, a bit cheesy but nonetheless entertaining. It really makes you think the story is going in one direction before pulling a complete 180, I'm still not sure how I feel about the ending. One of the weaker stories but I do love the Gothic setting. 


Overall, I am greatly intrigued by this collection of horror stories and already find myself in the camp of saying that Barron is the savior of 21st century horror. Better than Clive Barker by far and at least on the same level as Ligotti, Barron takes influences from a lot more horror than Ligotti does (he being a strict Lovecraftian) and it shows greatly in the stories, even beyond the intertextuality. Barron can be tonally diverse and explore different types of plots, all without losing that voice that makes him who he is. In that way, I'd liken him to Robert Bloch, although he certainly much more unrelenting in his violence and terror, without Bloch's fun sense of humor and camp. 

Overall, I'd say that this collection of short stories is incredible, the great ones making up for the lesser ones, and that it will drive me and anyone else who reads it to pursue his work indefatigably to the very end. Highly recommend.

Here’s the story.

Two weeks ago, my husband surprised me by reaching out to Nathan on social media. Nathan very graciously agreed to meet us when we came to visit Asheville. We met at a local brewery and spent an hour talking about all things literature. I can’t emphasize enough how kind, down-to-earth, empathetic and brilliant Nathan is in person. His mind is like an encyclopedia of literature, and he has such a genuine passion for the craft of writing. Nathan gave me advice for my own writing. And rest assured, I let Nathan know that his prose and his narrative voice are cutting and beautiful, and that his stories are pushing the boundaries of what horror can do for literature.

Nathan was surprised and touched to learn that he has a devoted fanbase on this subreddit!  He sends all of you his love. He told me if there’s enough interest, he would be game for an AMA—maybe in the fall, around the publication date of “Crypt of the Moon Spider."" (I have no idea what’s involved in arranging an AMA…. but if we can’t swing that, maybe we can garner a list of questions to send him instead.)

I know some of you are curious about his upcoming work.  I want to be careful to let Nathan describe his own projects in his own time, BUT I want to share a few exciting things with you.

1. We haven’t read the last of the Hell’s mythos from “Wounds.” Nathan is working on a project set inside that same world—but his priority right now is to focus on his upcoming lunar novellas.
2. That upcoming novella, “Crypt of the Moon Spider,” will certainly be darker and more horror-oriented than his last novel, “The Strange.”
3. I asked Nathan if he’s thought about optioning “The Butcher’s Table” (his most popular work) for a movie or a series. He loves the idea. But the story would need a serious budget or studio behind it. If anyone has any idea how to raise awareness for a project like this—please message me.  Maybe we can work some reddit magic!

Finally, if you’ve ever enjoyed Nathan’s work, or you want to send him some love, please feel free to post below. Let’s give Mr. Ballingrud a very warm welcome to the community.  I’ll make sure he gets a link to this thread!

1712061295.0,Dark Harvest Book vs Movie,"I just finished reading Dark Harvest and I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Even short as it is I love how primal, raw, and smart the protagonists and antagonists are, and how the cycle of abuse and curse continues and comes to an end.

So I wanted to watch the movie to compare. The first half got me not gonna lie. I got why for the movie they changed how October Boy was created, makes it more jarring and artistic than letting a pumpkin grow in clothes. They change Pete into Jim's younger brother Ritchie so the movie can have the brother family angle. And I like how they show the different reactions to teens forced to do the run. 

The one iffy change I was on the fence about was Sawtooth Jack, as he's called in the movie. I got why they wanted to make him into a murder machine for the creature feature aspect and more entertaining deaths, but it loses the fact he was just as much as a victim as they were trying to keep whatever much of humanity he had left to survive the deadly gauntlet. So I was begrudgingly accepting it. 

Then the ending happened and it sucked. The book was short yes but it kept it at a beautiful and satisfying ending of the curse is complete. The Town is destroyed and it felt so justified once you get the whole story. Like cleansing sin. 

The movie tho, man they missed something special. Jack loses. He doesn't reach the church in time, he gets Ritchie to shoot him, marking him the next curse victim. And when he tries to fight and get out of it, the Guild manages to kill him and bury him in the grave anyway. Like, why do this? The dad literally one year later after losing both sons revives Ritchie as Sawtooth Jack and tells him to ""burn it all down"" and the movie just ends. How was any of that satisfying when the cycle is still happening and we somehow Don't see Ritchie's vengeance on the town? The book literally had the town light in a fireball already there, and the movie ignores it because I guess it wasn't depressing enough. 

Overall for me, I like some changes they did and style choices, not all, but man that ending killed any redemption it could've had. 

Anyone else seen this movie? What are your thoughts, either as is or vs the book? Ever disappointed by a movie adaptation for other books?

1712060585.0,Tampa by Alissa Nutting,"Tagged NSFW for the book topic. I have been reading horror for a long time. As with movies, horror novels have never made me feel anything. I grew up through 4chan's popularity and like a lot of people, saw the random threads of beheadings on the b board and whatnot. Never have I ever felt so much as a stomach twist. This was different. It's a story from someone who had went to high school with a female pedophile school teacher. This teacher received 4 years probation, a slap on the wrist compared to what she would have received if she hadn't been a woman and also a woman with good looks. This book shook me. It is written with visceral detail, and comes across dramatic for the sake of drawing attention to female pedophiles. But after seeing the interview of whom this book was based upon, I can say wholeheartedly that the level of callous and degeneracy shown by this character is well within the realm of normalcy for her real life equivalent. I could one hundred percent see this book as an alternative timeline in which this character's real life counterpart Debra Lefave had committed every vile action. The depravity and pure evil of it all is enough that I will be retiring from reading for some time. I really recommend this if you want to read something that will make you feel a sense of impending doom, or if you are a parent and want to feel more educated on the mindsets of these dispicable monsters that often hide in plain sight. This book is honestly changing",horrorlit
1712051098.0,All The Fiends Of Hell by Adam Nevill has been released today,"A lot of his novels have been criticised in part because he can sometimes struggle to land the endings. I don't think these criticisms are without merit, although for the most part I enjoy his work despite this (House of Small Shadows was a chore imo). However his last 2 novels have been brilliantly paced and consistent from beginning to end, perhaps in part because they've been shorter with less filler.

With this in mind, I'm incredibly excited to read this post-apocalyptic story. Especially after he did the pre-apocalypse so well with Lost Girl (my favourite Nevill novel).

What are your thoughts on this release?

As a side note, it's a good month for horror as CJ Tudor's new novel releases in about 2 weeks.",horrorlit
1712048888.0,Brief review: Nevill's No One Gets Out Alive,"I appreciated the stitching together of a (largely) realistic thriller onto a ghost story onto a substrate of juicy weird-fiction folk horror.  Commenters here often critique Nevill for abrupt changes in tone, pacing, or perceived quality of story over the course of his novels, I think generally rather fairly.  Interestingly, I think he makes such a tonal shift work to make the story stronger or at least more memorable in this piece.

&#x200B;

I found the atmosphere and visuals satisfyingly evocative.  Both the interior emotional life of the viewpoint character and the exteriors such as appearance of antagonists and the setting of the boarding house were vividly crafted.  For a small, claustrophobic, and narrowly-circumscribed story, Nevill gets a lot of bang from attention to grotesque detail.

&#x200B;

The pacing was peculiar, maybe deliberately so.  The first half of the novel was almost painfully deliberate and really even repetitive, so much so that I had a hard time maintaining interest.  Then, abruptly, when the first critical plot pivot drops, the story suddenly accelerates and maintains that intensity to the very end.   The denouement is more of a whimper than a bang, but it feels appropriate and organic.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, Nevill does his best work with the palette of folk horror.  *The Ritual*, *The Reddening*, and  *Cunning Folk* all feature some of his best and most memorable writing when he's engaging with the tropes of folk horror, and at times I think he finds a common thread between folk horror and cosmic horror that is even more striking.  In *No One Gets Out Alive*,  there's a bit of backbone of folk horror notes to create a feeling of worldbuilding and depth, but I would have liked more.

&#x200B;

So, in summary:  A slow burn to start and the frequently found first-half-versus-second-half common to several of Nevill's pieces.  A fully realized, immersive tour into a truly hellish setting and circumstance.  The urgency and envelopment of the second portion of the novel are worth the setup, and the visuals (and olfactories!) will live a little longer in the memory than many novels can provide.",horrorlit

Nell and Theo go on a walk at night and somehow end up running into a family picnic where Theo sees something so horrible it almost drives her mad. What are everyone’s theories?! What did she see? Was the family an echo of one of the families who had passed through the house? A warped version of a family memory from Theo? Just another trick of the house? Excerpt below: 

The path led them to its destined end and died beneath their feet. Eleanor and Theodora looked into a garden, their eyes blinded with the light of sun and rich color; incredibly, there was a picnic party on the grass in the garden. They could hear the laughter of the children and the affectionate, amused voices of the mother and father; the grass was richly, thickly green, the flowers were colored red and orange and yellow, the sky was blue and gold, and one child wore a scarlet jumper and raised its voice again in laughter, tumbling after a puppy over the grass. There was a checked tablecloth spread out, and, smiling, the mother leaned over to take up a plate of bright fruit; then Theodora screamed. “Don’t look back,” she cried out in a voice high with fear, “don’t look back—don’t look—run!”",horrorlit

It's such a quick, engaging read. I generally stay away from dystopian novels because I think the genre is trite, but the concept of this one had me hooked. 

Above anything , I think *Tender* accomplishes the most important thing that any horror book can and the reason I am (we are?) obsessed with the genre. The novel leaves you with a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach. A combination of disgust, incredulousness, fascination, guilt, and a sense of dread. It also leaves you with a sense of intrigue, aw and perhaps a sick sense of pleasure.

It's the first book in awhile that really reminds me of Edmund Burke's concept of the sublime and true terror that leaves you stunned, appreciative and difficult to go back to normal life.

For context Demonic's Left Turn moment is when you find out that the serial killer bad guy isn't going to just die like a normal guy. 

Another example for me was the moment in Berserk where the demon Zodd is introduced. The story was a military/war/politcal drama right up until like 300 dudes run into a castle and get slaughtered by a single guy.

In the order that I read them this year up until the end of March:

***

### [The Wolf's Hour](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11551.The_Wolf_s_Hour) - Robert McCammon

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐½

This one was sitting in my TBR for a long time, intimidating me in its thickness. I wasn't sure how well I could handle a story about a werewolf superspy. As it turned out, I loved it. McCammon split the narrative into two timelines which show the MC being turned into a wolf and then growing into his strength, while the other takes place during WW2 as he seeks to thwart a Nazi ploy that would secure the war for them.

*Recommended for: Lovers of werewolves and/or lovers of historical WW2 horror*

****

### [The Peabody-Ozymandias Traveling Circus and Oddity Emporium](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289254-the-peabody-ozymandias-traveling-circus-and-oddity-emporium) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐

Last year I went on a massive [F Paul Wilson](https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/187gamx/f_paul_wilsons_adversary_cycle_repairman_jack/) binge and read through a large portion of his work. This is a little extension to his ""Secret History of the World"" mythos. It was a fun story, but I'm not sure how easily it'd be approachable for people without this context.

*Recommended for: Mainly FPW fans, but also people seeking freakshow style cosmic horror*

***

### [Dead Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/988783.Dead_Sea) - Tim Curran

### ⭐⭐⭐

You know all those [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/14wmdys/ultimate_compendium_of_oceanicunderwater_request/) where people ask for oceanic cosmic horror? Well this is **exactly** the book they're asking for. I enjoyed it, but the reason it doesn't score higher is because it was just so needlessly long and became a bit of a slog to get through.

*Recommended for: Oceanic and cosmic horror lovers*

***

### [Cold City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13539179-cold-city) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

The start of a prequel trilogy for FPW's iconic Repairman Jack character. While Jack's later escapades are supernatural and rise to the level of universal cosmic horror, these ones are more grounded in things like mob warfare, terrorism, and child trafficking. This notwithstanding, I still really enjoyed it.

*Recommended for: People who've read Repairman Jack or people who really like urban thrillers*

***

### [Trouble With Lichen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91097.Trouble_with_Lichen) - John Wyndham

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐½

I *love* John Wyndham and stand by the claim that he's the most underappreciated author in horror literature. He's the father of apocalyptic fiction and one of the early voices in dystopian fiction. What's more, his prose is extremely approachable even by modern standards, unlike most writing prior to ~1970 that tends to be super dry. Trouble With Lichen is an excellent exploration of the dystopia that would occur if technology was discovered that could lengthen human life into the centuries, however production was severely limited. 

*Recommended for: Lovers of dystopian fiction*

***

### [Dark City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16163783-dark-city) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐½

Book two in the Early Repairman Jack trilogy. More of the same from the first book, more of Jack becoming Jack.

*Recommended for: People who've read Repairman Jack or people who really like urban thrillers*

***

### [The Dark Half](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11597.The_Dark_Half) - Stephen King

### ⭐⭐

I've long said to people that King's golden era was pre-1990 and that everything he'd written during this time was a guaranteed banger. The Dark Half is the exception. This book kind of sucked. It's an allegory to King being outed as Bachman. The plot is around an author whose penname manifests as a poltergeist and starts going on a rampage. While King isn't traditionally known for his endings, this one takes on a whole new level of bad.

*Recommended for: Diehard King fans who just need to read everything he's written, just read most of his other stuff first*

***

### [Fear City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518868-fear-city) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Conclusion to the Early Repairman Jack trilogy. More of the same, building up to Jack's role in thwarting the real-life terrorist attacks that occurred in New York in the 90s.

*Recommended for: People who've read Repairman Jack or people who really like urban thrillers*

***

### [Ticktock](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/959409.Ticktock) - Dean Koontz

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

I've read a lot of Koontz in the past and my experience with him is how hit-or-miss he is. This one had been in my pile for a long time and I kind of had to force myself to read it, but in the end I enjoyed it quite a lot. One of his better works. Starts with a killer doll that hunts the main character and escalates from there in increasingly fun and wacky ways. 

*Recommended for: Campy as hell supernatural horror from the class of 80s horror juggernauts*

***

### [Fix](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51799078-fix) - JA Konrath, Ann Voss Peterson, F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐

Konrath and Peterson write a cheesy spy series called Codename Chandler. This book is part of that world, but it crosses over with Wilson's Repairman Jack character which is why I read it. It was a pretty fun (and I repeat, cheesy) story, but it's not something I'd have read if not for Jack's involvement.

*Recommended for: Cheesy spy thrillers*

### [Allhallows Eve](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145160.Allhallow_s_Eve) - Richard Laymon

### ⭐⭐

Another that had been in my TBR for a long time and another author that's very hit-or-miss. It was a very easy read that followed Laymon's usual tropes of stupid, unlikeable, horny characters. But the conclusion was just... crap... Like it built up for 249 pages and then ended abruptly in the 250th. 

*Recommended for: Cheesy slasher fans*

### [Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33507.Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea) - Jules Verne

### ⭐⭐½

More sci-fi/adventure, but still a fun read. Similar to my comment about John Wyndham, it's amazing how easy to read Jules Verne is considering how long ago it was written. Not only that, but considering it was translated too. Reads almost modern, and it's amazing how much of a futurist Verne was and how much he actually got right that was mere sci-fi at the time. Biggest issue with this though, is that there's essentially no plot. Stuff just happens until it stops happening. No conflict, no resolution, just stuff.

*Recommended for: Fans of the classics, fans of sci-fi and adventure*

### [Cabal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/103035.Cabal) - Clive Barker

### ½

Ironically, it was Barker that got me back into reading a few years back with his Abarat series. It was just such a chill and easy read. But since then, I've tried two others by him (Imajica and Cabal) and DNF'd both of them for the same reasons. Here in Cabal the progression of events and character actions is just so nonsensical that I don't know how I'm supposed to take them seriously, much less enjoy them. I typed up a fair bit more here which I ended up deleting because I was fairly harshly critical of the ""plot"", best to leave it unsaid.

*Recommended for: Nobody really, though if you must, then fans of second-world fantasy who can handle ridiculous contrivances*

### [Midnight Mass](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219417.Midnight_Mass) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

It's a great testament to FPW that he kept me wrapped up for thirty-something books in his connected universe before I made it to this standalone masterpiece. It was basically written for me and my tastes. Evil vampires combined with the apocalypse? Yes please. Don't be confused to think it has anything to do with the show either, despite the show borrowing heavily from it (vampires, strong religious plot, and many of the same character archetypes).

*Recommended for: Vampire lovers, apocalypse lovers, fans of religious themes*

### [Feed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7094569-feed) - Mira Grant

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

I'm openly not the biggest zombie fan, but I have liked Mira Grant in the past and this one was one of the more unique takes on the genre. It's set 25 years after the zombie apocalypse, but now they've got it tentatively under control and are trying to go about their lives in a zombie world. Like The Walking Dead, everybody is infected, so zombies are just a way of life in the world. It follows journalises who are trailing a presidential campaign and who uncover a big government conspiracy in the process.

*Recommended for: Zombie fans, dystopian and post-apocalyptic fans*

### [Deadline](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8429687-deadline) - Mira Grant

### ⭐⭐½

Book two of Mira Grant's Newsflesh trilogy. This one suffers in much the same way that the second book of her Parasitology trilogy did. It was basically just filler to pad out a trilogy. Same plot and themes as above.

*Recommended for: As above*

***

### [Blackout](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11806716-blackout) - Mira Grant

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Conclusion to the Newsflesh trilogy and a return to form after the disappointing second entry.

*Recommended for: As above*

### [Empire of the Damned](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126918599-empire-of-the-damned) - Jay Kristoff

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Sequel to his Empire of the Vampire from a couple of years ago which I loved. I really enjoyed this one too, but it did have a couple of things with the narrative style that got on my nerves. Still looking forward to the finale though.

*Recommended for: Vampire lovers and people seeking high fantasy horror*

***

### [The Fifth Harmonic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6139032-the-fifth-harmonic) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐

This was a curious little novel. MC is a doctor who comes down with aggressive cancer and seeks alternative treatment. Ends up on a spiritual adventure through Central America doing all sorts of new agey stuff. It was a perfectly middling book. Didn't love it, but the pages kept turning.

*Recommended for: People into spiritual healing and alternative medicine with a side of adventure/fantasy*

***

### [Sinkhole](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50029116-sinkhole) - April A Taylor

### ⭐⭐½

Been really enjoying indie authors lately and I read this whole short book in a day. Really cool concept where the Earth essentially revolts against humanity with natural disasters and animals becoming bloodthirsty. This said, I feel like the author didn't know where to go with it, because the ending was terrible.

*Recommended for: Apocalyptic lovers and eco-horror lovers*

***

### [Intercepts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45868683-intercepts) - TJ Payne

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Another indie author, another great book. This time I loved it all the way through and I read this one in only a couple of days too. The concept has been done before, think Minority Report or The Institute where people are used as conduits for espionage, but this one had a really fun take on things from there which I won't spoil further. Seriously though, anyone on the fence with indie authors needs to give them a shot because I'm finding so much great stuff.

*Recommended for: Human experimentation horror fans*

### [The Watchers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58321103-the-watchers) - AM Shine

### ⛔

Okay so anyone who's followed my posts probably knows by now that I'm very forgiving of bad writing because I consider the story to hold 99% of the importance in a... story... with the writing simply the delivery mechanism. This one though... the writing made me DNF within 50 pages. And within those 50 pages I probably suffered through 200+ similes that served no purpose. It felt like a student trying to extend their word count for an assignment. Just couldn't do it.

Is it the long form novel, or an author demonstrating a diverse range of stories and talents in one collection?

It gives authors less time to screw up a story, and if they tank it you are less invested emotionally and in time spent. Reading collections of short stories makes me feel pretty accomplished. 

2/3 of my favorite authors excel in the short form (Brian Evenson and Laird Barron). 

As a metric, I’ve finished 11 books this year. 7 were short story collections, 2 were novellas, and 2 were novels. Most of the stuff in my TBR that I am most excited about are collections, and I seem to keep moving them to the top of the pile.

1711875350.0,My beef with Michael McDowell's Blackwater Saga,"This post won't contain any spoilers beyond themes and genre.

Michael McDowell's Blackwater Saga was published in 6 short volumes (each <200 pages); its narrative spanning the years 1919 to the late 1960s in Perdido, Alabama.

The saga is regularly described as both horror and southern gothic. There's no need to define horror to this audience, but Gothic as a genre tends to deal with the anxiety and anticipation around archaic power structures fading away, whether religious (Lewis' The Monk or Radcliffe's The Italian), Feudal (The Castle of Otranto or the Mystery of Udolpho), or, in the case of Southern Gothic, slave-economy, which is often explored with post-civil war families decaying in the wake of abolition and the waning cotton trade (the decrepit plantation houses of Faulkner, or the painful integration of Flannery O'Connor).

Blackwater is not Southern Gothic. In fact, for first 90% of the novel has the Caskey's going from strength to strength, success to success, regardless of post slavery economics, two world wars, a great depression, and civil rights movements. Nothing touches them, and without going into spoilers, the ending does not set up a grand Fall, nor an accountability for their social position.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say it has an offensively revisionist view of race, sexuality, and gender norms, given the time period it's set it. It seems nearly everbody is fine with being whoever they want to be and who they want to be with, and in the 50 year span of the saga, the black servant family is never raised as a question of ethics or evolves in any way.  Every generation is just so gosh darn eager to serve the Caskey's, coz they good folks.

On a line-by-line basis the saga is competently written; I wouldnt have finished it otherwise. The characters are each unique, but the 3rd person omniscient narration is more detached than usual, and entire years are breezed over in the same historical prose as the actual action, and makes investment in the drama difficult to achieve. As for the horror elements...? I'm personally convinced that they were a late addition to the drafting of the saga and that the series would have been improved by more ambiguity; as it is, the horror elements pop up occasionally like a jack in the box, disappear, and barely affect the continued plot.

I can't say that I *hated* it; as mentioned before, I wouldn't have read a book this long, over 3 months, if that were so. But every element of it was so neutered and undercooked that by the ending, I was pretty underwhelmed by what McDowell had to say about 50 years of Alabama society, where his foreword denoted that his aim was to ""describe the people as they *are*"".

A disappointment, to be sure, given my love of both Horror and Southern Gothic.

1711857238.0,Problems with the Horror Genre?,"We all love horror here, definitely no doubt about that, but that doesn't mean there's no criticism to be had. I think as horror lovers, we're some of the best people *to* criticize the genre, really. We know what makes horror *horror*, and in turn, we understand the nuances of the genre better than non-readers of horror. This also means we would understand the whys of what things fall flat. Of course, this is all subjective anyway, but there are popular and unpopular trends. This is what I'm curious about - what sorts of things have you noticed as trends in horror that you don't enjoy or have active problems with?

I'll be honest, the main reason I'm writing this post is to rant about my gripes with ableism in the genre. I read a book recently that I found really tense, but the underlying ableism of the way the antagonist was described really took me out of it. I'm disabled myself - though not physically - so it really irks me when horror writers fall back on those tropes because they're not realistic a lot of the time, and they tend to paint people with disabilities as monsters, which feels really shitty. The book I read in particular had the antagonist be physically disabled, and described him as ""mangled"" and ""disfigured"" or ""malformed"". It felt like the author was trying to invoke feelings of disgust in me because of the character's physical disabilities instead of the heinous shit he did (although they try to disgust you that way too, I just thought the disability part was needlessly pronounced). The writer also thought it'd be fun to include the trope of the character with psychosis/schizophrenia being ""dangerous"", which I just feel like does more harm than good, even if that made the narrator more unreliable, which I find engaging. If they'd found another way to make the narrator unreliable, I'd have less of a gripe about it. I just find it to be a shame because disregarding these elements, I did actually enjoy the book.

While this isn't a problem unique to horror (I've found thrillers are bad for it too), I do find it more pronounced than in other genres. I'm sure there are plenty of books that do it right, and plenty of horror written by disabled people themselves, but I don't find that to be the case the majority of the time.

1711824379.0,Briardark - A stunning debut that reads like Missing411 meets Twilight Zone,"Howdy folks! Long time lurker, first time poster -- this novel is too good not to gush about.

**Elevator pitch**: Ever go down one of those r/AskReddit rabbit holes with a subjects like, ""What's your true story Twilight Zone moment?"" or ""Tell me about your favorite unsolved, real-world mystery"" ? (If not, [you should](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/95bsre/seriouseerie_towns_disappearing_diners_and_creepy/).) S.A. Harian's *Briardark* is a beautifully-written, novel-length journey down just that sort of rabbit hole.

Please, allow me to convince you.

\----

**Some housekeeping notes**:

Some discussion here has already questioned whether this counts as ""horror"" (vs. paranormal mystery). In my opinion, horror has three components: 

(a) It does not need to be scary, but it does need to horrify;

(b) It is an allegory, or else it contains allegory;

(c) It is fundamentally tension-driven (in the same way that soul music is fundamentally rhythm-driven, as opposed to melody or harmony driven.)

*Briardark* meets all those criteria. It is also creepy with some truly disturbing moments, even if there's little in the way of the creeping-dread feel one would expect from, say, *'Salem's Lot*.

\----

**Spoiler-Free Review**

*Briardark* begins with a flashback (or is it?) to the disappearance of five hikers in a poorly-charted wilderness area somewhere in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Several years later, a science team from CalTech hikes into the same wilderness area on a climate study of a receding glacier.

The weirdness builds gradually from here. Satellite phones that can't make calls, trails that appear and disappear overnight, plants that shouldn't be there... Atmospherically, this plays out like *Annihilation*, but without the constraint of being told through a journal.

Scene cut. New character -- an IT professional at Oregon State University is tasked with purging data from a collection of hard-drives when he stumbles across an audio recording of an expedition to the depths of the Sierra Nevada mountains. The speaker mentions the death of a colleague, a colleague who, in the other narrative frame, is still very much alive...

These three narrative threads dance around one another in such a way that the reader can't quite tell what happened when. And by the time you start to figure out how all these pieces fit together -- well, I'd rather not spoil it :)

\----

**Comparisons**

Personally, the way I discover new stories is by looking for what is similar to stories I've already enjoyed. Some notable comparisons to other stories I rate 5/5 :

&#x200B;

|Story in comparison|Similarities|Differences|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fringe (TV Show)|Tone (alternatingly light and dramatic -- full enough to capture the wide range of human experience), intrigue, vaguely mystical science fiction, ""is there some deeper plot beneath this?""|No government conspiracies; a little more fantastical than science fictional.|
|Annihilation (Jeff Vandermeer)|Creepy wilderness shit; invisible barriers separating ""our world"" from the creepy wilderness shit; vaguely apocalyptic undertone; vaguely cli-fi.|Characters in Briardark are more like people you know in your actual life, as opposed to the traumatized plot-kites Jeff writes. |
|The Fisherman (John Langan)|Otherworldly eldritch mystery. Heavy themes of unresolved grief, loss, and mental health.|Briardark is way ""lighter."" The Fisherman reads like it's Literary Fiction, and carries the same somberness. The darkness in The Fisherman is therefore much more personal and much more menacing. |
|The Hollow Places (T Kingfisher)|A world behind a veil. Normal people from normal, relatable lives struggling to comprehend the horrors they've stumbled into.|Briardark is much darker, and the stakes are much higher. The characters really marinate in the horror of the world they're stuck in, whereas Kingfisher characters are given the space to still worry about phone calls from their nagging ex, etc.|

&#x200B;

\----

**Some Potential Icks**

Everyone has their own icks (things that make a story ""not work"" for them.) This story really worked for me, but the things I found that you might not like:

\- It's very contemporary. The ""background"" story concerning the disappearing hikers is represented through a mixture of cutaways to chapters from a book about their disappearance, references to one of the disappeared's YouTube channels, and occasionally also to reddit posts about said mystery. (All fictional, of course.) Some folks don't want to read fake reddit threads in their eldritch mystery novels, and that's fair.

\- The characters are more well-rounded and relatable, but their agency is somewhat constrained. This is a complaint I often see. It didn't bother me, personally, because how much agency would a geomorphology professor have if they suddenly found themselves in a world like Stranger Things' ""Upside Down""? I'd shit myself and not know what to do, personally.

\----

**Checklist Items**

&#x200B;

|Content Warnings|Mental health (insanity). Bugs. Death, somewhat graphic but not tediously so. Religious overtones (very light -- references to a cult, a character who left a fundamentalist faith). |
|:-|:-|
|Representation|Cast is \~60% female. Multiple queer characters (no trans or nonbinary characters, though the author uses she/they pronouns, so I don't think this is an intentional omission, and it's a small cast anyway.) Racially diverse, but race isn't an important dimension to the characters' arcs/backgrounds. |
|Bechdell Test|Passes with flying colors. The most developed relationship is between two women leading a science team.|
|Resolved or cliffhangered?|Very much cliffhangered. But the next novel is in progress, and the author posts revision status updates on their IG.|

1711822659.0,Daisy Darker - Alice Feeney,"After reading/really enjoying Rock Paper Scissors, I was told by many that Daisy Darker was their favorite by Feeney so I had to check it out. 

I immediately caught onto the fact that Daisy was dead while she was telling the story. It was quite obvious due to the lack of acknowledgement and response she received from her family. I also kept thinking, “please don’t be Trixie, please don’t be Trixie” because I’m pretty tired of the unsuspecting child killer trope… and as soon as the agent said he would read a book about her if she wrote one, I knew it was the book I was reading lol. 

However, despite all of the accurate predictions I made it kept me invested the entire time and really surprised me! There were far more twists than I foresaw and it was really creative how everything fell together. I still think I like Rock Paper Scissors better tho. ;)

1711811483.0,Monstrilio - Gerardo Sámano Córdova,"Just finished reading Monstrilio this evening and had some thoughts. Spoilers ahead and please excuse any poor formatting and my outpouring of thoughts.

For me, this book reminded me a lot of The Babadook, for its themes of physical manifestations of grief. I also got Pet Semetary vibes. 

In the first part of the book, I found Magos' character to be very interesting and compelling. The way she handled grief entirely differently to her husband, the way she acted coldly but also would play his buttons to try and illicit a reaction. I found it an interesting exploration of the way people (particularly women) can experience grief in different ways, which can come across as offputting to others. Being Aussie, this sort of reminded me at times of the way poor Lindy Chamberlain was vilified by the media for not outwardly expressing her grief. Then if course there is the absolute insanity that is her mutilation of Santiago's corpse and harvesting of his lung.

Jackie sort of reminds me of Jud from Pet Semetary in the way she tells Magos the story of growing someone back from the dead using body parts, but then immediately being like ""oh but you better not do it lol."" I could see no logical reason for her doing this, beyond some sort of Wendigo-style manipulation as Jud was presumably under. Either that or she's just a certified silly goose.

As the story progresses and as character perspectives changed, I feel like certain character elements were lost, diluted, or seemingly evolved into different people entirely. Magos as an artist for me didn't feel like the same person from the start of the book. She is also a genuinely unlikeable character and I struggle to find redeeming qualities.

I enjoyed Lena's character thoroughly and found she was well written. Her motivations to me made sense and I also felt like her reactions were always pretty believable. She certainly felt the most ""real"" to me. 

Joseph to me was a bit of a boring character, however I did enjoy him most during M's Monstrilio phase.

And then there is the monster himself, M! I found this concept to be really interesting. His phases were so novel to me, and I particularly enjoyed his Monstrilio phase. I found him positively adorable but also so bittersweet - especially when he'd have to be locked up or punished for the act of feeding. When he called Joseph ""Papi"" for the first time I wanted to cry, haha.

M is such an interesting take on personified grief to me. Magos first is the one to nurture him and feeds him, like someone holding onto an unhealthy obsession with the past. Others find this harmful, revolting, and it physically causes harm to some. She uses him to lure Joseph back to her despite their marriage breakdown, manipulating their trauma-bond.

M in the latter half of the book is intriguing. He evolves past being a dumb animal and becomes the fully fledged being that he is. Animalistically in tune with his desires and able to scent fear and lust as well as to physically absorb memories from meat including his own lung in the case of Santiago. I mostly see him as an exploration of supressed desires both sexual and violent. I also read him through the lens of being perhaps on the autism spectrum. This might be a slightly shallow or reductionist observation, but I enjoyed how there was little serious injury or death inflicted to female characters, nor was there sexual exploitation of female characters, given its prevalence in the genre.

I found it a little odd that pretty much every single character in this book ends up gay either explicitly or by implication, but then again I have never thought twice when reading a book and everyone is straight! Additionally it would make sense to be more prevalent if that is common amongst your social circle, I guess. This didn't detract from my enjoyment of course, just an observation. 

I absolutely adore the cover art and design of this book, as well as the little Monstrilio drawing on the author info section. 

In summary, I feel there could have been some slightly better character realisation. I enjoyed the prose and pacing of the novel, and also enjoyed the LGBT representation. I didn't get any misogynistic vibes and feel the female characters were mostly written quite well. I will certainly read any other works out forward by the author in future.

For me, this would be a 4.25/5 

I would love to hear other's thoughts!

1. Gage biting Rachel when she's breastfeeding him as they drive upto the house. 

This moment becomes horrific considering that he eventually cannibalizes her at the end. 

2. Gage getting stung by a bee.

1711802687.0,"Cujo, what the hell was that?","I heard King was writing a sequel to Cujo in his upcoming short story collection coming out in May. Since I'd never read it and saw the movie many, many years ago I decided to check it out. It was not what I expected. Here are some of my thoughts.
1. There is this whole sub story about a monster living in the main character's kid's closet. It's not in his imagination, it's real. It comes out and talks shit to the kid or just generally freaks him out. It says it used to be a serial killer cop named Frank Dodd before it died (a villain from The Dead Zone). I found this to be the best part of the book. Creepy-ass unsettling scenes with this thing. It was legit scary. 
2. This book is pretty woke for 1981 (not a bad thing). The 2 main characters are both women. One cheats on her husband and kind of blames him for it. The other is in an abusive marriage. She is trying to find a way to leave her husband with her son without him finding out or possibly killing her. There is a sort of women liberation theme here (once again, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I just didn't expect it).
3. This book is way too long. It would have made an excellent short story. The last half drags even though that's when all of the action happens. The ""trapped in the car scene "" lasts too long and loses it's tension, which was a shame because it could have been incredibly intense. 
4. This book is way, way more sad than scary. There are a lot of parts from Cujo's perspective. You see how rabies changes him and drives him slowly insane. Cujo was a good dog before he got rabies, I found this kind of tragic. And then there is the end. I give King credit for having the balls to write it. 
**Ending Spoiler**
The woman that cheats on her husband 
(Donna) and her 4 year old son (tad) are trapped in the car for several days in the summer heat. This poor kid has seizures from heat stroke and he eventually dies. It's incredibly sad. Donna has a mental breakdown when rescue finally arrives. It's all very heartbreaking and then boom, the book is over. I don't know how to feel about it. Part of me likes it because it's not a ""saved at the last seconds everything will be alright"" Hollywood ending. But, yikes, real bleak and tragic. Hard to like that kind of ending. 

Cujo surprised me. A lot of unexpected stuff. I don't think it was a great book, but it wasn't bad either. I'm curious what the sequel will be about. Hopefully the Frank Dodd monster. I feel like there is a lot more story there.",horrorlit

1711789505.0,Horror / Dark Stories Featuring Prominent Overpowered or Powerful Characters,"This feels like something I should ask elsewhere because I'm unsure how prominent this is in horror stories, but I have a preference for this genre so I'm giving it a shot here.

I love stories involving characters that are extremely powerful. I'm the person who likes Mary Sues, though I'm not looking for characters that are loved by all and seen as doing no wrong (unless that's part of the horror). I just find it very interesting when a character has that much power. There's a lot to be said about how they see themselves and how others see them. Their power can make them an enemy, a desired ally, a god, a monster.

I'm specifically looking for stories where these characters or scenes are prominent. So, not a character who shows up once, does something cool, then never comes back. I'm thinking of main characters and supporting characters, including antagonists. I'd also prefer to not have to wait until the very end for something impressive to happen. I am, however, fine with buildups leading to a series of increasing power.

Tropes and themes I LOVE

* Body horror
* Psychological horror
* Surrealism
* Cosmic horror (Please do not suggest me Lovecraft. Aside from other things, I just don't like his writing.)
* Reality warping
* Psychic abilities (specifically telekinesis)
* Warped sense of morality or corruption of morality

What I prefer to avoid

* Historical settings
* Sexual violence, ESPECIALLY against minors
* Heavy bigotry (racism, homophobia, transphobia)

Some examples of stories where prominent characters display extreme power:

* A Light Most Hateful by Hailey Piper
* The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins
* The Dreamer Trilogy by Maggie Stiefvater
* The Scholomance Series by Naomi Novik
* The Locked Tomb Series by Tamsyn Muir
* Allison by Jeff Strand
* Firestarter by Stephen King
* Middlegame by Seanan McGuire
* It's a Good Life by Jerome Bixby
* Hench by Natalie Zina Walschots (It was just one part, but, wow. It made an impact.)
* The Poppy War by R.F. Kuang (I liked the first book, hated the second book, then dropped the series.)

There was a book that interested me that I forgot the name of, where the main character developed psychic abilities that essentially made him a god and went around using that with increasingly warped morality... but the book had so many kinds of bigotry (it was impressive, really) that I had to drop it. If not for that, it would have been perfect for me.

I'm not against comics and manga either. I know those are filled with powerful characters when looking into superpowers and shounen. I struggle to keep up with comics however, so while I'll take those suggestions, I'm less likely to get to them.",horrorlit
1711787022.0,Was anyone shocked by this scene from George R R Martin’s “Fevre Dream”?,"I could stomach lots of things when it comes to horror, but I gotta admit I was shocked by this.

So I picked up “Fevre Dream” thinking “cool a vampire story by the guy behind game of thrones”. Sound interesting alright. So i get to this part of the novel where the main villain kills a baby.

Now I know game of thrones is no stranger to baby deaths, but technically they don’t tend to be very descriptive and are often described “offscreen”.  I wasn’t freaking expecting an entire page dedicated to describing how this baby gets his hand lobbed off, how it just frails about crying in pain and then gets his skull crushed.

My last question was answered so quickly and so successfully, I'm going to present another, which I fear may not be as easy to answer. It is one of my holy grails...

Somewhere back in the '70s (between 1970-and 1977, and probably closest to 1974-1975 +/-2 years) I read a short-short SF/Horror story in one of the little free magazines that we sometimes received in school from Scholastic and possibly other sources.

One day a friend showed me a story in their copy of one of these little magazines (it was more or less digest sized) that I had missed because I was out sick (so this was probably in the winter? it explains why I never had my own copy though). The narrator of the story is a child attending another child's birthday party in the future (at least in the future as perceived from the mid-'70s), and bringing a special gift made in the lab in which his/her father worked (I can't remember with any certainty the gender of either the narrator or the recipient of the gift, though I think the recipient might have been a girl).

The gift is a little box or cube, and a string or cord extends out of a hole on one side of the box. When the recipient of the gift pulls on the string, the string pulls back. A delightful tug-of-war ensues, until suddenly whatever is on the other side of the string pulls so hard the birthday girl(?) is drawn into the hole and disappears inside the box. Possibly followed by screams and/or crunching/eating sounds...

The climactic line of the story was something close to ""I forgot the monster on the other side of the nowhere-hole could pull back.""

I also distinctly remember a rather spoilery illustration of a monster accompanying the story. The image (which appears in blue ink in my memory) was a frontal depiction of a ragged and vicious-looking humanoid monster with a fibrous cord extending from the tip of one of its claws.

I have searched in vain for this story for 40 years, and will be genuinely indebted to anyone who can ID it and/or help me locate a copy. THANK YOU!

After I posted this query here, I shared a version on my Facebook page as well, and several friends stated that they too remembered this story. One of them was able to add the following details, all of which fit my memory:

""The scientist/parent was the child's mother. After a few back and forth pulls on the ""string"" the birthday boy made the mistake of wrapping the string around his hand, then yanking really hard. All the party attendees heard his screams after the birthday boy was pulled into the box.

1711727959.0,Johnny Got His Gun - Horror?,"So Metallica's powerful video for their song, One, introduced me to Johnny Got His Gun. I read the book and, while I know it is an anti-war story, the idea of being only a conscious mind, trapped inside your own head, is truly horrifying to me. He recounts WWI stories that are also horrible in their own right. I saw the video today for the first time in a while, and it kind of punched me in the feels. 

Ultimately, the book is sad, and full of despair and dread. I recently spent several days sedated on paralytics in the ICU, and I was still somewhat conscious of what was going on around me. That was bad enough. I know JGHG is about the horrors of war, but I realize it's kind of a straight horror novel in terms of atmosphere. Have you read it? What are your thoughts?",horrorlit

I wasn’t sure what to expect. I wasn’t sure if it would be ghosts, or like haunting, body gore or what. What i found is what i’m calling “real life horror” for lack of knowing a better word. stuff that could actually happen to you. it’s about 200 odd pages and i read it in a day bc once i started it i wanted to piece together the mystery of the main character but when i finished it i felt slighted almost. it took me about an hour of thinking after i finished to decide that i like the book. i like that it doesn’t all wrap up into some perfectly assembled puzzle. in reference to the book the story is like the perfectly written letter for the balloon project. it made perfect sense until the water was spilled on it. that’s pretty much how his memory is. the narrator is unreliable i feel like but i would be too. and the attachment at the end was 🤯

I'll be honest...a lot of the current recommended horror has left me underwhelmed (Edenville DNF, Bunny was unique and highly readable but undercooked, TOGI was absolutely terrific in the first half, lost me in the second, Our Wives Under the Sea seemed to spin its wheels and not get going, The Deep by Alma Katsu was very pretty but didn't pack much of a punch) but I loved ""The Writing Retreat"" by Julia Bartz (more thriller than straight horror), The Sanitarium.

1711661940.0,I never understood how “Head Full of Ghosts” could be interpreted as paranormal.,"The book seemed so deliberate in portraying everything in a way that could be reasonably explained, and yet I see reviews calling it occult or ghostly. If I recall correctly, Merry herself gives multiple methods in which the “hauntings” could have occurred; nor is her penchant for horror media an indicator that she seriously believes Marjorie was possessed. Even the more “out there” incidents have non-paranormal (if still bizarre) explanations.

To me, “Head Full of Ghosts” reads almost entirely as a book about child exploitation, and not at all one of true demonic possession: Marjorie was extremely mentally unwell (probably suffering from some form of psychosis), and was exploited by her church and corrupt reality TV. Even her parents used her for money— sure, they may have seen it to be in Marjorie and Merry’s benefit, but that’s still essentially what took place.

Either way, I really enjoyed this book, and I love hearing other’s thoughts on it. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

1711661270.0,Male horror authors and sexually assaulting female characters,"Recently I have reignited my passion for reading and found that horror literature, more specifically haunted house/ghost horror, is my favorite. I have been getting increasingly frustrated because many times when I find a book that seems to fit my ideal sub genre, I read the book to find that the biggest “spook” of the story revolves around a woman being penetrated in some perverted way. To name a few examples, a young woman masturbating, a woman penetrating herself with a cross or some other weird object, hyper sexualization, anal penetration, mutilation of breasts, and most recently a statue of Jesus Christ on the cross with a boner falling off the wall and penetrating a woman to death (I wish I was kidding, if you know you know). Seriously , what is wrong with these authors? Do I need to buy only women’s books to get non sexual horror? Jeez.

Saw someone around here talking about Trouble With Lichen about a month ago and decided to branch out and pick it up, and I genuinely couldn't put it down. Wyndham was such a GOAT in the dystopian genre and really should be better known than he is.

This is about a pair of researchers who both (separately) discover a medicine that prolongs human life about fivefold, so people can live 300+ years old. Problem is that it's derived from a super rare kind of lichen in China so supply is hard limited.

(Carrie retelling with bi-racial witch) That was the fastest book I've ever read. I wasn't expecting my first horror book read to go that well which makes it more Disappointing when I was reading Misery months later and was bored out of my mind and felt like I had to force myself to read (And I'm still only halfway though it, I'll have to force myself some more.), it was like really bad compared to Carrie in my opinion. I thought since it was the same author I would also like it.

I couldn't feel myself connecting to Paul like I did Carrie and was actively rooting for Annie to either torture him for the rest of his life or kill him. He was just so toxic and sexist. And there's nothing wrong with characters who are bad people (I actually prefer characters who are bad people), but he's not a bad person, he's just a dick without a decently sympathetic backstory to counteract him being boring and being a dickhead. Total opposite of my experience with Carrie.

Also the unnecessary info dumping, exposition and slow pace did not do Misery justice for that type of story. Enough with my little rant though.

Holy shit, this series of stories was amazing. I felt like the Hell that Ballingrud builds and the mythos (creatures/magic/satanism/carrion angels) that he writes is something that I want more of.

Many people had talked about The Visible Filth as a noteworthy story and while it was great, I felt like The Butcher’s Table was the fucking piece-de-resistance. It’s one of those final stories in a short story collection that brings in everything from previous stories but smartly and in layers. The characters are all introduced, they’re all terrible people with exception of the actual bloodythirsty pirates, but the writing presents them and builds the tension bringing in new elements and twists. You thought this weird satanic cult has power, well this other satanic cult looks down on them and laughs. Oh there’s a black market for items from hell, how does that affect the world or the people who deal in that? Wait there’s a Cannibal Priest with a femme fatale daughter? It just keeps building and building to a piano wire tension and it ends absolutely beautifully. I actually teared up listening to the narration of the final character because the prose presented still packs a bit of a punch. The Butcher’s Table is an A+ for me.

1711570525.0,Dead Eleven by Jimmy Juliano,"So last month I went to my local bookstore and found a display of Dead Eleven where the books were completely wrapped in black construction paper with very few details other than the title, author, trigger warnings (death of a child), and a brief blurb calling it the most original horror novel in years. I thought it was the most brilliant marketing technique for a horror novel and I immediately bought a copy and was given the dust jacket in a separate manila envelope instructed not to open it until after finishing the book. The bookstore was adamant that the book was to read going in completely blind and I was completely sold.

Well I just finished the book last night and going in blind did have an interesting effect. I was completely unaware what the book was about even as I was reading it. Is it a ghost story? A cult? A monster creature feature? The formatting of the book was also very interesting as it read almost like a found footage/analogue horror movie. Overall I enjoyed the book but I found it to be a little too slow paced and I thought the big reveal was underwhelming. I haven't opened the book jacket yet so I'm curious to finally see the cover. Given how the book was advertised I would have thought it would have a bigger following but I haven't seen anyone talking about it. Interestingly it's already being adapted into a movie which I think might be a better medium for this kind of story

Spoilers for those who read it: >!So turns out it ended up being a combination cult/ghost/monster book which was kind cool to see all three blended together. While I didn't really find any of the monster/ghost scenes to be that scary, the cult aspect really got under my skin especially towards the end when Kayla buys into the indoctrination. The one ghost scene that I found particularly creepy was when Lily has her first encounter with a Dead Thing at the abandoned school. Not so much because of the ghost's presence but more because of her finally realizing that there's actual truth to the legends and her trying to rebuild the walls of her skepticism. One thing about the reveal that kinda irks me is that the Demon is powerful enough to wipe out entire islands but is content to be trapped in the basement of the mansion. I at first suspected that it was a creature similar to IT where it went off a generational cycle reawakening every few couple of decades. And that the cult was pretending to be stuck in the 90's so that the demon would think that the century hasn't ended yet. I was mostly right but instead it was more about the island gaslighting the demon into thinking it just ate instead of it being 30 years since it's last meal. How this demon could simultaneously be strong enough to decimate entire populations yet so easily fooled by the islands plan just feels kinda silly!<",horrorlit

1711532366.0,True Crime taken to task in Pocket Hell - Penance by Eliza Clark,"The ethics of using real life violent crime as content canon fodder is one that I've always been of two minds about. On one hand, I've always been just as morbidly curious in the mechanics of which human beings find ways to hurt each other in the most extreme ways as anyone. I've read about my fair share of cases I've endlessly obsessed about, still find myself going down rabbit holes researching. I do see the merits in making dramas on subjects like real life serial killers like Netflix's infamous *Dahmer* series. There were details of the case I had personally never heard discussed before (which, to be fair I had to Google to verify were true, and not exactly all of them were, persay) about some of the orbiting figures in Dahmer's life. I never would have known to look up the very tragic real life story of Dahmer's own murderer and the injustice he suffered (though that wasn't covered much in the series itself.) With that said however, as someone who's had personal experiences that, though not nearly as extreme, give me some approximate understanding of what it must be like for the friends, families and survivors shoved into the public consciousness as sacrifices to the entertainment gods. Having what was likely one of the worst moment of their lives given a sometimes global audience, more often than not without their full consent, possibly without even their permission at all--- yeah, that does seem profoundly cruel. 

After spending my childhood and teenage years watching talk shows make dancing monkeys out of brutalized abuse victims, going down rabbit hole after rabbit hole of shock site content I was way too young to be looking at, spending some of my young adulthood listening to every white woman with a half decent camera casually describe some of the most horrific cases while she did her makeup, I found myself pretty well done with true crime personally. The lack of genuine thoughtful deconstruction of the reasons why people inflict this much pain on each other, how quickly it all devolved into exploitation and rubber-necking, I just tapped out. That's why, despite absolutely adoring Eliza Clark's first novel *Boy Parts*, when I read the blurb on what *Penance* was about when it was released, I sat on it for a good few months. I immediately recognized the real life crime the bones of the plot is based off of, and it put me off. Which I submit to you now as my final thesis on why book blurbs need to git gud, because I'm pretty sure Clark shares my frustrations on the subject matter. I've now completed a second read through a couple months after my first, and I feel this may be one of my favorite novels of all time. 

*Penance* is not only a masterfully written, absolutely haunting read, it functions as a exceedingly clever metafictial deconstruction of the true crime fad as a whole. It's not just loosely inspired by one, but a whole plethora of real life famous cases, some of which are even mention directly in the narrative. Clark manages to expertly weave together several true events into one cohesive story. The novel obscures each just enough to keep away from making any false equivalencies in analogy to any real cases, while maintaining a brutal feeling of realism. It plays with the audience's familiarity with one or more, if not most of the violent crimes it alludes to, creating this eerie sense of deja vu. Details of the narrative sound consistently farmiliar enough you'd swear you heard it before. On first read through the book even managed to trick me with one of it's minor plot points involving a fandom centered around a school shooting. I was sure I had heard of it before--- which the book lightly pokes fun at actually, there being so many school shooting in America now they're blurring together. The setting itself is also crafted expertly to create this sense of familiarity. You may have never been to or lived in a dying British beach town, but some element of it's characterization I'm sure will spark a connection in most people's brains of knowing a place like it. 

With this book along with her last I feel like Clark has truely solidified herself as something of a prominent voice of a generation--- namely, mine. Zillennials who were raised on unrestricted internet access between the dying breaths of the online wild west and the rise in social media. That most of the references and humor rely on the reader's familiarity with that general flavor of a chronically online lonely youth means some of it may not hit with all readers, but it had me pissing myself laughing at key moments. Furthermore, I feel it genuinely paint a raw, authentic experience of being a mentally unwell teenage girl left to rot quietly in a hostile community. Through the narrative's thorough exploration of the three primary culprits responsible for the horrific murder of a fellow classmate's metal states, you get three distinct ways the town itself and the small compounding failures of the adults around them fostered this series of events. It makes a compelling case it was almost inevitable. By crafting a story so reminiscent yet abstracted from real events, this novel feels a lot more like a meaningful examination of extreme violent crimes than most real coverage of it does. 

The biggest surprise for me however was the thorough dressing down the journalist acting as the reader's narrator gets in the text itself. The narrative sprinkles hints and details about his personal life that, though not in any way directly related to the plot, adds an intriguing secondary layer of examination that really makes this book something special. As a ride or die stan of the unreliable narrator, it's great to see one taken to task for being unreliable in the text--- I love it. He's the source of the book's biggest gut punch when it comes to satirizing the true crime genre. Though as a reader you can to some degree pick apart what elements of the novel were most impacted by his bias, as it roles to a close it leaves you with a lingering sense of unease. It denies you a sense of closure in the lack of confidence what truely took place. Clark, in a stroke of true evil genius, twists the knife with references to resources canonical in the novel with further (possibly more accurate) information is available that, of course, don't actually exist--- because this is fiction. This didn't really happen. You're left not really knowing. 

This book isn't one full of tense, brutal descriptions. It's frontloaded with one absolutely gruesome chapter that flavors the mounting dread as it recounts the events that led up to that horrific scene, for a more subtle, but palpable disturbing read. It's also somewhere between short and medium length, so you can get through it easily in one session if you're a fast reader. Even if true crime isn't your thing, I think it's worth a read. If it is, I doubt you'll walk away feeling judged or scolded for your taste in content--- just provided with some interesting perspective to chew on. I highly recommend checking this one out.

It really bothered me because it’s such a beautiful book, so I decided to try to write my own synopsis.

On December 12, 2019, nearly five years after the events of My Heart is a Chainsaw, 22 year old Jennifer “Jade” Daniels is released from prison and returns to her hometown of Proofrock, Idaho.  Jade was arrested because she was captured on video killing her father, however she could not be convicted of his murder because his body, which sunk to the bottom of the lake, was never found. 

A blizzard covers the Proofrock area, blocking cellular and internet service, and making travel difficult for the rest of the novel.

A Proofrock high school student, Toby Manx, is lured out of a motel where he was having a romantic tryst with his classmate Gwen Stapleton on the outskirts of town.  He believes another one of his female classmates wants to have sex with him but isn’t sure who it is. Once outside however, he is eviscerated and dies in the motel parking lot.

On the same day Jade returns and the blizzard begins, an Indigenous serial killer, Dark Mill South, is being transported through the area under armed guard in order to lead authorities to the bodies of some of his victims.  Dark Mill South seems to be a supernatural figure, he is unnaturally strong and resistant to injury, and doesn’t seem to feel pain.  A previous confrontation with one of his victims left him with a missing hand, which he has replaced with a hook.

Dark Mill South escapes custody near Proofrock.  Later, it is explained that the vibrations made by the large convoy caused an avalanche, killing everyone (including two Proofrock police officers), except for Dark Mill South and one snowplough driver.  South kills the driver and steals his snowplough, escaping to hide in the ruins of Terra Nova, the luxury home development across the lake from Proofrock that was abandoned after most of its residents were murdered in *Chainsaw.*

Jade first meets with former sheriff Amos Hardy outside of town.  He shows her a beautiful white elk he has observed, the elk is walking on the frozen lake and later walks around downtown Proofrock during the blizzard, seemingly lost.

Hardy and Jade are driven from the town’s dam control, where Hardy now works, to the town by junior deputy Banner Tompkins, Jade’s former high school classmate, now married to Letha Mondragon, who Jade believed in *Chainsaw* was the “final girl” who would save the town.

Jade and Letha have not spoken in several years, after Letha withdrew her support from Jade’s defence when Jade implicated Letha’s father Theo Mondragon in several of the killings in the previous novel.

Letha and Banner have a 2 year old daughter named Adrienne.  Letha, who was severely injured in Chainsaw when the ghost of Stacy Graves tried to rip off her jaw, has spent the intervening years becoming an expert in slasher movies like Jade, believing that she could have saved the massacre victims if she had been more aware of the supernatural threat. Letha has a replacement jaw, however she still has difficulty talking and eating, and needs to take antibiotics and pain killers multiple times a day.

Cinnamon Baker, a survivor of the previous massacre and now a high school senior, calls 911 and speaks with Banner and Jade.  She claims that Toby was killed after they had met for sex in a car, which the reader knows is incorrect based on the book’s opening scene.  Cinnamon also claims to have found the body of Toby’s first lover, Gwen, disemboweled and hanging from a tree.  She evades questions about inconsistencies in her story by sounding panicked and claims that she saw someone matching Dark Mill South’s description committing the murders.  Jade notes that the deaths sound similar to the opening scenes of the slasher movie *Scream*. Cinnamon is taken to the police station for her safety overnight but is not locked in a cell.

The next day, Jade is picked up by Letha and taken to the police station.  Banner has not heard from the other police officers, and no one in town is aware of the avalanche.  The three discover that Cinnamon has escaped.  Banner and Jade follow her footprints to a nearby retirement home.

Cinnamon’s twin sister Ginger is essentially imprisoned at the same retirement home, supposedly for her own safety.  During the massacre of the Terra Nova residents that took place during *Chainsaw* she had a panic attack and was left behind alone on the yacht while construction worker Grade Paulson (called “Shooting Glasses” by Jade) rescued Ginger and Galatea Pangborn. Ginger escaped the yacht and survived in the woods for several weeks, becoming violent and experiencing delusions.  Ginger and Cinnamon are identical twins, but Ginger’s head is kept shaved so she doesn’t try to pull out her hair. It is later revealed that Ginger is capable of escaping the retirement home and does so regularly.

Banner leaves Jade at the retirement home and returns to the station.  While waiting to hear about Cinnamon’s recovery, Jade sneaks into Ginger’s room speak with her, and later stumbles onto the bodies of two high school-aged retirement home employees, who have been stabbed to death after sneaking off to an empty room to have sex.  Jade notices that these murders are similar to the deaths of two characters in another slasher film, *Friday the 13th* (the boy was pierced through the throat with an arrow and the girl was killed by a fire axe to the face). Deciding she needs to return to the police station to warn Banner about the killings, she discovers the body of another teen employee, who was suffocated when a garment bag was placed over his head.  Jade notes this death is similar to a death in the movie *Black Christmas*. She uses the teen’s snowmobile to return to the police station.

Concurrently, three students (Abby, Wynona and Jensen) sneak into the high school to play a game of strip basketball. Wynona is attacked and killed with a heavy trophy, and Abby is attacked with the lid of a toilet tank, which destroys one side of her face. Jensen is stabbed in the head from behind and then runs into the antlers of a mounted elk head while trying to escape (Similar to a death in *Silent Night, Deadly Night*).  The scene is shown from Jensen’s perspective, he never sees his attacker(s).

Abby, badly injured but alive is able to call the police station.  Banner and Jade are eventually able to bring the town doctor to the school to help Abby, although she is said to have later died of her injuries.

Jade calls Cinnamon from Abby’s cell phone.  Cinnamon claims to still be at the retirement home.  Jade asks Cinnamon to confirm a story that Ginger had told her earlier, about the two girls finding a blob of organic tissue under a pier in 2015 that got bigger when they fed it meat, and that Cinnamon (after Ginger was locked up at the retirement home) saw grow into a human girl who later disappeared.  Cinnamon confirms seeing the blob, but believed it was gore left from the massacre, and denies feeding it.  Jade is unsure if she should believe Cinnamon.

Meanwhile, Letha, alone with her daughter at the station, sees a figure outside and shoots him, believing it to be Dark Mill South. She actually shoots Rexall, the school janitor, who is out because he believes he saw Tab Daniels, his best friend and Jennifer’s father, through the cameras he has hidden around town.  Dark Mill South was previously said to resemble Tab. 

Rexall, in pain but not severely hurt, lashes out at Banner and Lonnie (the town mechanic and another friend of Tab and Rexall) when they try to help him. Banner shoots the weapon Lonnie was going to attack Rexall with out of Lonnie’s hand, and then places Rexall in a holding cell since he doesn’t have anywhere else to put him.

Banner and Rexall later hear something heavy slamming into the side of the police station, and Rexall, terrified, shouts that “she” is trying to get him. The attacker is later implied to be the white elk.
 
Jade believes that the blob the twins found under the pier may have been a reanimated Stacy Graves, so Letha and Jade take a snowmobile across the frozen lake to investigate Terra Nova.  While there, Jade and Letha bond over their situation and their shared love of slasher movies. Jade also points out to Letha that many of the deaths resemble deaths from slasher movies.

Jade and Letha accidentally stumble across Dark Mill South, who has been hiding in one of the abandoned homes.  South’s internal monologue reveals that he has been hiding at Terra Nova the entire time since his escape, and therefore he could not have been involved in the recent murders.

Letha slightly injures South by throwing knives at him, however he quickly recovers, and throws one of the knives back at her, injuring her shoulder.  Forcing Jade to hide under a sink, Letha leads South away by running to another house.  Jade follows attacks South from behind with a hammer, causing him to fall through rotting floorboards of the house to the basement. This slows South down slightly, but injures Letha further when the house collapses.

The two women lose the snowmobile key in the struggle, and are forced to walk back across the lake.  On the way they meet Claude Armitage, the high school history teacher.

Armitage has been using cross country skis to ski across the frozen lake to Camp Blood, as he is obsessed with slasher films as well as the Proofrock massacre.

Armitage’s internal monologue reveals that he has or had an illicit sexual relationship with Cinnamon Baker.  He is also implied to be grooming Galatea, who is only 14.  

Upon returning to the shore of the town, Armitage, Jade and Letha discover the mutilated body of Lonnie. Armitage believes Lonnie’s murder resembles the opening scene from *It Follows.*

They also find the snowmobile, meaning Dark Mill South found the key and is already in Proofrock.

The trio return to the police station, Letha passes out from her injuries and is not involved in the rest of the plot.

Hardy and Cinnamon also arrive separately at the police station.

Prior to arriving at the police station, Cinnamon has, at Banner’s request, driven to Main Street using Banner’s truck to warn eight of her high school classmates to lock themselves in the video store they run for a class project, for their own safety.  The students were previously unaware of the murders and were out shovelling Main street to keep it clean for local businesses.

At the station, Cinnamon explains that she lied to Ginger about feeding the blob so her twin would continue talking to her.  Ginger wanted the blob to kill Proofrock residents and for the murders to be blamed on Jade, in revenge for the twins parents and the other Terra Nova residents being murdered and Jade not being able to stop the massacre.

After this however, “Cinnamon’s” wig falls off, and she is revealed to be a disguised Ginger. Ginger then runs away.

Jade and Armitage leave the station.  Jade plans to get the doctor from the high school to help Letha, and Armitage goes to the retirement home to see if the real Cinnamon is still there.

Jade passes through Main Street and sees Banner’s truck, left unlocked and running.

She finds one of the twins murdered beside the truck.  Jade believes the dead twin is Cinnamon and that she has been killed by Ginger.

The truck is next to the video store. Jade sees a body in the video store window and goes inside. Most of the teens are dead.  They were given poisoned cupcakes by Ginger or Cinnamon, a reference to the film *Happy Death Day.*

After they died, Dark Mill South entered the store and began mutilating their bodies.  Jade believes it was South who killed the twin Jade found outside, and since she has not seen *Happy Death Day*, which came out when she was in jail, she believes South killed all the teens.

Jade and the still-living teens try to fight Dark Mill South. Jade escapes onto the street.  South follows, and the other twin (who Jade believes is Cinnamon) arrives and confronts South, claiming that he killed her sister.

South is slowed by Cinnamon, but when he turns to attack Jade, Kimmy, Jade’s absentee mother who was working at the dollar store nearby, attacks South with her purse.  

Suddenly, Kimmy is killed by the white elk, which is still wandering Main Street.

The white elk, which is also implied to be the blob Ginger and Cinnamon found under the pier, is a manifestation of the vengeful spirit of Melanie Hardy, sheriff Hardy’s daughter who drowned near the dam at age 12 while swimming with her friends.  The elk only attacks the people who were with Melanie when she died. It was therefore the elk that killed Lonnie and attacked Rexall when he was in the jail cell.

The elk leaves after killing Kimmy.

Cinnamon tries to attack South again, but he is too strong and he throws her into the truck’s bumper. Cinnamon is badly injured but lives.

Near the end of the novel it is revealed that both twins had shaved their heads and were wearing wigs. It is implied that Cinnamon may have been the one committing the murders, in retaliation for her classmates spreading rumours about her relationship with Armitage.

Jade also comes to believe, near the end of the novel, that Cinnamon killed her classmates, and also killed her sister, although she doesn’t fully understand Cinnamon’s motivations.  Jade reasons that Cinnamon planned the murders to resemble murders from slasher movies in order to frame Jade, but later decided Dark Mill South was a more believable scapegoat.

Armitage returns and attacks South with a machete, but South shoots him. Armitage is badly injured but lives.

Before South can recover and attack Jade again, Banner, who has found the snowplough South stole to escape, hits South with the plough and drives it into the lake, hoping to drown South.

Hardy comes to Main Street after hearing the commotion, and Jade, Banner and Hardy are shocked to find South still alive and walking across the ice to attack again.

Hardy tells Jade and Banner to escape, but they know his gun is only filled with birdshot that will not kill South.

Jade runs through the snow to find a weapon.  She finds her trash grabbing stick, which she hidden behind some bushes in the previous novel.  She rushes Dark Mill South and stabs him in the heart, finally killing him.

After South’s death, Jade and Hardy sit outside and Rexall is sent to bring them in. The white elk arrives tries to gore Rexall but can’t, and Rexall shoots the elk.  The dead elk seems to dissolve, and inside it is a version of Melanie Hardy, who is also dissolving.  Jade and Hardy walk across the lake in order to return her spirit to the lake.  It is implied that Hardy decides to drown with his daughter so their spirits could reunite.

When the authorities arrive, Jade takes responsibility for driving the snowplow into the lake so Banner doesn’t loose his job, both out of friendship and because she believes Banner can better protect the town from future threats than new officers.

Jade is arrested, since destroying public property violates her parole.

Before being taken away by police helicopter, Jade holds Dark Mill South’s hook hand up in triumph.

1711499203.0,"Lingering confusion after reading ""The Ring"" by Suzuki","I finished all 5 ring novels and I honestly just felt more confused afterwards. There were a few gaps here and there that just didn’t make sense. For example, Ryuji/Kaoru dies at the end of Birthday from rapid aging but is apparently still alive in S, even though he is then executed and becomes a fucking digital ghost? Or like what Akane did during those 6 unaccounted minutes where the story said she turned her phone off or what she did to Niimura during that, or why Niimura killed all the remaining 12y/o Sadako and was after Akane next. It wasn’t really explained what the significance of the letter “S” is and it was only mentioned 3 times (not including the title): when prisoner Seiji (actual identity Ryuji/Kaoru) is given capital punishment for the false indictment of 4 kidnappings writes the letter S in a book, when a kid in a hospital waiting room writes an S in the form of a snake, and when Akane hears 2 girls that talk about a creepy video when you lookup “S” online at her wedding (she couldn’t locate them).  
It kinda made sense that the 1st edition Ring novels carried a virus and that later editions also carried the inoculation, but maybe Niimura was infected by this book and was guided to do what he did by Sadako. But why? Sadako died at the end of Birthday and wasn’t in S, except for the fact that she had little clones running around and that Akane was her child / look-a-like.  
And then there’s the whole outer simulation conspiracy that someone from outside the sim is interfering and pulling strings, which is the most likely explanation in the entire series. I mean it doesn’t really make sense why Sadako has psychic powers or why beams of light (tell tale sign of someone outside sim looking in) appear: when Mai Takano died trapped on a rooftop, when Ryuji was saying hi to his girlfriend, when Niimura was guided to walk in front of the train (who was he controlled by, “God” or Akane, because Sadako is known to possess the power to control people, like in  Birthday), when Sadako’s lover was dying in her hands at the end of Birthday, etc. Still a lot unanswered, like also why Sadako’s theater friends all died like 30 years later or why she left her lover to be last. I mean it was implied that her psychic virus got carried in the sex tape that was broadcast over the casting speakers and the people that heard it were infected. I’m not even sure WTF the little altar with the placenta was about. Something about pregnancy, even though Sadako wasn’t pregnant or going to be pregnant at the time.  
I also have no idea why outside the simulation, Suiki’s child knew she was doing the sex with Kaoru, and then FUCKING KILLED HIMSELF after he found out. I mean he had stage 4000 cancer but the fuck, jealous?  
And then there’s the psychopathy of Dr Eliot introducing the Ring virus into the host universe so he could invent a cure and then get more money for his stupid simulation  
Also I was so confused by the mention of “citrus” and “sour” when describing Sadako’s powers. Why citrus? Why did Asakawa experience that when he felt his premonition about Ryuji? There were also other times when simulated characters had that, like the Theatre Boyfriend (I think?). Mentions:  
• Shizuku receiving visions after rescuing the statue from the water, “citrus fragance”  
• Asakawa watching Ryuji walk up stairs, “scent of citrus…”  
• Not exactly, but when the niece in Book 1 is being stalked, she describes her stalker as giving off a “sour stench”  
• When Ryuji talked about raping that girl in college, “I can smell it- the impulse I felt then” which is extremely similar to what the Dr felt when he described his impulse for raping Sadako.  
• When Asakawa and Ryuji breach the well, “a putrid smell arose on the cold air”  
Something else that is unresolved is why Ryuji was compelled to lie about raping the girl to appear cool, but if it really did happen, why was he either compelled by Sadako or “God” to do so?  
Also, just a footnote, but this author does not know how to write women. I almost puked when he started describing teenage puss and how spherical Akane’s boobs were.",horrorlit

1711496037.0,Specific book rec request,"This is going to be tedious, because my wife can be very picky, but I'm trying to find a good book recommendation that fits her admittedly very specific niche. I'm just curious if anyone here has recs. Her favorite type of book is at the crossroads between ghostly paranormal, horror, mystery fiction, and romance. 

Her favorite books would be these slightly older Simone St. James books, as opposed to her newer work, which becomes more thriller than ghostly mystery:
-The Haunting of Maddy Clare 
-An Inquiry Into Love and Death
-The Other Side of Midnight 
-Silence for the Dead 
-Lost Among the Living 

She likes books by Wendy Webb, Karen White, Colleen Gleason, Jennifer McMahon, and also Kerri Maniscalco. She also liked The Last Days of Jack Sparks by Jason Arnopp.

She couldn't really get into Susanna Kearsley or Darcy Coates.

Specifically: 1. Books that focus on a mystery, 2. Have ghosts in them (but aren't directly a medium just openly chatting away with them), 3. Aren't overly depressive (couple who are grieving the loss of their child, etc.), and 4. If it has any romance in it, that's an added bonus that she really doesn't mind.

1711457435.0,Help me! I'm looking for short stories where someone murders a family member or loved one.,"I have a fairly specific request. 

I'm looking for **short stories** where:

* An ordinary person is driven by unusual circumstances to murder a family member or a loved one. Typically because it's slowly revealed over the course of the story that the victim was actually a giant asshole.
* The character who commits murder is NOT clearly evil to the reader from page 1, not clearly mentally unhinged from page 1, or secretly a serial killer, abusive, etc. They actually seem like a normal, everyday person who wouldn't do that type of thing.
* The murderer is the protagonist, probably the main character, and you follow their emotional journey from ordinary person to murderer.
* The murderous character is actually somewhat sympathetic, and the horror of the story is that you can see the twisted logic and emotional drive and relate to why they end up doing something so horrible. *Oh no, I'm relating to a murderer!*

Some examples of the vibe I'm looking for:

""Children of the Fang"" by John Langan: >!The main character finds out what an evil, manipulative dick her grandpa is, and that he was probably behind the mysterious disappearance of her uncle (IIRC). While kind of possessed by that reptile/dinosaur that imbues her with a murderous rage, she kills him. What an awful thing to do, but as a reader you can't help but understand where she's coming from to a degree.!< 

*Midsommar:* >!Of course a movie not a short story, but it's a great example. Dani is grieving after a double-murder suicide of her family that is truly one of the most nightmarish things you can imagine happening to you. And yet through the whole movie, her boyfriend is ridiculously selfish, unsupportive and insensitive to her emotional needs.!< 

>!So when the cult are the only people around showing her any support or compassion, you can't help but feel an awful sense of sympathy for her as she decides to join the cult and choose her boyfriend as the guy that is immolated alive.!<

I thought about *The Shining,* but it doesn't really fit because Jack isn't a very sympathetic character IMHO, he's not the protagonist, and he doesn't ""succeed."" Sure, you sympathize with him more in the book than the movie because you see his POV as a guy struggling with alcoholism and possession, but he's still the antagonist and unquestionably the villain. 

I'm open to suggestions for movies too, even novels if that's what jumps to mind, but I am MOST interested in short stories recs.",horrorlit
1711453656.0,“I’m thinking of ending things”,"How did Kaufman butcher this book so badly? Especially with the cast he had. I think the actors absolutely nailed their characters but the book is SO much better than the movie. 

I know some people have issues with some things not being tied up (the caller, the man at the window) but I think the book is amazing. I wish the movie would have stayed true to the ending. It could have been Lucy stabbing Jake with the coat hanger and then the camera pans out and it’s actually Jake stabbing himself (getting flashbacks to Toni Collette decapitating herself in hereditary).

Reid does a great job at painting the creepy rural atmosphere. As someone who moved from the suburbs to a rural area, it’s on the fucking nose. Especially the ending part about his parents staying together just for convenience. In these desolate areas, many people feel like they don’t have the option to leave, or to change. The ice cream scene is my favorite. Full body chills. “You don’t have to go.” So powerful.

I think the loose ends add to the emotions one would experience while being that close to suicide. All the what’s ifs and blurry memories one would have.

So yeah, I'm a college student in my final year and I'm writing my final paper on societal anxieties in the second half of the twentieth century, focusing on fears directed at queer people, emancipation of women and class struggles, following them in Rosemary's Baby, Child of God and Fight Club, using mostly queer&feminist studies and marxist class analysis

1711427272.0,Finding a Horror Book,"Hello!  
This is my first time making a post on Reddit, but I've been looking for a book I read a long time ago, so I thought I'd check here to see if anyone can help me.  
I don't remember the name or author of the book, but here's the plot:  
A group of horror authors are brought together to a haunted house to write a book together. During their stay in this house, they are also being filmed by a television company (I think I remember something about the company being a little suspicious, but they were trying to make money, they weren't doing anything with the haunting). Weird things kept happening (as they do in horror books) and one of the characters is pushed into a hole by a tree (I think). Also, the top floor of the house is boarded off and somehow one of the characters gets stuck there. The boarded up part played a really big role in the book, because one of the spirits that haunted the house was boarded up there by someone else. (SPOILER ALERT) at the end of the book, it's revealed within the last two pages that one of the authors (the only woman) turned out to be a fake version of herself with silver eyes (or with one silver eye or something about her eye was different).  
I know that the author was male (you can tell by how the female character was written) and I do have an excerpt of the book which I'll put down below:  
""...the two couldn't have looked more different: a bulky, wool coat draped over Sebastien's tall, frail body; tight black jeans and an even tighter long-sleeve tee with a lace-up front clung to Moore, barely containing.... Together they were the reluctant intersection of Elegance and Rebellion.""  
That's how I know the author was male. Also, two of the characters are named Sebastien and Moore. I would really appreciate if someone could help me find this book. Thank you!",horrorlit
1711427246.0,Stephen King’s Revival,"Finished the book last night. Feeling pretty underwhelmed with the conclusion. I like King a lot, The Stand and Pet Semetary have been favorites for a long time - thought I’d give Revival a chance because consistently I see pretty glowing reviews for it in this sub… But I guess I just expected more?

I enjoyed some pieces of the story - he is a master of slow burn characterization, was compelled by Jamie’s story. The Frankenstein parallels were cool and I thought they worked better than the faux-Lovecraft bits. But for whatever reason the cosmic horror of this story just fell flat to me, and the “dark” ending felt more like a cheap turn of the knife than anything else. Like the end of a subpar Black Mirror episode - bleakness for the sake of bleakness, the emotional punch wasn’t there.

1711403621.0,I read Gone to the River Man! ,"I saw this book recommended in a couple of different threads and I decided to give it a go. Namely there was one about the most disturbing horror books and this came up a few times. I thought I’d give it a go since I feel like I haven’t read a book which really disturbed me in a while. 

I have mixed feelings. I did enjoy the writing style (I often find that ‘splatter punk’ horror suffers from poor writing despite interesting plots) but it was just kind of…. Lacking something? Or maybe it had too much of the wrong stuff for me.  It wasn’t a bad book by any means and some of it did make my skin crawl. But it’s left me questioning what I want/love in horror novels. 

I’m starting to worry my days of really getting into horror stories is over. I think I really like understated slow burns, and recently I’ve been on a track with reading technically good and well written stories but they’re just too much. Like there is no room for imagination.

1711396131.0,I finally started my 17-book adventure to The Dark Tower with The Stand and it's a horror masterpiece,"“The Stand” by Stephen King is a novel I regret not reading sooner. I knew going into this that greatness was awaiting since many readers consider this one of King’s best books ever written and let me tell you, it delivered and then some. In case you didn’t know, I have officially decided to start my journey to The Dark Tower and wanted to do a ton of pre-reading to ensure I get the complete experience the best I can.

I am conquering The Dark Tower by reading all these books leading up to it. In case you want to know what I think the best reading route to go is, here’s how I’m reading everything after weeks of research and asking several Constant Readers for their feedback...

The Stand  
The Eyes of the Dragon  
Insomnia  
Hearts in Atlantis  
‘Salem’s Lot  
The Talisman  
Black House  
Everything's Eventual (The Little Sisters of Eluria)  
The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger  
The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three  
The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands  
Charlie the Choo-Choo  
The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass  
The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole  
The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla  
The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah  
The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower

I know, I know. 17 books. I have thousands of hours of reading ahead of me but if “The Stand” is any indication, this will easily be one of the best reading experiences of my life. I’m super excited to finally read all these books (some I have already read) and my goal is to be finished before King’s next new anthology “You Like It Darker” comes out on May 21, 2024.

Before I jump into my review, I found a ton of trigger warnings while reading as many of these are very graphic. They were…

\- Cancer  
\- Suicide  
\- Abortion  
\- Domestic abuse (physical)  
\- Racism  
\- Pandemic  
\- Quarantine  
\- Dead animals (cars, dogs, kittens, rabbits, and rats)  
\- Drugs  
\- Drinking and driving  
\- Parental abuse (mental and physical)  
\- Vaccination  
\- Rape  
\- Bullying  
\- Dead children  
\- Burning churches  
\- Homophobia  
\- Death of a child  
\- Self-harm  
\- Cannibalism  
\- Violence against women  
\- Religion  
\- Politics  
\- Violence against animals (hens and chickens)

If any of these triggers you, please do not read this novel. “The Stand” is hands down a horror masterpiece and at this point in my life, the longest book I have ever read. This tome is 1,348 pages deep and I know is an intimidating number to many but it’s worth it.

There are two versions of “The Stand” which is the original one that was released and truncated in 1975 due to how much of a behemoth this novel was at the time and a newly re-released “complete and uncut” one in 1990. I went with the latter since King re-added over 400 pages of text that were removed and revised everything to unleash the true vision of this novel he wanted. I love how King wrote about that to start this novel off to keep it real with his Constant Readers. It is officially King’s longest stand-alone novel in his catalog and will go down in history as one of the greatest horror novels ever written.

King held nothing back in “The Stand” as the intense opening set the groundwork for one hell of a ride. I loved the tension and suspense right off the bat and instantly loved all the unique characters I met along the way.

Speaking of which, there are a ton of characters in this novel to the point where I had to take quick notes on who is who due to a lengthy list of people. I didn’t want to get confused but thanks to my notes, it was pretty easy to remember everyone and enjoy everything in stride. I also loved all the references King had in here from my hometown of Queens here in New York, Freddy Krueger, The Lord of the Rings, Shirley Jackson, Norman Bates, and many more.

This novel was divided into three books all of which contained a bunch of mini-stories in addition to the main story. It was just a brilliant way of formatting everything so you are still kept in the loop of what was going on with the main characters and also all these side characters. I loved how you never knew who could end up being one to keep an eye on as their story progressed.

There weren’t any boring parts as all the dialogue, situations, and horror were top-notch. King is the master of subtle horror that hits you and continues bringing that terrifying dread of what was ultimately going on. Needless to say, this novel hit home with me and probably many other readers since it’s eerily similar to the whole COVID-19 pandemic we dealt with a few years ago. Imagine that but taken to extreme new heights in a way only King can deliver.

All the descriptions, stories, atmosphere, and overall horror are perfection. I couldn’t put this novel down as it took me over two weeks to read and I even dedicated my days off from work to get through it because it’s such a massive and addictive novel. It’s great and I assure you if you’re one of those readers that think this book is too big or would take forever to read, it’s worth it if you chip away each day and don’t rush anything. Take your time reading this as it’s a novel you will never forget for the rest of your life.

Another nice touch was how King added graphic illustrations to this novel as you read to capture some pivotal (and creepy) moments to add to this epic reading experience. I love when authors do this since it brings me back to my teenage days of reading horror paperback books where every chapter had a graphic illustration or they were sprinkled in between chapters.

King did not hold back when it came to all the horror, gore, and creepiness. Some of which I couldn’t believe and made many weird faces while reading as I started to put the pieces together to the mystery of this disease. Once that was revealed, a whole new part of this novel opened up to situations I never read before in a horror novel.

Once all the characters were finally connected and the race to the end was on, this is where “The Stand” truly delivered. There’s even more horror including a bloodbath of an action scene that was unexpected and pretty intense with some of the main characters. Out of this impressive roster of characters, while hard to choose, I loved Frannie, Stu, Nick, and of course, Kojak the dog. I can’t also leave out the main antagonist who had some scenes that sent chills down my spine… the infamous “Man in Black” Randall Flagg.

This was the first time I’ve ever read a novel involving Flagg and wow, I can see why he is despised by so many. Some of the situations involving Flagg were insane and now that I got my introduction to him, I’m excited to see what happens in the future with such an iconic villain in King’s Dark Tower universe.

The climactic race to the end was monumental as King takes the famous “good vs. bad” angle to new horrific heights. Don’t worry, I won’t spoil anything for you but all the plot twists and turns led to an awesome drop-the-mic ending. It was so good that I went back to re-read the last few chapters again because they were outstanding. I never saw that coming and am beyond satisfied with how it ended. The range of emotions from sadness, laughter, rage, disbelief, hope, and heartwarming moments were just some of what I experienced while reading this novel. All of which will last a lifetime with me as it was such a powerhouse of a novel.

I give “The Stand” by Stephen King a 5/5 and would give it a 10/5 if I could because this was by far one of the best novels I’ve ever read by King and in my entire life. The incredible story, memorable characters, a villain for the ages, brutal horror that only King can deliver, and the power of hope led to such a powerful read. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to prepare for the next step in my journey to The Dark Tower as I plan to start “The Eyes of the Dragon” next.

1711381633.0,Looking for something other than King.,"Edit: I've gotten so many recommendations! Thank you everyone, I'm going to make a list and get working on it!

I love reading horror and thrillers, and I have tried a couple different authors, but am having trouble finding something that I fully enjoy.

I've read;

Baby Teeth by Zoje Stage - hated it, very predictable and all around unenjoyable to read. Though, very easy and finished in one sitting.

My Best Friend's Exorcism by Grady Hendrix - not my cup of tea at all, read it to try the author, I'm okay not reading more. Also completed in one sitting.

The Only Good Indian by Stephen Graham Jones - I haven't finished it yet, but I really enjoy it!

The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson - I loved it, it gave me that, ""huh, wtf is going on,"" that I'm looking for.

Baby Teeth taught me that I don't want to read about rich people with no real problems. My Best Friend's Exorcism taught me that I don't want to read horror/comedy.

The Only Good Indian and Haunting of Hill House taught me that I enjoy reading about characters who lose their grip on reality and are haunted in one way or another.

My top five Kings (from what I've read);

1. Desperation
2. Rage
3. Sometimes They Come Back (short story)
4. I Am the Doorway (short story)
5. Salem's Lot

I like Desperation because of the ""ancient evil unearthed"" aspect of the book. I like casts of characters that are flawed and have to get over themselves to survive. I like reading about people working together.

I like Rage because it made me think. I Am the Doorway genuinely creeped me out (cosmophobia). Sometimes They Come Back is a huge inspiration for my own writing.

Salem's Lot is Salem's Lot.

1711380862.0,The Winnowing Draw by Michael Tichy (Weird Western),"A raw, weird, wild, and extremely violent examination of colonialism and American frontier expansion through the lens of a bloodthirsty army unit literally blazing a trail west and a cat and mouse game between a runaway boy and psychopathic bounty hunter. Supernatural creatures dot the landscape, posed as victims and resistance to those that would tame the wilds. Those that venture west will be stripped raw of who they think they are, their true selves revealed and the remaining visage is rarely kind to its owner.

The Winnowing Draw is more akin to Walk the Darkness Down by John Boden than S. Craig Zahler, the later of which gets mentioned here a lot, but fans of both will probably like this as well. It's a book rooted in exciting genre flair, but with bigger philosophical aspirations that work more often than they don't.

Last horror book I read and loved was Tear (2022) by Erica McKeen - chance this is more of a recent Canadian hit and not read much outside of Canada but curious if anyone else has read / liked it? Or even if you didn't love it would love to hear your thoughts.

March 2024

3/5 Teatro Grottesco, Thomas Ligotti. Fabulous writing, like Eraserhead by way of Lovecraft, not something you can plough through in one sitting. Grim.

5/5 A Head full of ghosts, Paul Tremblay. Terrific post modern possession tale, tragic story, the meta elements worked for once.

4/5 Song of Kali, Dan Simmons. Good mystery, thriller, fantasy, horror, tragedy story, fabulous descriptive writing.

3/5 Gone to see the river man, Kristopher Triana, great pulpy southern gothic atmosphere with another complex protagonist.

2/5 Blood meridian, Cormac Macarthy, repetitive, somehow long indulgent descriptions that somehow alienate rather than engage.

1711349155.0,Looking for more fun horror! ,"I had an amazing March of horror reads, and I’m hoping to find more along those lines. I haven’t had this much fun reading in a *long* time, and I’d like to keep the momentum going! 

This Delicious Death by Kayla Cottingham, A Touch of Jen by Beth Morgan, The Honeys by Ryan La Sala, and Into the Drowning Deep by Mira Grant were all fantastic and while not perfect, they were such a blast to read I didn’t even mind the flaws. 

Things I enjoyed about these various storylines: 

- Queer characters & romance! The build seemed so realistic against these gruisome backdrops. I usually don’t enjoy romance in horror, but it worked for me in some of these. 

- The humor to balance the scares

- As a marine scientist myself, I appreciated Mira Grant’s attention to ocean detail (even if a lot of it was nonsense, you can tell she cared!)

- Subverting of tropes like the zombies in This Delicious Death being people just trying to live peacefully alongside humans 

- Disability representation (why is a mermaid creature feature from 2017 the best depiction of autism & dead characters I’ve read?) 

If any of this sounds familiar to other books you enjoy, or even if you just got similar vibes, please let me know! Thanks a lot in advance for your time. 

Notes: I would love if the recs were written by femmes

1711322282.0,"Hell In A Cell: two books enter, one book leaves. John Langan’s The Fisherman vs. Stephen Graham Jones’ The Only Good Indians. Who takes it?","John Langan’s *The Fisherman* is one of the most recommended and read books here, judging by the time I spend here. One third meditation on grief, one third dark fantasy adventure (easily my favorite portion of the book), and one third cosmic horror. 

Stephen Graham Jones’ *The Only Good Indians* is less golden calf and more polarizing. It’s a meditation on family legacies and trauma filtered through supernatural vengeance. People say there is too much basketball. A local (to me) cosmic horror bookstore owner described this as one of SGJ’s two classics (the other being *My Heart Is A Chainsaw*.)

Of these two books, my favorite moment came from TOGI in the deaths of Lewis, Peta, and Shaney. It surprised the shit out of me and was really well written. I’d say I also slightly enjoyed reading TOGI more, but it’s close.

1711297400.0,Wounds and North American Lake Monsters,"I read Wounds, the short story collection by Nathan Ballingrud. I thought it was really incredible. Each story was really unique and fascinating but also helped to build on the world. The Butchers Table was my favorite just because the extra length allowed for so much more development of the concepts and fascinating hell related worldbuilding. The Visible Filth is the one the collection is known for and it was really good too. The one that’s really stuck with me is The Maw, because of the bizarre connection between love and hell (which is also a theme throughout the book). The only one I didn’t really like was The Diabolist- had some cool concepts but didn’t tie them together very well. 

I just finished reading North American Lake Monsters, which is a collection by the same author. My favorite stories in this were The Good Husband, You Go Where It Takes You and The Way Station. The others were mostly really good too, except the issue was that I realized they were all kind of about the same character: depressed blue collar man with pent up violence and toxic masculinity, who usually thinks his wife is cheating on him. Anyways, I think any of them would have been really good on their own but it got really tiring feeling like I was reading the same story repeatedly. The Way Station was the story that stuck with me from this collection. The idea of a man being haunted by a city is so eerie and beautiful.

Nathan Ballingrud is an excellent writer who’s great at using supernatural elements to express emotional conflicts and societal issues. I just think he needs to find out about more emotional conflicts and societal issues. Anyways, it seems like NALM is the collection that’s gotten more recognition and fame but personally I’d recommend Wounds more.

1711293470.0,***Spoilers*** Silver Nitrate - revealing typo?,"This post will discuss a twist that occurs partway through Silver Nitrate by Silvia Moreno-Garcia so please be warned!!

I just finished this book, which I enjoyed more than expected (I liked it better than Mexican Gothic). I noticed something on page 180 that I suspect is a typo but if so, an unfortunate one! 

At that point in the book, the main characters have just met with Marisa Montero, supposedly the niece of Alma Montero. There are hints that Marisa is not what she seems, and it is later revealed >!that she is actually Alma, who has been using magic to keep herself from aging.!< This was not a particularly shocking twist, given the hints, but the biggest clue is that on page 180, there is a line thought by Montserrat that says: ""Her meeting with Alma had, despite her indifferent façade in front of Tristán, jolted her a little."" This refers to the meeting with Marisa and seems like a slip! Hard to imagine that this was missed in editing - but also not sure that the author would throw it in on purpose?

1711245891.0,Horror based on Shakespeare ,"I have just finished Macbeth: A Tale Of Horror by Stefano Ascari, a fantastic graphic novel based on Shakespeare’s Macbeth (as if that weren’t obvious). I loved how the Weird Sisters had a much bigger role than they do in the play and the artwork is wonderful. 

I was wondering if anyone knew of any other horror works based on Shakespeare’ writing. I know there’s a lot of romance stuff but so much of his work opens itself up to the darker side; Titus Andronicus is a horror story in and of itself. Even A Midsummer Night’s Dream could be considered rather sinister if you take into account that the apparently happy ending has Demetrius still under the influence of a drug that forces him to love a woman that he actually despises. If anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them. Doesn’t have to be graphic novels, I’m open to anything. Thanks.

1711242129.0,Blackwater (Michael McDowell) explanation ideas?,"Hello everyone, yesterday I finished reading the Blackwater saga. I really enjoyed the books. I was expecting something different having only read the synopsis of the first book before starting the entire saga; but I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the story was much more focused on the various family stories and relationships with horror elements dosed in small quantities but at the right moments.  
However, I wanted to ask if anyone had any ideas about possible explanations for the supernatural events. I'm not talking about the dual entity of Elinor, Frances, and Nerita since I think these are simply half-human, half-sea creatures without needing much explanation. Instead, I'm referring to the room at the front of Elinor's house (where Genevieve's jewels appeared), the tangible appearances of John Robert DeBordenave and Mary-Love (and how they disappeared after Elinor's death), the events that led to Queenie's death, etc.  
I can't explain how completely supernatural events (objects appearing out of nowhere and tangible returns of the dead) can be associated with ""simple"" half-human, half-sea creatures. Perhaps the unsaid was intended to increase the mystery surrounding these beings, but if anyone has any ideas or explanations, I would love to hear them.

1711212773.0,Can (supernatural) horror be considered low fantasy? ,"Fantasy is one of my favorite book genres (along with horror) but I’m not a fan of having tons of fantasy elements in my fantasy. My introduction was ASOIAF/Game of Thrones, which aside from secondary-world stuff, is relatively light on fantasy/magic stuff.

I’m not a fan of most urban/modern-day fantasy because it’s like if there’s *any* fantasy then there needs to be minimum 10+ fantasy-checklist things on it. There’s no shortage of vampires in horror, but if it’s a fantasy book with vampires, then there needs to be werewolves and a couple other supernatural species, vampire hunters, a secret supernatural creature society, magical artifacts, etc. In *Let the Right One In*…it’s just a vampire. In Stranger Things, it’s basically just Eleven with powers and some demonic creatures. Not her going to a school with other kids with supernatural powers learning to use them against supernatural entities and finding supernatural items.

I do like modern-day (especially secondary-world) fantasy that’s super minimal on the fantasy, but they’re few and far between. It’s like either the fantasy is 1-2 or 7-10. Horror seems to have the low amount of fantasy/supernatural elements I enjoy despite typically being considered a separate genre. Stephen King books like Carrie, The Shining, and IT are good examples.

1711159586.0,Short stories/novellas for this genre.,"Hi everyone! I've been recently getting into some horror stuff though I'm not sure if the stories I'll be talking about are technically horror. I wasn't sure where to post this so hopefully you can help!! 

So for context I recently got into a bad reading slump after a bad read and a long book (though I enjoyed the latter but it had  a poorly paced later half). Both of these books were fantasy btw. 

After this I decided I wanted to read some short stories but as you'll see they have a similar feel but I'm not sure what genre it categories as. So far I've essentially thought it is either existentialism or human horror (idk don't ask).

Here are the books I've read:

- the metamorphosis
- the grand inquisitor 
- I have no mouth and I must scream
- repent harlequin said the tick tocker man
- the veldt
- the lottery

1711157003.0,Recommendations for Existential/Epic/Cosmic Horror,"Topic.

I’m sorry in advance for the poor description but I’m looking for horror in the spirit of Event Horizon, Hellraiser, The Strain.

Recently I watched a show called “From” and it also captures what I’m looking for. Event Horizon is arguably not supernatural, but if it could be described as science fiction it’s certainly horrifying enough to fit the bill perfectly.

The Strain is also awesome. Especially with The Master being an ancient being, and biblical elements to it. Not a requirement by any means but that style.

The Stand by Stephen King, with its multiverse themes, kinda sorta fit the description but it’s just not scary. It’s also a virus…

Gods, aliens beyond comprehension, monsters or demons with unfathomable motive.

Again I know that’s kind of disjointed but trying to find “horror” books is such a wide range, and there’s so much stuff out there. I figured someone is into this type of horror for sure. I’m looking to build a list so by all means, overwhelm me.

Edit;

Thank you so much for all these suggestions please keep them coming. I have added everything to my list also added Hellbound Heart and Hollow Places just finished reading. Great one.",horrorlit

1711155375.0,NOS4A2 is awesome and I wish I would have read it sooner ,"I just finished this book after reading it for around two weeks, and I adored it. 

I've been in a reading block for a while now and didn't think I would finish this book because of how hefty it is (720 pages!!), but I consumed it, lol. 

It's so unique and dark in a frequently humorous, twisted way. Being able to follow the protagonist, Vic, into her imaginative childhood and the harsh realities of adulthood and parenthood made me feel invested in her character, and her journey to kill off Charlie Manx was a wild ride. 

I was connected to all of the characters (Vic, Lou, Wayne) and thought that the villains were written so wonderfully (especially Bing Partridge! Thought he was worse than Manx. What a creep)

1711154459.0,Just finished My Heart is a Chainsaw,"Hello!! I just finished My Heart is a Chainsaw after almost two and a half months. I just want to talk about it because it was,,, I don't even know what word to use. It was a confusing experience just reading it. I don't know how I feel about it and I just want to talk to people about it. 

I started reading the book on the train back after winter break. Took a month and a half to hit 100 pages. I was complaining to a friend who hasn't read it and he told me ""literally just stop reading it."" I refuse to do that because I refuse to dnf a book unless it's BAD. He opened to a random page about 1/3 of the way through and told me if it didn't get good, to just drop it. I was trudging through it a lot less when I hit that point, so I didn't drop it. Finally finished it yesterday before class. 

I thought the opening scene with the dutch kids was funny. It was very reminiscent of white authors writing Latino characters and it was really funny seeing it happen to white people. I kept sending the dutch phrases to my dutch friend, who was practically having an aneurysm over how poorly done it was. Sorry to them and to all dutch people, but it was really fucking funny. Same thing with Ezekiel and the lake. It felt a lot like an ""ancient Indian burial ground"" subversion and that's probably intentional. I think we need to start pulling some of the racist tropes in books and movies and applying them to white people.

Jade was a little annoying, but I don't think I really mind? I just read another book with an even more annoying main character, so she was a breath of fresh air after that, believe it or not. I think I was more annoyed with how all over her place her suspicions were. Like a new suspect every few paragraphs, then stuck with one suspect for a chapter, then seven new suspects in a single paragraph. I know this is kind of just was horror movies are like. I think it's just the way Jade and her thought process was written. 

All of the death scenes were super, super fun. Especially that huge massacre at the end. 

I think I'd enjoy the book more if I didn't take so long to read it. I love the other Stephen Graham Jones' other works that I've read (TOGI, The Babysitter Lives, Earthdivers). From looking around this sub for a while, it seems like a lot of other people had a hard time getting through this book which is why I wanted to talk about it. I really just want to gather my thoughts and figure out how I really feel about it so I can write a proper review on Storygraph. 

Part of me wants to know if the sequel is worth it. I've personally noticed that every horror book or movie that references Don't Fear The Reaper is typically REALLY good. I like Stephen Graham Jones. I'm fine reading books that are mediocre. I'm just worried if I ask about it here, people will talk me out of it and I do really want to read it. 

But yeah. I just want to hear other people's thoughts and talk to someone else who has actually read it. ",horrorlit

From what I’ve read about these books, I understand that not everyone is a huge fan of these authors. But, I really loved all three of these books.

Things go down hill.

Some reviewers mention this story along with The Girl Next Door which WAS made into a movie. But I think it would be harder to do with LGPATA. There are scenes where kids are torturing the naked babysitter. Yes, some of that also happens in the TGND adaptation but camera angles were very limited with cutaway shots and there was an adult instigator that the camera could stay on. In LGPATA it's ONLY KIDS torturing the babysitter. There are no adults except the babysitter who is naked most of the time. I think it would be even more challenging to film than TGND.",horrorlit

I know the background, in that the author started the story on r/nosleep so i was aware that he wasn't an author in the traditional sense and moreso someone who dabbled in writing. Even knowing this, this book is actually so badly written. There is no character development, and the book just moves from one event to another without stopping to breathe. I don't mind fast paced books if there is character development, which there is very little of in this case. It's not even scary since there is no buildup to the terror and things just happen one after the other.

From then on I highlighted any sentence about Blue that made him seem haint-like, and there were many, so that confirmed it to me before we got the canonical confirmation from Haddock's picture.

1711062059.0,"My journey to Stephen King's ""Holly"" reminded me of kindness and why I will never look at vanilla ice cream the same again","“Holly” by Stephen King was a book I couldn't wait to devour but I wanted to get into it the right way. I went on a Holly-inspired reading marathon so I could jump in and be fully caught up. I’m talking about taking an entire week off of work to enjoy a BOOKcation with everything involving Holly. That’s right ladies and gentlemen, I devoured four novels and an entire short story collection written by King that featured Holly and it was such a rewarding reading experience.  
  
Just so you know, to get the most out of “Holly” I highly recommend that you read all five books she is in before reading this novel. The order to read them are…  
  
Mr. Mercedes -> Finders Keepers -> End of Watch -> The Outsider -> If It Bleeds -> Holly  
  
Now before I jump into my review of this novel, here’s a list of the trigger warnings I found while reading…  
  
\- Homophobic comments  
\- COVID-19 pandemic  
\- Cannibalism  
\- Politics  
\- Racism  
\- Sexual harassment  
\- Rape  
\- Abortion  
\- Cancer  
\- Alzheimer’s Disease  
\- School shootings  
  
If any of these trigger you, please don’t read this novel. One more thing I’d like to mention is my thoughts on how tons of readers hated the heavy use of politics, COVID-19, masking, vaxxing, and all that jazz in this novel to the point of being rude and mean to each other due to differences of opinion.  
  
As always, reading is subjective and everyone reads for different reasons. Some like the escapism of novels and want to stay away from anything involving world and political events. Others don’t care at all and welcome it for whatever reason. Some will DNF a novel the moment they see things like that because they completely disagree and get all worked up. Others will enjoy it because they agree with that side of the debate.  
  
Whatever the case may be, do whatever makes you happy as long as it’s not at the expense of treating others badly. It’s important to remember that if readers completely disagree with King’s views on politics, masking, vaxxing, etc., it’s okay to stop reading and move on to something else. Just please don’t start attacking your fellow Constant Readers because they agree with him on these kinds of topics or vice versa. We’re all readers at heart with different genres and topics we enjoy so no need to attack or be rude to each other over political differences or how people ultimately feel about COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc.  
  
In my opinion, King is 76 years old and will be 77 years old on 9/21/24. The fact that he is still writing novels at such a high level is nothing short of incredible. I’m just glad he is because he will forever be my all-time favorite author. Regardless of how you feel about his political views and opinions on COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc., if you are a horror reader at one point or other in your life he probably gave you at least one character or book you enjoyed based on something he wrote. He’s been writing for over 50 years now and is still going strong.  
  
These trigger warnings I mentioned above don’t bother me at all since they’re just words on paper to me. Remember my friends, be kind to each other, no matter where you stand on these political and COVID topics. Whether you agree or disagree, just treat each other with kindness. Trust me, it truly goes a very long way in life.  
  
Anywho, I loved this novel so much and I would consider it one of the best he's written if you go on this Holly journey. It was that extraordinary to me and just like the other novels featuring Holly, King did a wonderful job weaving a story within a story within a story with tons of little subtle references here and there.  
  
Everything from The Princess Bride, Blood Red Sky (I loved this movie on Netflix), Freddy Krueger, Carrie (lost my mind when he did this), and even The Haunting of Hill House all made me smile. I love it when King does things like this, especially with his legendary work.  
  
The intro to “Holly” was a wild one and my goodness, King dialed up the horror with a very gross twist to things in this one. I made lots of weird faces with those insanely descriptive situations. In general, I was so happy to see Holly get her novel and not only what she’s been up to lately but also how she has evolved in the grand scheme of things.  
  
To finally get more of Holly’s backstory and fill in the gaps to what makes her tick was such a great thing to read. I have connected with Holly way before this novel came out and reading this solidified to me that she’s a rockstar. I just love the kind of person she is, how vulnerable she can be depending on what is going on at the moment, and just how she figures things out over time.  
  
Seeing Holly continuing to be Holly as she pieced things together in this horror mystery novel was a lot of fun. The suspense is throughout this novel and besides Holly, I also enjoyed how King was able to include Jerome and his sister Barbara to also get updates on them which was nice to read. This is a big reason why I highly recommend reading those five novels I mentioned above since it’ll just make it more meaningful.  
  
Besides this incredible unique and disturbing story, King did a phenomenal job breaking down an underlying tone to “Holly” that was evident throughout this novel. Seeing Holly process grief due to what she’s going through was engrossing. Everyone handles grief differently but to see such a complex and riveting character as Holly goes through this on top of trying to figure out what she’s investigating was nothing short of brilliance.  
  
It goes to show that no matter how strong, weird, or complicated someone is on the outside, grief like that affects everyone to some degree even as they vehemently deny it on the inside. Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but I just loved seeing Holly turn into the person she is now. Not only am I impressed but well, proud. I know that’ll sound weird but I went through a five-novel journey reading them all in a single week and feel like I know Holly. Even King said in recent interviews promoting this novel that there is a bit of Holly in him and well, everyone. I also feel the same as I’ve seen some of my tendencies of handling things as Holly would which makes her so relatable to me.  
  
Another thing I loved is how the presence of Bill Hodges so many moons ago impacted Holly so much that it is still helping her in the present. I swear, the quote that King put to open up this novel (“Sometimes the universe throws you a rope.” - Bill Hodges) just hits you from beginning to end. Speaking of which, my goodness, the climax to the ending was fantastic! The main antagonists in this one were pure evil and I loved how Holly handled everything in stride towards that stupendous ending.  
  
I was on the edge of my seat getting through that ending because I didn’t think that would ever happen and to see Holly do what she did make me scream YES!!! so many times in my head because it was so epic. It was quite the buildup and everything ended perfectly. I loved the ending. Mainly because it ended the way it should have when it comes to Holly and the kind of character she has now become. As always with anything I read by King, I was left mesmerized as Holly is now one of my all-time favorite characters he’s ever created.  
  
I give “Holly” by Stephen King a 5/5 as it was so worth reading all the novels Holly was in before this one was published to enjoy watching her evolve into the person she is now. The horror, creepiness, and disturbing aspects of this novel were bloody magnificent. It probably isn’t a good idea to eat or drink anything while reading this one but at the end of it all, Holly rocks. I’m so glad King decided to give this influential character her novel because this has been quite the reading journey I will never forget for the rest of my life. Finally, the last little thing King left me with besides all this awesomeness involving Holly is that I will never look at vanilla ice cream the same again. Ever.",horrorlit

Likewise the graphic novels Harrow County and The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. If you have read these and agree they fit what I'm seeking or *do not* fit, please let me know! Much appreciated in advance.

Edit: The coward crowd really came out to play while offering nothing of substance. Figures. In any case, found *Devil's Call* by J. Danielle Dorn that seems to work for the purposes I intend to use it for. Wild west witch tale and roaring rampage of revenge.",horrorlit
1711049105.0,Want to discuss with other people who have read Bunny (Mona Awad) (spoilers!!),"Yesterday there was a post asking for thoughts, if this book was worth it, but here I want to discuss with others who've read it. I just re-read it a couple days ago with knowledge of the plot twist

So Samantha is a majorly unreliable narrator, and the book gets meta and basically says it's open to interpretation. So I want to ask, how much do yall think actually happened and how much didn't? How do you make the things that supposedly didn't happen make sense?

I'm putting my questions/thoughts in a nice numbered list

1.  Was Max real, and if not, did he know Ava was a bird? Maybe he wasn't and it was actually Samantha who got revenge on the Bunnies in that way in workshop and was catfishing them all through text. But that wouldn't explain them all going crazy over Max when he actually showed up, if he didn't actually show up...
2. Did Samantha just have a bird and deer just kinda living in her house? Were those 2 different animals fucking??
3. It seems the Bunnies aren't as bad as they came across, they claimed to have tried to reach out to Samantha but she was the one who rejected them. Even then they still seemed to be pretty passive aggressive so. But their weirdness was probably over-exaggerated through Samantha's POV. Then again they kind of imply they killed Ava (an innocent bird) for Samantha's own good because she was delusional, so. Maybe they do just suck
4. I suppose when ""Rob"" came over, the Bunnies were pretending he and the other boys were there while only Samantha actually saw them. And she ""outsourced"" her own thoughts/internal conflict to him, when he was screaming at her before his head exploded
5. What exactly were the pills they kept pushing?
6. What was with Ava abandoning/ignoring Samantha for 2 weeks and not knowing why she'd be mad afterwards, especially if Ava wasn't even real? Perhaps Samantha just didn't see the swan around and then happened to see it that day, and imagined the whole conversation. Of course a bird has no concept of abandoning a person or knowing why that'd upset them
7. How did the Bunnies and Ava have a conversation in the diner? And then Ava and Eleanor having a conversation outside, was she just talking to a bird on her own?
8. What ever DID happen between Samantha and Lion? Maybe he wasn't even being weird/distant to her, but she was being weird/distant to him. Like how she rejected the Bunnies but turned it around in her head to them rejecting her
9. What actually went on in the Committee Meeting where Samantha was tied up by the hybrids if there were no hybrids? When the janitor ""freed"" her it turned out she wasn't all that tied up, so maybe nothing happened at all and she just made it up in her head
10. They were (or so they claim) just pretending turning bunnies into boys(hybrids), but were actual bunnies actually involved? Were they actually axe-ing bunnies? Or maybe just had them hopping around pretending they were ""hybrids"" for fun and Samantha made up the axe and exploding part

Honestly lots of things make more sense if these people could actually turn animals into people. And maybe they could, it's open to interpretation! So, what's yall's interpretations?",horrorlit

The crew all hates him because he's a weirdo and he's not as smart as they are, but he never chose to be the way he is, and they've intentionally modified themselves to be freaks. In the context of the book he's more human than any of them.

The book gave me a minor existential crisis, it made me wonder if I'm really properly sentient and conscious or if my brain is just pretending that I am and I'm really just a meat GPT that is convincingly mimicking consciousness.

1710950533.0,Good/Bad audiobook narrators,"So I was recommended Mexican Gothic by somebody I known in person. I found it on Libby and rented it immediately. 

This narrator is the absolute worst and I don't think I can continue. I'm about 3 hours in with 7 or 8 to go.

She has the same inflection for every sentence and it is driving me nuts to the point im irrationally angry. I can't even belive its making me feel this way. Even if it's a two word sentence like ""She babbled"", the narrator does it in the same airy voice the exact same way as every other sentence.

Has anybody else listened to this book as opposed to reading it? I always have 1 audiobook and 1 physical book going at the same time and my physical book backlog is already miles long so I'll never get around to reading it.


Are there any other books you would highly recommend due to the narrator or any books you would not recommend due to the narrator? Would love a discussion about good/bad narrators


Top of my head, books I recall loving partly due to superb narration is:

11/22/63 - Stephen King

The Last House on Needless Street - Catriona Ward

The Exorcist - William Peter Blatty


I don't know if I just didn't like the book or if the narration was part of it but I did not enjoy listening to In Cold Blood - Truman Capote

1710947675.0,What are some of the best horror stories written by non white authors? ,"Been making efforts to broaden my horizons and read more variety. 


I’ve really enjoyed Tananarive Due (“the between” actually scared me, and I’ve enjoyed almost everything else I’ve read of hers). I also enjoyed Stephen Graham Jones, though his books didn’t scare me I really liked his writing style. And I tried some Octavia Butler, Victor LaValle, and P Djèli Clark. 

And I wouldn’t bill his stuff as horror, but I’m absolutely captivated by James Baldwin’s writing style. 

But it seems really tough to pin down reading recs from poc authors, specifically within the horror genre.

So what are some horror stories by non white authors that you’d highly recommend? 


EDIT: 

FIRST off, thank you to all these amazing commenters, and this incredible collection of recommendations! I've been trying to read more variety for the past year or so and any time I hit the library or book store asking for horror stories by non white authors, I pretty much just get blank stares. Librarians and clerks try to help, but the pool is so small (and under celebrated) that they're simply at a loss. You all have expanded my reading list by a couple hundred percents in mere days and I appreciate your recs!

SECOND:


several people have expressed bewilderment and confusion and what seems to be a sort of defensive accusation as to why I'd care about the race of the author... To be clear, this request is NOT anti white. I am white. 


If you're willing to be a little open minded, here are my reasons for asking for these recs:

A while back I learned that non white authors are statistically underrepresented in the US publishing markets, and this lack of representation is especially obvious within the horror genre.

As with many fields in the US there are socioeconomic barriers, or at least obstacles, to traditional publishing which POC face in disproportionately high degrees, as compared to white people. 


After learning about this inequity, I evaluated my own book lists on goodreads. My favorites were all white, in fact my broader reading list was also almost all white. And, incidentally, almost all men. 


As a white man, and a writer, this offended my sense of fairness. I love writing and dream of one day ""Making It"" as an author. But I don't like playing in a rigged system. 

I've always thought of myself as fairly socially minded and progressive, and informed.

To address the dissonance between my stated values and my oblivious reading history, I realized I had to expand my horizons. 

I decided to deliberately seek out works from authors who didn't look like me. I can't single handedly prompt a system wide change in terms of equity and inclusion in publishing. But I can damn sure put my meager dollars (and my time) towards leveling the playing field in terms of what books make it onto my shelf. 

So I'm looking for recs to make my reading base more diverse! It's been worthwhile so far as I've encountered perspectives that are new or challenging and in so doing discovered several new favorite authors!

tldr: if your knee jerk reaction to this innocent reading request is to get offended on behalf of white people, try to let go of that. I'm white and far more offended by the existing inequalities that would make a question like this not only controversial but necessary.",horrorlit

1710889720.0,The Haunting of Hill House: Show vs. Book (and general book discussion),"I know a lot of people say the book and show are nothing alike, but coming from the show to the book I feel like I noticed so many similarities and was hoping others felt the same. 

1. Eleanor Vance (EV) in the book seemed like a combination of Olivia Crain and Eleanor Crain Vance (ECV) in the show. The house gets in her head as it does to Olivia, but also it craves her and calls to her like it does to EV. 
2. I also think their endings are quite similar! The dancing, climbing up the stairs. For ECV this is the real end, but EV gets snapped out of it and ECV doesn't even realize what she's doing until it's too late. But they both experience that moment of regret when they realize it's truly the end. Also ECV comes back to Hill house as an adult because she was searching for something and felt like she had nothing at home, and that's how EV comes too
3. The biggest thing I felt like I couldn't untangle was how the show portrays time. I never got the ECV line out of my head ""our moments fall around us like rain"" and so I couldn't help but project that on to the book. The common explanations I see for the phenomena in the book is that it's either in EV's head, EV has some sort of telekinetic powers, or of course you can take it at face value that it was haunted by the ghosts of the Crains. In light of the show's explanation about time, what if the haunting was EV the whole time? Future ghost EV who would be trapped in his house for eternity was haunting (and taunting) living EV. 
   1. If you buy that, what if what Theodora saw when she told EV to run was Eleanor herself, having a picnic now that she was part of hill house 
4. I also liked the subtle connections, like the cup of stars, EV attachment to her mother's watch like ECV was attached to Olivia's necklace, the ""come home Nell in chalk"", I also liked how the part when EV listens on everyone conversations but not one mentions here is a good parallel to the show when little Nellie becomes invisible and is screaming but no one can hear her.

Just about the book

1. I was picking up how strange the dialogue was and how the characters seem to respond to Eleanor's thoughts (at first I thought this was because Theodora is somewhat psychic but then Luke started doing it too). I also picked up how they seemed to just start calling her Nell and Nellie one day pretty sporadically. She never mentions that as a nickname. Was that common enough in the 1960s that people just knew Eleanors were also called Nellie and I'm reading too much into it, or can that be seen as an example of them getting too connected to Eleanor?
2. The part when Eleanor is talking about ""surrendering"" to the house and Luke and the Doctor say she's been saying stuff like this before, was that a part that I missed or was it something the narrator never said? ",horrorlit

My best theories were that >! Rory is actually her half brother because his father had an affair with Dixie's mom which resulted in baby Dixie but when the mom wouldn't be with him and witheld his child from him, he murdered her family and made the dad watch by cutting his throat so he could see them all while bleeding out slowly.

1710864960.0,Seven Cleopatra Hill was a jam-packed 5-Star horror novel that completely surprised me,"“Seven Cleopatra Hill” by Justin Holley is truly a jam-packed horror novel that takes the haunted house/motel style of writing to a whole new level. This was an exciting read from start to finish with excellent characters, scary encounters, and a ton of gore. This was a very well-written novel that I felt was a diamond in the rough when it comes to how many haunted houses/motels are out there. This one stands out from the rest and holds its own as a very unique take in this subgenre of horror.  
  
I loved all the unique characters as they were nicely developed with the kids being my favorite ones. Miles was by far my favorite character and he’s just a kid! All the creepy situations in this novel were built up and delivered a knockout of a horror reading experience. I particularly enjoyed the pacing of the story as nothing dragged on at all, every word mattered and in 30 chapters, there was zero fluff here.  
  
Don’t worry, I will not ruin anything for you as I want readers to be immersed and see all the different layers of suspense and horror that await. Even the gore in this novel added to the horror aspect of things as it was pretty tense in every encounter as things revealed themselves naturally. I had no idea where things would go and loved every minute of that feeling of not knowing what would happen until it was over.  
  
Also, I’m usually not into romance when it comes to the horror novels I read but it was done very well in “Seven Cleopatra Hill” where it wasn’t overbearing at all. It didn’t take anything away from the story and I appreciated that as it added more substance and drama to things.  
  
Once I hit the 80% mark, the race to the climactic ending was a fantastic journey as I loved how Holley was able to keep me on the edge of my seat as to what was ultimately going to transpire. The ending was beyond satisfying and a perfect way to wrap up this horror novel that will be one I remember for many years to come.  
  
This may come as no surprise but I give “Seven Cleopatra Hill” by Justin Holley a perfect 5/5 as he has a new fan in me. I look forward to reading his previous and future work as he’s an incredibly talented writer.

1710862515.0,Trying to track down a vampire novel I read in the early '00s.,"SOLVED. See edit below for the answer.

I'm looking for a novel from the '90s or early '00s in which vampirism is a disease or hereditary condition. 

* It's more suspense/thriller than horror or pulp. 
* I'm fairly certain gargoyles also figure into the novel in some way, but I don't recall whether they're alive or just symbolism.
* The dust jacket may have had a gargoyle on the cover, though I can't swear to it. 
* It's set in a present day city. 
* It may have involved porphyria.
* It absolutely cannot have been published any later than 2005.

Things I've ruled out: Charlie Huston, Brian Lumley, The Strain, V:tM books, Fledgling, and horror/urban fantasy in the Anita Blake/Buffy/Sonja Blue realm. 

Any help would be appreciated. I've been trying to figure this out for more than a decade now.

ETA:
It took digging through all the titles tagged ""vampires"" on ISFDb, but I think I figured it out: The specific scenes I could picture are from Elizabeth Kostova's The Historian, and the details that don't fit are probably from Andrei Codrescu's The Blood Countess or other vampire-related books I read at the time.",horrorlit

1710842419.0,Just finished Mongrels. My thoughts on the novel and Stephen Graham Jones.,"SPOILER FREE: 

&#x200B;

Okay so here's the deal: Stephen Graham Jones is an insanely polarizing author. People either love his work or they can't get through it. His writing style is extremely unique. 

&#x200B;

I view at like this: SGJ writes like people think. His prose follows internal narrative (from the books that I have read) and the narration will follow the plot and then branch off to a related thought that lasts almost pages at a time, and THEN brought back to the main plot written about. It's not necessarily stream-of-consciousness, its more of a ""oh hey I had this thought while writing this passage. There's a lot more to it and I'm going to keep going to finish out this thought. I'm not sure if it actually has to do with the narrative, but let me get back to what I was talking about"". And he does so without page breaks or dingbats; he regularly continues the narrative in the following paragraph. It's unapologetically disorienting. 

&#x200B;

But, that's him. He does his thing and at the of it says ""fuck it"". You like or you don't. 

&#x200B;

Now, I just finished ""Mongrels"". I'd like to state that I have read ""The Only Good Indians"", ""Night of the Mannequins"", and ""My Heart is a Chainsaw"". The first being superb; I read it in two days. I could not put it down. And then I got to the basketball match and the ending chase and was extremely disappointed. The first two acts were fucking fantastic, and then completely fizzled out during the basketball scene (I have since understood that basketball is huge within the indigenous community, still wasn't fun to read) and overly drawn out chase afterwards. 

&#x200B;

""Night of the Mannequins"" was a really fun novella surrounding an unreliable narrator (my favorite device). He did an excellent job with the small amount of space he occupied. 

&#x200B;

I felt ""My Hear is a Chainsaw"" was one of the most masturbatory pieces of fiction I ever read. Being a narrative from a teenager obsessed with horror movies, every two pages is riddled with slasher references. It's endearing at first, then she just continues AD NAUSEAM in referencing 'obscure' slashers (Holy fuck, you'll read an endless supply of Billy and Stu references). The narrative took about 200 pages to get anywhere; anything before it was analyses of classic slashers. It just felt like SGJ saying ""Hey look how much I know about these movies and what they actually mean"" rather than paying attention to the characterization and narrative (which he's usually very good at). I would have DNF'd it if I hadn't read it on a plane. Then end is kind of awesome and bonkers, but doesn't make up for the mundane first two-thirds.

&#x200B;

And now I just finished ""Mongrels"". It's a solid werewolf novel. It subverts a lot of previously established werewolf traits. The narrator is an adolescent expecting to turn werewolf and follows his aunt and uncle; two experienced werewolves. The whole novel kind of presents itself as a collection of vignettes of this teenager understanding all the attributes of being a werewolf before he shifts. It's endearing at first; as the reader we're exposed to a slew of unfamiliar characteristics of being a werewolf. But that's kind of the whole novel. Each chapter is the narrator at a different age experiencing something different. There's not really a whole narrative arc, if you will. It's more of a ""this is how werewolves live"". Which isn't really a bad thing, but it presents itself as a whole narrative following this family and fails to live up to it. And maybe that's the point? It feels like a giant metaphor for how Native Americans live in America today as outcasts and shunned. It's done well and not shoved down your throat. However, there's not really a narrative; it's about the characters. And god damnit, his characters are FANTASTIC. That's the reason I kept reading. I really wanted to know what happened to these outcasts. At the end of the day I won't care about your narrative unless you make me care about your characters, and he does a phenomenal job of making me give a shit about his characters. It's written well (he knows what he's doing), I read it in three days. Just don't go in expecting a central story, look at it as a documentary about a family of werewolves.

&#x200B;

I most certainly will not stop reading him, he has a great talent. His short stories are included in a myriad of Ellen Datlow collections. But he's not for everyone. And maybe that's what I appreciate the most: he's doing something different, unapologetically. ",horrorlit

I don’t want to name the author and put them on blast but I’ve noticed this with a few of the modern horror books lately. This was riddled with nonsensical sentences, grammatical errors, choppy paragraphs with random facts thrown in, etc etc. It read like a first draft—I had to keep checking to make sure I didn’t accidentally buy an ARC. I had heard so many good things about this author beforehand (even from this sub). I wish I would have read the reviews first because quite a few of people shared my perspective. 

Are they using AI to edit their work or something? Are editors pushed to the limit so much so that the work suffers from it? Or is this simply a writing style that I just don’t jive with? I’d love to hear if anyone else has experienced this because I felt like I was going crazy. 

Edit: I mistakenly thought this was through a traditional publisher but after some research I found it’s an imprint of Amazon Publishing (so probably self-published).

I’ve gone through two of her other works, but The End Of Alice seems to be the only one that sticks in the vein of being outright disturbing, which is the biggest appeal for me. I’m hoping someone here might have any recommendations for something similar in both writing style and the horror element?

1710695192.0,Fairy Tale is an unforgettable novel where reality blurs into fantasy with a splash of horror,"“Fairy Tale” by Stephen King was such a delight to read, it’s something you just need to sit back, relax, and enjoy slowly in stride. I loved how as always with King, he brings you back to a time when you were a kid and had to deal with all the usual things kids dealt with. Relationships, sports, family, friends, doing stupid things, and just trying to make sense of it all.  
  
I loved all the characters King created in this novel. Charlie, Mr. Bowditch, Leah, and even the fantasy characters were all fantastic. Now, for me personally, when it comes to Radar, I became a dog owner for the first time in my life back in 2021 as she connected with me. I have a cockapoo by the name of Ozzy Skywalker and reading about Radar hit home for me in so many ways.  
  
All the interactions, situations, events, and descriptions were exactly that of a dog and how a dog owner would react. I can imagine if you’re also a dog owner, you will feel the same way as you connect immediately with the dynamic duo of Charlie and Radar and the adventures that await them.  
  
Don’t worry, I will not ruin anything for you but this novel is simply amazing. The way King blurred reality into fantasy completely blew me away. Even all the scary and horror situations were perfect that led to an awesome fairy tale story that was unique and just so good. The atmosphere, world-building, character development, and the pure creepiness of everything King built just really resonated well with me. Once I got to the 80% mark, it was incredibly hard to put this down to see what would ultimately transpire.  
  
Also, the illustrations for each chapter brought me back to my childhood as I remembered reading a lot of horror and mystery novels that did this. I have no idea who created these graphics for King in every chapter but they were great and captured the essence of each one. As I read, I’d often head back to see the image just to give me that visual as it happened. So well done!  
  
When it comes to the ending, it delivered after such a climactic buildup. I had no idea what would transpire but when it did, my goodness, it was wonderful and wrapped up an unforgettable novel. It was simply a perfect way to end things that left me beyond satisfied.

1710656615.0,Happy Horror? Looking for recommendations,"As the title says, I'm fancying something terrifying/disturbing, with elements including abuse and disturbing emotions, maybe some bits of dysfunctional family, also maybe a focus on too much money/dirty rich family/or no money at all. I've enjoyed VC Andrews books for example, however I found those to be a bit too focused on family dynamics and redundant after awhile. I enjoy feeling scared but also with parts that are enjoyable - money, success, love, goals, friendship, etc. I want to feel excited and happy at times too. Existential/cosmic horror would be amazing if included too!

Unfortunately the only thing I can really reference that I feel had all of these parts was a manga called Takopi's Original Sin.

It becomes clear that they’re traveling past or are stuck in traffic, near the gates of hell but they’ve not got there by accident (?), they just live in this surreal, cruel, disturbing realm and dreadful things are happening but the kid is taking them in her (?) stride and just recounting the events in a, “what we did on our holiday”, fashion ",horrorlit

1710645774.0,The Long and Hungry Road,"I haven't heard much from any community about this short story and I just want to give props to three author; Adrian Tchaikovsky, for creating a true Eldritch Horror story that is dripping with dread and horror told from the perspective of the Eldritch monsters. 

Most Warhammer novels are very hit and miss when it comes to quality but I do find most entertaining popcorn reading. This short story manages to really dive into the unknown, the horror, and the almost absent mindedness of an entity as it devours a world. It cuts to a few characters and their struggles before jumping back into the perspective of the Tyranids and how mundane their actions are. 

Please, if you enjoy Eldritch sci-fy horror please spend the $4 on kindle to read this story. It's amazing and I think more authors should try to emulate the perspective of the Tyranids in this book to add horror to their monsters. Also if you have any recommendations where the story has perspectives from the monsters please let me know.  I'd love to check them out. ",horrorlit

As an example, the above is the reason I loved the book version of the Shining so much- Jack's drinking problem and history of abuse was made worse by the supernatural influence of the hotel and the isolation of the setting made BOTH parts of the horror scarier (both being trapped with malevolent spirits who wish you harm AND being trapped with an abusive spouse/parent).",horrorlit

Quarter Book Check In

I am absolutely conflicted about Margaret, the main character. She reminds me of my mother, with all her language correction. At first I was kind of with her, as an agnostic millennial, if I had my dream house and it happened to be a little haunted, so be it! Fredericka seems like more of a blessing than a curse if you ask me. Can you imagine having a live in maid that you didn’t have to pay? A live in best friend too? 

I can’t seem to find the word for Margaret — aloof? Distracted? Unenthused? Her husband just DISAPPEARS and all she cares about is keeping her daughter Katherine away. She’s casually digging up bones to keep a prankster ghost away for a week. Is she hiding something? Great writing so far.

End of book thoughts
That was literally the best ending to a horror book I’ve ever read. Oh, my god. I don’t care if it sounds childish, a happy ending never disappoints. I found this book through a kind stranger on Reddit and they hit the bullseye. This is such a good read. Even though there wasn’t necessarily as much gore or incredible action throughout the first 3/4 of the book, I still found it held my attention firmly with the scares and twists it did give. I loved this book because I thoroughly expected the ending to be completely different than what it ended up being. Some authors don’t necessarily achieve that peak of anticipation that I was seeking, and this book did. If you love haunted homes, if you love ghosts with ghastly injuries displaying their moments of death, if you love weird characters that you fall in love with, this book is for you. I feel a little bad for doubting Margaret in the middle of the book. I really did want to think she was just insane. I could have accepted that ending. But what actually happened is so much better.

Questions & Highlights I had after finishing this book:
- Why wasn’t Hal present in the spirits at the end of the book while they chased out Master Vale? Is he in “hell” for being abusive?
- Why didn’t Jones die the same way as the other officers, the house choosing to spare her. Perhaps to tell the story?
- I wish I could listen to the song. You know the one.
- I can’t believe that McDouglas was going to shoot Margaret. What a loser.
- Do you think Fredericka will stay and roam the home after her “rest”? I’d like to think so. That even after she’d been freed, she’d still enjoy going about her daily routines.
- Katherine finally believe her mom.<3
- Needs must when the Devil drives.

1710600324.0,Woom is a wild and extreme splatterpunk ride that will leave its mark on you,"“Woom” by Duncan Ralston is just one of those short stories you have to read it to believe it. I love horror as it’s my favorite genre to read but when it comes to extreme horror, this one pushes the envelopes to realms that will offend readers.  
  
There is a TON of graphic and sexual violence here as this is not for the faint of heart. Don’t eat or drink anything as you read this because it’ll gross you out beyond words. Yeah, it’s that extreme, wild, unpredictable, and will leave its mark if you’re able to finish it. LoL there should be an achievement or something to finish reading this in its entirety because I have friends and even read reviews that “Woom” is so extreme that many couldn’t even finish it.  
  
It’s creepy, weird, gross, and beyond extreme that the ending was so unexpected I was completely shocked. I won’t ruin anything for you but once everything unfolds, you’ll also be making some weird faces as you read. It’s just too crazy, you know? I enjoyed all the cryptic chapters and it just really blew my mind that Ralston could come up with a short story that is so twisted and quick to read.  
  
I give “Woom” by Duncan Ralston a 4/5 and would recommend this to any reader that is looking for extreme, shocking, and crazy horror. It was very well written, had some nice twists, and the ending was pretty intense. The only thing I didn’t like was how this story had several mini-stories inside of it to explain characters, situations, and events with one I didn’t like.  
  
The majority were great but there was one I found a bit confusing and felt was a bit out of place. Aside from that, this was a solid read that I enjoyed and will remember for many years to come. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take a long shower after reading everything that happened in Room 6 of The Lonely Motel.",horrorlit

I'm looking for things that a true ghost stories. I like haunted house and urban legend stuff like that. I also like those ""spooky"" psychological thrillers-- something like  ""Hide and Seek"" or ""Dream House"" (movies for reference). I generally do not like when real people are meant to be the scary part like slasher or murderer stuff, and Stephen King doesn't do it for me, to give a frame of reference on the opposite end.

1710576739.0,Historical Horror recommendations?,"I am on a historical horror kick. Realistic, fantasy, spiritual. I love it all! The nastier the better as it’s hard for me to stay entranced in my horror if I’m not disturbed the whole time. I also enjoy the history overall and the extra effort made by the characters given the specific struggles of the time periods. As of right now, I have a clear preference for medieval, but I’ve been also open to diving into other historical themes as well.

Carmilla, Sheridan Le Fanu
Lapvona, Ottessa Moshfegh
Between Two Fires, Christopher Buehlman
Tender Is The Flesh, Agustina Bazterrica
Orlando, Virginia Woolf (Not horror, but good!)
His Black Tongue, Mitchell Luthi 

And then I read every single one of Jesse Bullington’s books (The Sad Tale Of The Brothers Grossbart, The Enterprise Of Death, and The Folly Of The World). His books are my all time favorite.

","I just finished reading Old Country by Matt and Harrison Query, I did enjoy it, despite finding some of the dialogue a bit dry or clichéd. My little review is a solid 3.5/5, loved the atmosphere, I think the way the scenery was described was almost the most effective part of the novel! In fact, I picked it up due to the cover selling it as a bit of a ranch horror. Harry and Sasha, at points, did slightly cringe me out lol. I also want to mention that pretty much all of the characters were very stereotypical but, for some reason, I absolutely enjoyed reading it. I think the enjoyment came from the atmosphere created and the imagery of these scenic mountains with secluded ranches and the ‘riding ponies and sippin beer on the porch’ kinda vibes e. I was a fan of the simplicity of the writing, too. I have been super busy and tired recently and having an easy read that still managed to be spooky and unsettling has been great for me!!

1710524801.0,What types of protagonist would you like to see more of in horror novels?,"I feel like a lot of horror books have similar types of main characters. Financially struggling college students/young adults, people who’ve experienced loss (often the death of a spouse or child), people estranged from their families, people trapped in abusive relationships, male protagonist who’s kind of a loser, etc.

And it makes sense. Horror and grief/struggles go hand in hand. There’s a lot to work with, but sometimes I want something else.

I recently binge watched Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, and I’d be extremely interested in reading about someone like Gus Fring or Lalo Salamanca dealing with supernatural evil, demons or gross fleshy tentacle monsters.

I’d be especially interested if the protagonist was female. Give me aggressive women who aren’t afraid to get violent. Maybe she’s a high level drug distributor involved or allied with the cartel. Maybe she’s a street level dealer, or maybe she’s a trailer park queen who’s been in her fair share of bar fights and knocked out people’s teeth. Maybe she’s just the school bully. I want female protagonists who are rough around the edges. Violent women exist in real life, and I think it’d be really interesting to read a book with one as the protagonist.

I'm looking for a speciffic kind of horror book, if it exists, that I'm having trouble finding.

I love a good atmosphere, the sense of dread, a good mystery above all. 

The specific themes I'm looking fore come from the following pieces of media:

- Alan Wake 2 - if you played the video game I'm talking about Alan's part of the game, the dark, hard boiled neon-lit city, horrors lurking in the dark, the psychological turmoil and cosmic horror elements, cults (I LOVE cults)

-True Detective - season 1 of course. Everything about the show is I think my favorite piece of media ever. The insanely gripping atmosphere, the serial killer, Carcosa (Yellow King reference), all of it is perfect

- The Cthulhu Mythos - specifically the Shadow Over Innsmouth story is just... The unknowable looming terror, the paranoia, madness, fog filled fishing town that harbors a deep dark secret. I only read the Crhulhu Mythos so any other suggestions are welcome

- Se7en - perfect movie by David Fincher, absolutely devours you with the atmosphere and the music, the ritualistic killings in a rainy seedy city, what's not to love?

I think you can see a common thread. I can dig it realistic or supernatural, but atmosohere and a good driving mystery is the most important (if it has rituals and cults you can bet your bottom I'll check it out)

1710485890.0,The Devil Takes You Home by Gabino Igelsias. Just finished. A bit disappointed. SPOILERS,"Bought this one a while ago because it came up in multiple ""books like True Detective"" threads in this sub. 

**Positives:**  The occult, the cartel, and the region's centuries long history of ritualistic violence and suffering seems to go untapped in horror lit and horror movies, so glad to see someone tackle it.  

Iglesias did an *impressive* job taking a normal guy, tragically having his daughter suffer, have him resort to crime to financially prevent her suffering, his crimes escalate to murder, his daughter dies, he abuses his wife for the first time, she leaves him and he is left with nothing all in under *20 pages* with me believing it all and feeling for the main character. *Very* well done. 

**Other than that:**  What am I missing here? Why is this being compared to True Detective?

It's an incredibly violent story but at the end nobody is redeemable or likable. It's ultimately kind of pointless other than the thrill of the violence and betrayal.

There also seemed to be an underlying self-hatred coming from the characters and the author himself, similar to Roberto Bolano's *2666*, but Bolano at least was up front about it. He was very candid about his home country being unrecognizable and wasn't the place he loved and remembered growing up in.

**Lastly:**  Post-Trump racism was a huge part thematically but seemed to just fall flat. I kept expecting the tables to turn but they never did. The white guys in the book are racist assholes but they never actually *do* anything bad. The other characters talk about how bad they are, but they themselves and the people they're associated with do far more horrific things.

1710459185.0,“The Good House” is one of the most original haunted house/voodoo novels I've ever read,"“The Good House” by Tananarive Due is a slow-build kind of novel that builds up into a solid haunted house novel that checks off most of the boxes you’re looking for when it comes to this kind of horror. If you want to read about evil spirits, voodoo, and some pretty memorable characters and events, you’ll genuinely enjoy this one.  
  
This was the first novel I’ve ever read by Due as I love her writing style. All the characters are well done, places across Sacajawea were very descriptive, and of course, the center of this, the house itself, were all great. There is a ton of creepy horror here and even though I won’t ruin it for you, there are plenty of moments that will creep you out.  
  
I also loved all the Stephen King novel references as that was a nice touch as he’s my all-time favorite author. Besides all that, I did feel this novel could have been trimmed down just a bit more as some of the dialogue and situations were a bit repetitive. It starts slow, builds up nicely, then starts to level out as I kept waiting for more horror and big events to happen. Once they eventually did, I felt it took a bit too long to get there.  
  
The different layers to the overall story arc were all brilliantly written. I enjoyed how the chapters kept going back and forth from the past to the present with major events happening and then reading about what happened to fill in the important gaps. Again, it’s extremely hard to write this in a way that doesn’t feel confusing or annoying. I give much respect to Due for writing this to where it just all makes sense, especially with a wild, tension-filled ending that was fantastic.  
  
Overall, I give “The Good House” a 4/5. It’s a memorable horror novel with the only knock on it being I felt this could have probably been cut by 100 pages and still delivered an amazing reading experience. Either way, I genuinely enjoyed it and would recommend this to anyone looking for a good haunted house novel with a voodoo twist.",horrorlit

1710449733.0,Seeking adventure-fantasy-horror recs!,"So, I’ve just read The Nighthouse Keeper by Lora Senf, the sequel to The Clackity. Both are middle grade, but I heard about The Clackity on the podcast Talking Scared and decided to check it out. In addition, I really liked This Appearing House by Ally Malinenko. 

I’m looking for similar books- all of the ones I’ve mentioned are DEFINITELY horror, but they also have some extremely cool and almost cozy other-world fantasy quest vibes- think A Wrinkle In Time, actually, which certainly has horrific stuff in it. I know many recs like this will be MG or at least YA, which I’m totally open to. 

The last element I loved about these books is the emphasis on horror reflecting the protagonist’s mental state or obstacles they have to overcome. In This Appearing House, the obstacles our MC encounters are related to her accepting and acknowledging her cancer diagnosis, and in Senf’s Blight Harbor series we see our MC grow more confident as she battles manifestations of her anxiety.

1710448885.0,Fantasticland thoughts (spoilers),"I just finished Fantasticland after seeing it recommended here a lot and it was right up my alley. I especially liked that any SA was implied and though I definitely think it occurred, the threat and implications were more than enough considering the heavy gore otherwise. Most discussions of the book on here are pretty old so I’m making a new post in case anyone is willing to discuss a few things with me beyond the posts about the warthogs that seem to crop up quite often. 

First thing that stuck with me was small but (I felt) interesting- Riley’s hostility toward Cristobal (according to Cristobal). I thought this was an effective and subtle way of emphasizing the wild group affiliations, since he was technically a joiner rather than a member. Also, coming right after Jill’s section, it gives us a (possibly more realistic) view of the Deadpool’s leadership, since Riley’s attitude and choices result in many, many more casualties than, say, Elvis’s leadership. Some of this is geographical obviously, but it’s also evident that things would have played out differently for the Deadpools if they had a leader like Elvis. It feels like there are parallels between Riley and Clara’s leadership, with maybe the women leaders feeling more at risk and reactive to the Pirates threat on account of the way the violence is gendered (“how much for the girl?”- girls going missing- Elvis’s girlfriend’s murder- etc). Because of this, the women leaders stoke the fire started by Brock, while Elvis and Glenn seem less reactive and more defensive. 

The other thing I wanted to discuss is that I disagree with the criticism that Brock’s character is flat. I actually felt the book does a great job showing how infectious the atmosphere of the Pirates would be, a chance to alleviate fear through shared purpose and action. Brock understands how to commandeer and manipulate people. I didn’t think the interview portion with him was necessary but the way he shows up and is portrayed in the various other stories was great.

1710428866.0,Having a hard time finishing Return to the Black Farm,"I just started reading this after finishing the Black Farm not too long ago. The problem I'm having is that the main character comes off stupid and selfish. So much so that it's frustrating to me that he doesn't understand the ramifications of actions and how short sighted it is.

The idea that the MC and his wife have just learned about the existence of heaven and hell as well as a demiplane of purgatory just set aside for the suicidals and simply go back to normal is baffling. Not to mention literally every problem is solved by a threat or a basic act of violence.

Dude toppled a demiplane of existence disrupting a cosmic balance and is just like ""not my problem"" after fundamentally being explained to that it is his problem is the point I put it down.

1710391383.0,Just finished Baby Teeth by Zoje Stage..?,"Let me start off with this, I really enjoyed this book. I might spoil it, so don’t read on if you plan on picking up this book. 

I enjoyed reading this, but I’m confused about a few things and wondered if other people noticed them.

Firstly, I felt like Hanna’s intelligence was inconsistent. I don’t exactly know how to explain this, because I know the idea was that she’s much too smart for her age. But there were just times where I got the feeling she didn’t understand certain things for the plot’s sake. It was obvious enough to be annoying. 

Secondly, Suzette was not a great mother, but again the damage done to Hanna felt inconsistent to her behavior. She had a deep, burning hatred for Suzette that wasn’t earned in my opinion. I don’t know if the author was trying to insinuate that there was something deeply wrong or that Suzette caused it? I was confident it was a mixture of both, but near the end of the book I couldn’t help side with Suzette. 

Some of the most frustrating parts: why not just videotape Hanna without her knowledge? Did Hanna HAVE to have unwavering hatred for her mother simply existing at all times(it got annoying)? I can forgive Alex for not believing his wife(just one person), but every school and baby sitter was lying too?? The constant back and forth competition Suzette was having with a 7 year old to win some dumb fight that wouldn’t even benefit her! 

Lastly, the ending felt abrupt to me. Like Stage was leaving it open for a sequel. I’m not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn’t that Hanna would be stuck at Marshes. 

I would love to hear how you guys interpreted the book and maybe could clear up any of my confusion?

P.s. I sympathize with both characters. Obviously, Hanna learned to mask her behavior from her mother. But I believe Suzette was valid in wanting her marriage to be the way it was before. ",horrorlit

Most of the others on my list were Stephen King, which I think fit the genre, but I think he gets more than enough attention.



Books I'd highly recommend:

House of leaves - M Z Danielewski: I haven't read anything like it. The use of text was done in a way that didn't feel gimmicky and the story was good. It felt a little slow to start but had me hooked.

Sour Candy - K P Burke: This story was out there. I loved it. Crazy, creepy, and unpredictable. It made me want to read a lot more of his work. His style is entralling and with his story length nothing drags on too long.

There is No Antimemetics Division - Qntm: This one was wild. I wasn't as familiar with SCP, but I immediately wanted to know everything about the universe created. It kept me guessing and thought it was very well done.

Penpal - D Auerbach: One of the creepier books I've read and its presented in a way where I was dying to know more. I saw a spoiler about half way through and still thought it was great.

Winterset Hollow - J E Durham: Starts calm but then takes a turn in the best way. Not what I saw coming, and one of those times where you might not necessarily be on the side of the main characters

We Have Always Lived In The Castle - S Jackson: Jackson is excellent at short and unsettling. It still felt like a slow burn despite the length. I knew the ending, but still had an impact.

Migrations - C McConaghy: Bleak and depressing but well done. Not the ending I thought was coming but it all stuck with me for a bit after reading.

The Ruins - S Smith: Tense and claustrophobic for a setting thats almost entirely outside. I thought it was pretty unsettling at times and a lot of scenes really worked.

Last Days / No One Gets Out Alive / The Ritual - A Nevill: These have a but, however I liked them enough that they're still in this section. All of them are borderline scary for me and I was on the edge of my seat ... until the last section on all of them. They go off the rails and don't really recover for me. Still worth it.

Tender Is The Flesh - A Bazterrica: Love the idea. I think it was over hyped in terms of shock factor, but it was still intense. The ending still got me.

A Short Stay In Hell - S L Peck: Amazing. Short but powerful and another one I still think about. It gets a lot of praise on here and it's well deserved. Great concept. Great execution.

Between Two Fires - C Buelman: Overrated and Underrated. This was one of my favorites of the year. It was a beautiful book that hit in a way I wasn't expecting. Made me buy more of his work.

The Exorcist - W P Blatty: Great story. A classic for a reason. However, much like seeing the movie decades after its release, the scare wasn't completely there for me. I wanted it to be the book to really scare me this year but alas, maybe next year.



Books I'd recommend, but ...:

Survivor Song - P Tremblay: I love a good outbreak story and this was an intetesting take. I like Tremblay's style and his books are quick reads, but the main character gets a bit grating.

Cabin At The End of The World - P Tremblay: Great concept but it drags a bit. I would have expected a better ending with the way it lingers, but a little unsatisfying. Overall a good enough read though.

A Head Full Of Ghosts - P Tremblay: Similar to the others, a quick read and very interesting, but the blog is pretty annoying. I didn't want to skip anything but it probably wouldn't hurt.

The Kraken Wakes / The Day of the Triffids - J Wynham: Really interesting reads. Great plots with a different take on things. Even though they were short, I felt like they dragged a bit. Might be preference but I found them a bit harder to get through.

Swan Song - R McCammon: I'm a big fan of post apocalypse and this one kept me hooked for the 900+ pages. It felt a little after-school-special where the stakes don't seem to be there and it makes it feel like The Stand Lite.

Dark Matter - S J Patrick: Great concept and an interesting read, but I felt like the plot meandered a bit. It went a way I wasn't expecting, which isn't bad, just different. Worth a read, but I feel like it started strong and dipped.

The Troop / The Deep / Little Heaven - N Cutter: I enjoyed them all. They were creepy and captivating. Not a fan of animal abuse and all of them have it in some way. The endings missed the mark for me a bit. It feels like Stephen King Lite with similar issues with some of his endings.

Bird Box - J Malerman: One of the few times I feel like the movie got pretty close to the book. Its a concept that works really well visually, but reading it was still eerie.

A Simple Plan - S Smith: Not purely horror but maybe horror adjacent. It was a fast paced thriller with a few twists that kept my attention. Not The Ruins but really not bad.

The Road - C McCarthy: Definitely bleak and hopeless and a harsh reality. The formatting takes getting used to but I thought it was decent overall. A little overrated in my opinion, but your results may vary.

The Radium Girls - K Moore: Tragic story and both shocking and not surprising. Brutally real and a interesting read. Stayed a little past its welcome for me but ultimately kept my attention throughout.



Books I wouldn't recommend:

Amityville Horror - J Anson: The content was unsettling. I wish it was presented better. It felt like an article about the events, which in some cases could be effective, but I feel like it was flat and the opportunities for some creepy scenes were missed.

Hell House - R Matheson: There was some tense, unsettling scenes. But the overall plot lost me a bit and there were definitely some sections that were unnecessarily sexual.



Others:

Aside from Stephen King, I read some Gaiman and Crichton. Of these I'd recommend Coraline, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, Tgw Graveyard Book, and Airframe. Gaiman's stories are beautiful and haunting. Crichton's feel like a movie.

1710272242.0,I finally read Pet Sematary by Stephen King,"i am fairly new to King’s novels; i’ve have read a few short stories, but never got into his novels despite being interested all my life and, for the most part, having an affinity for several of the popular film adaptations.

after I read Gerald’s Game, I was thoroughly creeped out, and then after hearing from multiple people that Pet Sematary was one of the scariest books they ever read, I decided to give it a try. Pet Sematary itself was low on my list because I was pretty ignorant about the plot and thought >!it was just a novel about zombie animals, what’s so scary about that?!<

well wow, I was so wrong. I was fucking scared, lol. for the first time in my life I had dreams about a horror novel while I was reading it. it is so much more than a scary book to me. well, not your typical horrors… >!but about the terrors of grief and how we choose to deal with it.!< I was incredibly scared throughout most of my read but by the time I finished, >!I just felt so, so sad.!< I think this book will stick with me for a while.

1710271678.0,Can we talk about how shit Out There Screaming is?,"I was so hyped for this book. I love Jordan Peele. All three of his horror movies are amazing. I was so excited that he was releasing an anthology  ook of curated horror stories.

So far, the best part of the book has been the introduction that he wrote, because these stories are genuinely awful. The first one is especially bad. It feels like it was written by a horny edgy teenager, trying to write his own Patrick Bateman. The story that comes after that is shit. The twists are so lackluster and the stories are so generic.

This feels like such a cash grab. There's no way that Peele ""selected"" these stories. They just slapped Peele's name of this as an afterthought I think.

It answered the questions I had from the first book about clowns that weren't caught, how the hell people could get away with this, or even be motivated to. And I loved the heel-turn with some of the clowns. (Theater owner and hunters mom)

Dude was it political though. Don't get me wrong I really appreciated the metaphor and it felt more realistic in today's political climate. But even so the weaponized ignorance and ""useful idiots"" rhetoric made it scarier in my opinion. Made it seem like it really could happen.

1710265290.0,The Reddening by Adam Nevill,"So far my exposure to Adam Nevill is the movie version of The Ritual and the Audiobook of The Reddening. I have loved them both and jumped on Amazon to order a bunch of his books when i realised it was the same author.

Im not surprised at the divisive reaction for his writing style (or the unanimous dislike for the audiobook accents!).

One thing that has not really been discussed here is the subtext of motherhood in the Reddening. Kat is supposedly unable to conceive thanks to a bout of chlamydia, and is presented as a bit of an under achiever until her encounter with the Creel cult. By the end she is no longer jealous of Helena and is pregnant.

Helena survives her attempted drowning at sea thanks to her determination to see her daughter again.

Finally it is the Mother figure of the cult who seems to be central to the relationship with the Creel, hinting that she has been granted longer life in return for sacrificing her husbands younger mistresses.

My take was that the ‘Reddening’ had curative properties but also at the expense of unleashing your inner savagery.

1710257526.0,I read 11 books in the past few months and here's a review of them all!,"Sorted lowest to highest:

**Title:** [Cold by Drew Hayden Taylor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125120532)

**Oversimplified plot:** What possible connection could a university professor, hockey player, detective, and plane crash survivor have?

**Sub-genre:** thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** Below them, the sparse forest was deathly silent and still, a condition brought on by weeks of torturous cold that hugged the rough terrain.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** A somewhat exciting start, followed by a very, very boring middle, and capped off with a rushed and predictable ending. The author mentions in the acknowledgements that this story was originally written for a movie and it is blatantly obvious in the writing style.

---

**Title:** [Last to Leave the Room by Caitlin Starling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65213922)

**Oversimplified plot:** Inexplicable geological phenomena + potentially correlated doppelgänger.

**Sub-genre:** sci fi

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** Dr. Tamsin Rivers stands in the abyss.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** This was quiet the frustrating read. The concepts, while not novel, are fascinating and done in a unique way. The main issue I found was the inconsistent pacing. A third of the book had me enthralled, a third of the book was fine, and a third of the book was a slog. And the weirdest part was that each of these thirds were spread out all over the book, so it's not like I can even say ""It started out strong but ended poorly."" The other issue with this book is that it just has soooo many tropes that I personally dislike. For example, the arrogant, cruel, and opportunistic scientist is a trope makes me roll my eyes every time I see it.

---

**Title:** [The Turning by A.L. Masters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59548079)

**Oversimplified plot:** Office mundanities disrupted by global pandemic - zombies.

**Sub-genre:** zombies/apocalyptic

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** The overwhelming stench pervaded the freezing air of the office.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** While the overall plot is interesting the characters are distractingly obnoxious and make really frustrating decisions.

---

**Title:** [I Can See Your Lies by Izzy Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205839109)

**Oversimplified plot:** She can see lies.

**Sub-genre:** Mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** From the author: >!Murder, Violence, Domestic Abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** The scarlet pool expanded over the rug, widening, consuming.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** This novella started off really promising: I loved the pacing, I loved the premise of being able to see lies, the characters felt fairly strong despite knowing them shortly. However, about halfway through, the plot began to lose direction, the namesake concept stopped carrying any weight, and my connection to the characters dwindled. Unfortunately, pretty disappointed overall. (I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.)

---

**Title:** [Metaxysm by R.E. Holding](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202537553)

**Oversimplified plot:** New inventor creates something out of her control.

**Sub-genre:** sci fi

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** Circle Point. A posh, well-known apartment complex for septuagenarian settlers that boasts a peaceful quiet.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** To enjoy this novel you will need a large amount of suspension of disbelief and to come to peace with characters making very stupid decisions. The plot is interesting but quickly goes off the rails and the characters felt like so close to being fully developed but were missing a tiny little push. However, I will say that I really, really enjoyed the author's writing style. There are many passages in here that made me pause and reread it. Overall, I think this author shows a lot of promise and I'm excited about what she writes next. (I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.)

**Title:** [Island Witch by Amanda Jayatissa](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157979441)

**Oversimplified plot:** Daughter of a traditional demon-priest—relentlessly bullied by peers and accused of witchcraft herself—tries to solve the mysterious attacks that have been terrorizing her coastal village.

**Sub-genre:** historical fiction/supernatural

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!child abuse, sexual assault, incest, suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** Blood coursed through him like a rich nectar I wanted to lap up.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This was honestly an exhausting read. The amount of shit the main character goes through is just obscene. The setting is rich and colorful and raw with sprinkles of fantastical elements. It's deceptive because the reality is that this is a super bleak story. If this doesn't get you feeling some type of way then I don't know what will. Depressing, horrible, awful. Just what I love in horror.

---

**Title:** [Holly by Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65916344)

**Oversimplified plot:** What do these octogenarians have to do with so many mysterious disappearances?

**Sub-genre:** mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** It's an old city, and no longer in very good shape, nor is the lake beside which it has been built, but there are parts of it that are still pretty nice.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Octogenarian antagonists?! Hell yes! The conceptualization of the characters were really, really interesting and enjoyable to me. There were some aspects of the plot that I thought were unnecessary (like the focus on a couple side characters), but overall this was a very streamlined book with a surprisingly satisfying ending.

---

**Title:** [Fever House by Keith Rosson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66087060)

**Oversimplified plot:** A severed hand that induces madness is the last thing a leg breaking thug expects to find when collecting overdue money.

**Sub-genre:** Fantasy-ish? Supernatural, maybe?

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!Suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** Tim Reed sits in the driver's seat of his ancient and rust-punched Datsun hatchback, balancing a screwdriver on the tip of his finger.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** This book defies literary conventions in the best way possible, turning potential pitfalls into its most compelling features. The novel's ability to start with a focused plot and then expand into an ever-broadening tapestry is nothing short of masterful. The author skillfully navigates multiple perspectives, including some that are wildly unconventional, to keep us both grounded and on the edge of our seats. What might normally doom another novel—introducing key characters halfway through, flipping throwaway characters into central roles, and alternating between chaotic settings and the mundane backstories of seemingly insignificant characters—becomes the backbone of this story's success. I fucking love this novel. I will reread it. I will dream of it.

#Horror Adjacent Books

**Title:** [Dark Matter by Blake Crouch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27833670)

**Oversimplified plot:** A college professor's life is upended when he's abducted into an alternate reality.

**Sub-genre:** sci fi/thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** I love Thursday nights.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** Get ready for a shock and awe experience. The pace is breakneck with a ton of twists (shock) and the concepts are fascinating (awe). However, if you slow down and sit with it for a bit, you'll start to notice the many flaws. The narrative has some significant plot holes. But more importantly, the characters feel underdeveloped, serving more as plot devices than as fleshed out people. Despite all that, I had fun reading it. And if you wanna turn your brain off and just go for a ride, this is the perfect novel for you.

**Title:** [Six Wakes by Mur Lafferty](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28962996)

**Oversimplified plot:** Clones awake in a space ship to find their previous bodies murdered.

**Sub-genre:** sci-fi/mystery/thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** Sound struggled to make its way through the thick synth-amneofluid. Once it reached Maria Arena's ears, it sounded like a chain saw: loud, insistent, and unending.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This is a solid sci-fi mystery with an interesting concept and a well-executed plot. I found this novel to be entertaining and really enjoyed the pacing. There is a natural ebb and flow of tension that neither leaves you exhausted nor bored and weaves in each characters past with the horrors and challenges they are currently facing. I also appreciate that this isn't just a murder mystery with a sci-fi set dressing; the science fiction is enmeshed in and pivotal to the plot.

**Title:** [Confessions by Kanae Minato](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19161835)

**Oversimplified plot:** Teacher seeks revenge on the students that killed her daughter.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller/mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!suicidal ideation, child abuse, child death!<

**Opening Lines:** Once you finish your milk, please put the carton back in the box.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** I've said it before and I'll say it again, I love revenge stories! This one just blew me out of the water. First of all, one of the best POV switching out there. Masterfully done, no notes. Secondly, you know this story is going to be good when each chapter your eyes slowly get wider and wider and it ends with your jaw being on the floor. Each chapter!! And finally, how is it possible that I thought the first chapter told the perfect revenge story and yet there were 5 more to go?! I love this book.

I did enjoy it but was taking too long to get into it so I figured I'd finish it at a later day but now I can't remember what its called lol.
From what I remember, it was about a Dr. who is called to care for a maid in a, now decaying, old manor. His mother worked at this same manor as a maid in it's hay day. It's now being taken care of by the remaining brother and sister.  I think the siblings invited some neighbors over and their young daughter was bitten in the face by their dog.

1710191985.0,The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires is a must-read for vampire lovers everywhere,"“The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires” by Grady Hendrix is a hell of a ride. I’ve read Hendrix before and also enjoyed “The Final Girl Support Group” very much as his writing style, character development, plot twists, and all the creepy/scary situations are done very well.  
  
For this novel, if you love vampires and want a scary, vulgar, modern story that gives you major “‘Salem’s Lot” vibes, this checks all those boxes and then some. Everything from the main protagonist, Patricia, to the eventual villain you’ll encounter, made for an extremely memorable read. I enjoy reading vampire novels and this is right up there with one of the more unique ways to tell a compelling story that hooks you right from the start to a wild ending.  
  
Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but this is one of those hard-to-put-down horror novels. Some scenes and situations make you cringe, look away, re-read, and wince. The way Hendrix fleshes these certain situations out is so horrific that you’ll be on the edge of your seat leading to a beyond-satisfying conclusion. The buildup and momentum going into the ending were fantastic!  
  
I give “The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires” a perfect 5/5 as I’d consider it a must-read for anyone who loves vampires, gore, blood, and just what a Southern ladies' book club would do if this ever happened in real life. That’s what I loved the most about it as it all felt believable which added to the overall immersion of a high-quality horror novel. I plan to recommend those to anyone who also loves this genre.",horrorlit

I'll admit in the beginning I didn't think I was going to like it. The main character and his friends seemed too cookie cutter at first, and their banter honestly made me think they were not that smart. However, even though I knew the book was going to be dark, it kept getting darker and darker with each page, and I the twists were not what I expected them to be. This novel kind of felt like The Wickerman meets Midsommar because everything looked so fairy tale on the surface, but when years of torture and hurt turned into years of revenge and more violence madness ensued and no one was left feeling redeemed, whole or complete.

1710106743.0,"“Mexican Gothic” thoughts, without spoilers","Just finished reading Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia, first published in 2020. I picked it up after finding it on some random “best horrors list”, and because of my general interest in Mexican culture.

For the “Mexican” aspect, I must say I’m disappointed at least. Judging from the title and authors heritage I was hoping for at least some Aztec, Mayan or other pre-Colombian belief woven into the story. The main character, a very young woman from Mexico City travels to a remote village to check on her cousin, who married a heir to an old, formerly wealthy family, coming from England.

The whole setting draws (at least for me) from Poe-esque gothic novel, not adding a lot on top of it. The Mexican part of the novel ends with the entrance to the Victorian house of Doyle. All the dialogue is explicitly in English, ripping the placement from any area on Earth.

I’m not sure where the scares were supposed to come from. The dream sequences try to push the mystery forward, they don’t add anything to the atmosphere though. Some occasional gore feels weirdly out of place, neither adding to the horror nor being disgusting enough to be memorable.

I’m not “canceling” the author. I am really curious about her anthology Daughters of Cthulhu, hopefully they can deliver without promising too much.

1710098395.0,A Review of “From Below” by Darcy Coates - The Power of Environment in Horror Genre (without spoilers),"Firstly, I want to point out that horror is a genre I read only rarely but after reading through several fantasy series, I was desperate for a change in genre. As a result, I am certainly not the best judge of the quality of a horror themed novel. Nevertheless, the book left me wanting to write a review so let's hope it's worth a penny.

The book opens up with **a team of divers and filmmakers preparing to explore the insides of a long lost ship SS Arcadia**. The tensions between the team members are subtle yet tangible and so are their doubts and fears which provides a nice basis before the diving even begins. Each of the characters has nuances and secret goals. They form an intriguing group of characters while also having distinct personalities. Throughout the book, it is easy to grow fond of the whole team and by the end, it is difficult to not wish for all of them to survive despite their shortcomings and disputes.

The novel switches back and forth between the main story and the accounts of the last days of SS Arcadia before its downfall which creates a nice pacing and builds up suspense on two fronts while also offering a room to breathe.

What makes this book a truly thrilling read, however, is **the frightening power of the dark underwater environment.** Swimming through the deep dark waters with little lighting, with the ever-present consciousness of having a limited supply of air, being surrounded by the tight spaces of a surprisingly well preserved shipwreck and hearing sounds which the wreck should not be emitting. Seeing things which are impossible to explain, hoping that it is only your mind playing tricks on you. Darcy Coates takes advantage of these environmental aspects to the fullest and intertwines it brilliantly with the **mental struggles** that sprout alongside it. I felt fear crawl down my spine just reading about the unforgiving nature of this dark domain.

**The supernatural elements** are slowly but surely creeping into the story and eventually **join forces with the environmental horrors** which never truly disappear. Combined together, these elements create a truly engaging read.

If I had to slightly criticize the novel for something then it would be its length. The team undergoes a few separate dives and I did feel like one dive less would have been perfect for the length as the “break” between the last two dives did lower the tension and feeling of urgency a bit.

To conclude, I enjoyed *From Below* so much that I even pushed myself into writing a review and that says something. Till the very end the book keeps you on the edge wondering whether someone's existence will have to end so that everyone else's can be preserved. I cannot recommend this novel enough and have to praise the use of environmental horror especially (but it wouldn’t be enough without an enjoyable set of characters).

I would appreciate some recommendations for horror novels where the environment plays a big part. I can imagine that environments such as dark forests, deep caves, frozen mountaintops or barren wasteland could also provide a great foundation for a horror story. Recommendations for other novels from Darcy Coates certainly also wouldn't hurt!",horrorlit
1710097316.0,"I love horror that features body horror, gore, gross stuff, etc but without the SA, DV, or general degradation of women. Any recs?","I love body horror.

1710088739.0,Damnation Game,"Ill preface this by admitting that Clive Barker has played a large influence on my life. He was my first horror author, first inklings of realizations of my sexuallity so please take this review with these in mind. Im a person and able to be bias.

I really enjoyed this book by the ending, throughout the pages the characters had depth and motivations. Their flaws and goals seemed to class and build off on another in interesting dynamics. Specific characters came off chilling or grotesque as the scene needed it. Powerful and pitiful. There were though two characters who showed up near the end who I felt didnt add much to the plot besides their exploitation. 

There were scenes that linger on the edge of my thoughts at certain sights, like when i see my dog bite her leg I get flashes of grotesque imagery. There were scenes that managed to give a lingering sence of dread where I didnt want to see what I thought would happen next but I kept reading.

The start is slow, there is no denying this as it seems to be to common issue described by other readers. However, I enjoyed the slow burn of the candle. I also felt that it didnt fall into the trap of explaining too much letting the fear of the unknow linger and the readers imagination attempt to fill in the gaps.

While Sacrament still remains my faviorte of his work and Mister B Gone the most nestalgic for me I would still reccomend this book if youre willing to enjoy a slow start ",horrorlit

1710044495.0,Finished Episode Thirteen,"I just finished the audiobook for Episode Thirteen by Craig DiLouie. I thought it was fantastic overall, with a really strong middle and a satisfactory ending (that didn’t grip me quite as much as some of the earlier scenes). I had to turn off the audiobook several times because I am a wuss and the song that would play when things acted up freaked me out so badly. I was at my desk in the middle of the day having to take deep breaths to get through one scene (without spoiling anything for people who haven’t read it, the scene where they capture it on camera for the first time). 

I thought the characters were well written, although I did have trouble distinguishing a couple of the male characters. Jessica was my favorite, I felt really connected to her and why she was working with the group. Claire also felt fleshed-out, especially when she was making decisions I disagreed with as a reader who wanted everyone to run to safety. 

About the audiobook production: I listen to a lot of audiobooks at work, and this might be my top listening experience so far. Most of the books I listen to don’t have a full cast, so that was already exciting. The sound effects were so well done, it was kind of terrifying. 

I’m re-reading what I wrote next and it might be veering into spoiler territory by comparing it to a different book, so warning if you are planning to read and want the surprise. 

I found the ending to be pretty solid, but I saw some reviewers who felt it wasn’t quite as fresh for those who’ve read House of Leaves. I haven’t read House of Leaves but kind of know some general elements. Based on the little I know, I could see how the setting near the end might be similar. For me, the ending segment felt like a fitting and very scary ending for the characters, but I could see how it might have been underwhelming for others. The middle portions were just outstanding once the action picked up, so it was tough to top that. 

I’ll definitely look into Craig DiLouie’s other books to see if there’s anything else that might be a good fit for me. 

As a side note, my other favorite horror book is A Head Full of Ghosts. I think I really loved the reality show element of both books. If anyone has any recommendations for more horror with a reality show element, I’d love to hear them! I watched Ghost Adventures religiously as a kid, so I think on some level stories with the reality show component feel more “real” to me, and make me more terrified from the jump. 

Super glad I found a great audiobook experience/story combo. If I ever hear the song from the book in real life, I’m going to run first and ask questions later. ",horrorlit

1710030772.0,Between Two Fires by Chris Buehlman was incredible,"I made a post about this book a few days ago through the first 12ish chapters and it gained decent traction, so I figured I'd give my thoughts now that I'm totally finished. I feel like I can give a different perspective because I would never consider myself a fan of horror in any medium, and this book would be great for someone trying to get into horror literature. 

Buehlman's writing is slightly advanced. Keeping up with 14th century vernacular can be difficult, but he made it as easy as possible to navigate. He spent the perfect amount of time detailing a characters image and the setting. I can't stand when someone goes on and on with every minute detail, and Buehlman gave to exactly what you needed without rambling. 

The characters aren't the most unique in terms of archetypes, but they're executed so well. Thomas is your typical anti-hero who ends up on this journey begrudgingly after saving Delphine from his own crew. He's honestly the only character from the main trio with any major progression in my opinion, and he is my favorite from the book. His humor and the playful, yet brutal, back and forths he has with others (Delphine in particular) are hilarious. He is a shining example of what makes this book so great - the perfectly timed humor throughout this horrific tale. Delphine can be annoying at times, but I feel like this was intentional. I'm a grown man, so I'm looking at the events through a grown man's eyes, and it would be extremely frustrating to deal with a young girl crying over a flute when literal Hell has been brought to Earth. However, her ability to remain a child throughout the story kept everything pleasantly grounded. I also love how she was more so a vessel rather than a ""chosen one"" character type. The Priest, Matthieu, was the glue to the group. The one who kept Thomas from offing Delphine when he was being headstrong, but also making sure Delphine understood the gravity of the situation when she was being emotional. He's the most stereotypical character to me, the heavily flawed priest, but I didn't mind it. The way this group came together, and the way both Matthieu and Thomas protected Delphine, was so humbling. They made me laugh and cry numerous times throughout. This book is a decent length, not incredibly long, but I felt like I knew them throughout a 10 book series. The side characters were also great. Most of them are very short lived, but Buehlman maximized their ""screen time."" Jehan and Annette, and the big man on the raft leave a huge impact on the whole story despite lasting maybe 2 chapters each.

The horror in this was unsettling. Like I said in my first post, I didn't think a book could ever scare me, but this scared the shit out of me. What I loved was the mental horror was just as bad as the physical horror. My only complaint about the entire book, which is very nitpicky, is the scariest part was fairly early with the Paris arc. Other parts were still great and also scary, but I lost sleep over Paris and it stuck with me for days (honestly still with me).

1710027303.0,Love finding books I almost bought at Barnes and Noble at hole in the wall bookstores for $2-$7,"I found a few horror books, Adam Neville books  and a few other books that caught my eye, but thought better of it. And just bought an expensive ass bookmark 🙄 

Walked into a small ass bookstore and found 3 out of 4 books i almost bought 

Would’ve spent $60-$70 but ended up spending $26 (bought 7 extra books lol) 

I’m am 

Content 😂 


But also 

What are some of your recommendations?? 

I love horror that has a twist, that makes me say out loud “ok…what the HELL???” And makes me feel queezy but excited to stay up until 3 am. 

But I don’t enjoy shock horror just to shock you, like child SA, incest, body horror for the reason of “just cuz”. 

Books that kind of are like Hereditary. Give me PASSION make me FEEL lol",horrorlit
1710026784.0,Thoughts on The Big Meat by Carlton Mellick III,"I was kind of disappointed. I think it's partly my fault as I had massively hyped myself up to the idea of it. I think it's main problem was that it could have used another 100 or 150 pages to really explore all the grimy facets of this world in which a gargantuan monster is rotting in the ruins of downtown Portland.

1710021815.0,The House Across the Lake made me never want to read Riley Sager ever again,"“The House Across the Lake” by Riley Sager starts pretty interesting but as you keep reading, it starts to drag on. I felt several chapters going back and forth between “Before” and “Now” were repetitive. It took way too long for a real plot twist to happen as this was a slog to get through between the 20% - 70% mark of this novel.  
  
I felt that many situations involving the main protagonist’s drinking adventures, Casey, could have been truncated to make this novel tighter and a better read. A lot of these situations kept repeating themselves and honestly felt like fluff to me. This novel could have easily been about 100 pages shorter and it would have been a better reading experience. It starts creepy, fizzles out tremendously for a huge chunk of the novel, and by the time things get creepy again, it happens a lot later than it should have.  
  
When it comes to the dialogue and conversations between characters, I also noticed that a lot of things continued to be repeated to the point where I started to get frustrated because it’s a recurring theme. I’m all about a great story and the development of characters, but why explain a situation and then have that same situation repeated all over again in dialogue? I kept saying to just get to the point already and again, stop dragging things on.  
  
Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but towards the end when things finally get interesting, it does get boring because again, Sager keeps fleshing the obvious out to the point of no control. I wish things were edited down a bit and made sure that every word counted, not elaborate on every little thing three or four times over just to add more pages for the sake of adding more pages.  
  
When it came to the ending, I also felt it was unrealistic considering what went down with the lake and what eventually gets revealed. It’s like reading two different stories when it would have been better to simply stick to the creepiness of the lake and run with that, not trying to jam in something else that didn’t need to be added in. It just felt very unbelievable and took me out of the reading experience entirely, which I’ve dealt with in the past with Sager in “Survive the Night” with unrealistic situations and endings that would never, ever happen in the real world.  
  
Overall, I give “The House Across the Lake” by Riley Sager a 2/5 as I did enjoy the plot twists but they came way too late. I wish more was explained about Lake Greene to wrap things up and not have all this fluff that just made for a mostly boring reading experience. I should have learned from “Survive the Night” but make no mistake about it, I am done with reading anything Sager writes from here on out.",horrorlit

1710014912.0,Please help me find a book based off previous horrors I’ve liked and disliked. ,"The Only Good Indians - loved this book. The basketball scene was a bit much but emotionally by the end I was wrecked. 

Head Full of Ghosts - did not like at all. 

The Fisherman - I loved the atmosphere of this book but I don’t think I like science fiction horror at all. As soon as there was some monster fish or whatever I mentally checked out. 

House of Leaves - I haven’t technically finished this but I’m so far loving it. I lost the physical book and am still trying to find it. 


I love any horror movies that are set in a foggy outside atmosphere. I loved Haunting of Hill House (the tv show), I loved Midsommar and Hereditary. Despite never being able to watch it again (out of sheer horror lol), The Ring’s atmosphere is exactly what I am drawn to. 

I also LOVED the movie “I’m Thinking of Ending Things.” I love liminal space movies, or movies where something is off. I loved the Shining. If you watched season 1 of The Sinner, I would like to find something like that. It’s not technically a horror but there are a lot of unsettling bits. ",horrorlit

Several chapters are quite tedious, though, with all of Patrick's explicit details of what people are wearing, the things in every apartment or office and his music reviews, but I guess that's the point to emphasize Patrick's shallowness and materialism. Other than that, it's a pretty hilarious story with lots of absurd shit. As for the horror and violence scenes... Wow. That's all I can say. Wow. The murders are fucking brutal and unpleasant.

“Kyle had accepted Amber’s story at face value, and so easily she had even questioned his readiness to believe her.” No One Gets Out Alive Page 523

1710010455.0,My Stephen king rant. ,"Having a bit of trouble with my man SK lately. I’m new to reading and to SK I’ve heard from almost ever source available he’s the goat of the genre. Iv read now salems lot and the shining after which I really enjoyed. I gave salems lot a 3/5 stars on good reads and the shining a 4/5. I think I’m in the minority when i say his books are incredibly hard to pickup until the last 3rd of his books. I also read the exorcist and was blown away how good the pacing was comparatively. I’m a little disappointed I bought so much SK thinking salems lot was an outlier and more of his books would keep a better pace but they are just so slow. If you can get to the last 3rd they are very good. I tried pet semetary and decided to stop and take a massive break from the style. I’m now reading the girl next door and the pacing is so good. It’s such an easy read pacing wise.  The thought of giving SK the time to flesh out a book like the stand horrifies me how slow that book has the potential of being. And maybe no one else sees it as slow but just world building and character development which is true. But if we look at the shining I couldn’t stand reading about the history of the hotel. You could have quickly summed it up but instead we spent so much time following the entire history. I’m sure this rant is all over the place I’m at work and typing quickly. What’s your thoughts on this y’all? Am I crazy? 


EDIT: I’ve decided the books are  still worth consuming so when I workout/clean I’ll consume his stories via audio books as a compromise idk why I didn’t think about this before LOL",horrorlit

And while I wasn't a big fan of the direction he took for The Creeper, I gotta say, I would read it again just for the style of his writing. The author is incredibly talented. Reminded me of listening to a hip-hop album of a great lyricist where I would here a great bar, have to rewind, and listen again. As for The Watchers, I genuinely loved it. It's not particularly scary. And maybe doesn't have the same flair as The Creeper. Although that's debatable. I loved the story and really cared for the characters.

I guess I was never on the edge of my seat wondering what's going to happen next; everything felt largely predictable and I had the ""twist"" figured out way too early. I was just kinda waiting for it to end, yet it's on all of these best of lists. Anybody else?

1709985694.0,The Troop,"Just finished The Troop (Nick Cutter) as it kept popping up on people’s lists of the most horrifying horror that they’ve read. I enjoyed the book a lot, I thought it was a classic monster horror story with a lot of body horror and gore thrown in. However, it didn’t really repulse or horrify me. Some scenes were definitely unsettling and gave me the creeps, like going into the dark cave with the monster, descriptions of the chimp who was experimented on, and the overall horror of human experimentation is always uncomfortable to say the least. Overall I thought it was an enjoyable horror story but not outstanding in any way. 

Cows, which also always pops up on such lists, I found disgusting in a put-me-off-my-food way and I had to put it down every now and then to take a deep breath. I was expecting more of these reactions from reading The Troop.

1709963565.0,Dean Koontz Explained,"If you are like me and have been to a used book store, you have likely seen Dean Koontz paperbacks scattered everywhere. They range in condition from band new to utterly destroyed. And often you see them on the clearance shelf. You have likely thought how can a guy have so many books published but so many of them rotting on a used book store clearance shelf. I don't claim to be an expert but here is my answer.

I have read 1 novel and 1 short story of Mr. Koontz because I was curious to uncover this mystery. Some may say this isn't enough to get a through perspective but I feel it is for this author in particular and to be honest I really did not want to read anymore of is writing.

The good:
- has great overall ideas for his stories
-his ideas for horror are excellent and I've seen great potential in the stories and a uniqueness that if done correctly can be truly horrifying
- some of the writing is excellent. I love the way he describes some things and has a unique way with great vocabulary to set a scene.

The bad:
- he is so heavy handed in everything he is trying to to say in the stories. It is almost as if he believes the readers will not be able to dicern an idea unless it is explicitly laid out for them
- the dialogue is brutal. Sometimes it's ok but sometimes you wonder if you could really picture someone saying those things. It doesn't sound like like how anyone I know would talk
-heavy handedness with Religious themes. Mr Koontz converted to Catholicism and it is very apparent in the short story I read. I am Catholic as well but he really really beats you over the head with the themes of Christianity to the point of nausication. I think stories can do great with Religious allegories but not written like this. It hurts.

Overall I would say if you like horror read one of his books (I'd probably want to research in advance like I did) to understand the author but I would not recommend reading more than that. Hopefully this explains a little more about the author. Like I said I claim to be no expert so if you have any input or think I missed the mark on anything please let me know. I'd love to hear other's thoughts!",horrorlit

1709933163.0,HELP NEEDED: Looking for the title of this horror book (collection of short stories)!,"Hi all!

When I was little (some 20 years ago) I had a book that absolutely terrified me (and probably would to this day). It was a small collection of short horror stories, of which I remember some. The book included some of the most horrifying illustrations I've ever seen. Sadly I no longer have the book, but I'm dying to find it again to read once more. The short stories felt old (like written around the era of Charles Dickens) and the settings were in old England if I recall correctly. 

The short stories I remember include:

\- A man entering a library to find an ancient old man sitting in a chair in the corner, which creeps him out. One day the man approaches the old man to find out that the wrinkled old man has no eyes. (included black and white drawing of wrinkled old man with huge empty eye sockets)

\- A man looking out of the window of the inn he's staying at to see that outside the window of a room in the floor below him, a strange skeletal thin man-like entity is beckoning to the occupants of the room inside. (accompanying illustration of a horrible demonic skeletal figure beckoning to someone inside a room from outside the window) Eventually the occupants are reported missing, and their corpse is found entertwined with a strange skeletal corpse in the bottom of a nearby well (or something like that)

\- A story of an evil stumpy tree that spews out demonic spiders

\- A short story of an uncle who welcomes his newly orphaned niece and nephew into his home, only for his niece and nephew to see horrible ghosts of children with their hearts cut out in various parts of the home. They eventually uncover the corpses of these heart-less children underneath the floorboards, and discover their uncle is going to ritually sacrifice them to the devil (or something) to obtain immortality by cutting out their hearts, and he has been collecting children's hearts for a while.

Half Way Check In
I really really like the main character Colquitt Kennedy. She’s talkative and vivacious and I care about her. She makes good cocktails and she’s a great hostess. I told my s.o. I want to live in a neighborhood like Walter and Colquitt do. Full of life, friendship, comfortability and cocktails. It seems like a slower pace of life but I really would like to live that way. 
All the characters I didn’t care for too much have been killed off at a lovely pace, the story hasn’t been slow or boring at all even half way through. I’ve had to look up so many words that I didn’t know from this book. In a good way. I love novels like this.

Wow. What a great book. I found this book through a tik tok recommendation, and randomly it didn’t disappoint. I found the main characters Walter and Colquitt Kennedy to be extremely relatable. This book being set in the 80’s didn’t affect its readability or relatability for me at all. Even though I am neither southern or rich, lol. This book makes me want to write a book. 

The ending was a little mysterious, with Kim Dougherty coming back to get married and purchase the haunted house. I don’t know why they had to kill him and the cats to burn the house down. Though I do think I would burn it down as well. I did love that the author described their slow descent into incredulity to their neighborhood friends. It was exactly how I would have gone about telling the world about a haunted house. I want to know more about Kim’s adoption and why he was made to build the house. I want to know what starts the fire that kills the house, colquitt, Walter and the rest. In retrospect? This book wasn’t blood and guts scary, but one that road the line between anxiety and societal fears. The ending made me think. It really did affect me. Could Colquitt and Walter be having a share delusion? But what about Kim pretty much being destined to build the home? Such a great read.

WHY COULDNT THEY JUST REHOME THE CATS MAN??

1709849317.0,Between Two Fires Question: Monkey Brains/Feast Scene,"Hi!

I am listening to Between Two Fires as an audiobook and I have hit a point in the book that has me in a psychic-stun lock, hoping someone can help me understand the passage with Father Matthieu speaking Latin at the feast.  During the strange feast with the Monkey Brains - the Count/Lord is antagonizing Father Mathieu about how to say ""These are my brains"" in Latin. 

&#x200B;

When Father Matthieu is translating the phrase to Latin he says, something about it ""sounding uncomfortably close to..."", since I don't have the text in front of me, I'm not quite sure what this could mean. Is it just that it sounds close to the phrases ""this is my body and blood"" during communion or is it specific to the Latin?   Any help here would be appreciated or this will be stuck in my brain for days - google searches have been unhelpful.

&#x200B;

Thanks!",horrorlit
1709847228.0,"Have any of you read Maldoror by Lautreamont? Can we talk about this obscure, extreme horror writer before horror was even a thing?","First of all, if you haven't heard of this author, [HERE](https://litkicks.com/lautreamont/) is a really fascinating piece about him that I think would interest anyone interested in the pre-history of horror. I'm kind of banking on nobody having written about Lautreamont on this sub before, but I'm probably wrong.

This guy was insane and Maldoror is essentially a fever dream of horrors. There is even a scene where the main character has seggs with a shark?

1709833270.0,I wish The Woman in Black had a different ending *spoilers*,"Sorry if you’re all tired of posts about The Woman in Black by now, but here goes…

I really enjoyed the book, it was a fun and creepy read, and though I wasn’t amazed by the way it was written I found the atmosphere it depicted to be incredible, haunting and somewhat unique. However, I would really wish a different ending for it.

It seems to break with the logic of the book that Arthur’s sightings of the Woman in Black the first time around doesn’t cause any child death, as the curse would normally go, but that the woman would rather show up AGAIN more than a year later, far away from Eel Marsh, to take away his son. This seems out of character from what we’ve learned previously, and also makes it seem that she has a specific vendetta for Arthur. I get that he was insistent and prying, but I get the sense from the things we learn in the book (from Jerome, for instance), that he is not the first to be too brave and curious for his own good. I think this takes away from some of the eeriness of the tale. Not to mention that this turn of events throws off the dates we’ve learned previously – in the first chapter of the book, we learn that Arthur was twelve years a widower by the age of 35. We also learn that he is 23 when he first travels to Eel Marsh (unless “barely 23 years old” can be taken to mean that he is 22? Sorry, English is not my first language). I loved the suspense of knowing by the very start of the story that Arthur’s wife would pass away within the year, and wondering how it would come about seeming as she was so far away from where the events take place. Having her finally show up in the village, only for them to leave, with nothing happening for more than a years time, made the story seem less tight-knit to me. The Woman in Black showing up in London then felt like a random insert.

I think it would have been cool if Stella showed up in the village to take Arthur home, and tell him she was pregnant. This could send Arthur into a disarray that would tarnish his last time spent with Stella, until she passed away in childbirth or similar within the year. It would feel more in keeping with what we had learned thus far, and give a sense that Stella’s coming to the village allowed the Woman in Black to grab on to her and mark her with the curse. 

I would also love to know if Arthur ever got that dog haha.",horrorlit
1709832540.0,A Few Under the Radar Recommendations,"I love getting book recommendations from this sub and seeing what other people are reading, so I thought I’d share a few things I read recently that I don’t see mentioned very often.  
***Knock Knock, Open Wide*** **by Neil Sharpson.** I loved this novel. It was funny, scary, and also romantic at times. KKOW follows a young queer couple, Betty and Ashling, as they meet in college and form a relationship. Ashling has a deeply troubled family history that is intertwined with a mysterious children’s TV show. The show features a puppet of a black goat that lives in a box and only comes out if children are naughty. Weirdly, Ash seems to be the only person who remembers the episode where the goat appears. Sharpson is Irish, and KKOW is deeply informed about Irish history and folklore. If you’re looking for a novel that delves into some slightly different scares and explores another culture’s myths, this is one to read.   
***The Militia House*** **by John Milas.** The novel follows a young marine deployed to Afghanistan around 2010. When you hear military horror, you might imagine a book about combat, but there’s no real battles in TMH. Instead, it is a book about the slow, grinding horror of the narrator’s experience. Things start to go awry for him when he and few others sneak out of the safe zone to enter an abandoned building (the titular militia house) where Soviet-era soldiers were supposedly skinned alive. A few reviews have compared it to *House of Leaves* and I can see that thematically, if not in narrative style. I really enjoyed it because I love a good unsettling slow burn and I am always on the hunt for horror in interesting locales.   
***An Ordinary Violence*** **by Adriana Chartrand.** I keep waiting to see this book on lists of Indigenous horror and it never comes up! A rec for anyone else who loves that genre—read this book. It’s an unsettling and unrelentingly bleak story that follows Dawn, a young Canadian woman who returns to her hometown when her troubled brother is released from prison. It’s cosmic horror but intensely focused on the familial relationships. The vibes are immaculate— the closest thing to it that I’ve read is Gus Moreno’s *This Thing Between Us.*   
Would love to know if anyone has read these and what you thought! If you have recs for similar stuff that isn’t mentioned as often on here, I am all ears. Happy reading!",horrorlit
1709830122.0,Help finding a short story,"I'm looking for a short story I remember reading in my very early teens, so early 90s, though I think it may have been written in the 80s. I believe it was in a collection of short stories all by the same author.

1709819583.0,"I've been translating the 800s AD Chinese story that Lafcadio Hearn's ""Akinosuke's Dream"" was based on","I'm a big fan of Kwaidan, and as a professional translator, Hearn's work has really inspired me to dig into the treasure trove of old / ancient Chinese ghost stories that appear in the record from around 500 BC to 1600 AD.

In Kwaidan, Hearn says that ""Akinosuke's Dream"" was based on an old Chinese story, and I'm happy to say I was able to find the original with little trouble.

The original Chinese version is actually quite long. It's a multi-chapter novella known as a Tang Legend, from the Tang era of Chinese history (roughly 600 - 800 AD). This is also around the time that Japan was going full Sinophile and importing everything from Chinese culture it could get its hands on.

**Here's a fraction of the translated text.** I'll add a link to the article version (my website / blog) for those who are interested in reading on (though I've only completed parts 1 and 2 out of what will probably be 6 or 7).

Would love to know what you folks think.

[Article Version Here](https://ericrstone.com/2022/02/24/akinosukes-dream-chinese/)

There once lived a man named Fen Chunyu from Dongping County — a character of chivalrous exploits of the Southeast lands of Wu-Chu. He was fond of liquor, ill-tempered, and unrestrained in manner, and his family had amassed a large fortune, with which they housed a number of bold retainers.  
東平淳于棼，吳楚遊俠之士，嗜酒使氣，不守細行，累巨產，養豪客。  
Due to his martial talents, Fen had previously served as a deputy general for the Huainan military. However, after defying his general in a drunken outburst, Fen was stripped of his rank and left with nothing, and from then on wasted his days away drinking.  
曾以武藝補淮南軍裨將，因使酒忤帥，斥逐落魄，縱誕飲酒為事。  
Fen lived about 4 – 5 kilometers east of Guangling Commandery. At the southern end of his residence, there was a large pagoda tree with a dense canopy of long branches, the shade of which extended several meters. And it was under this shade that Mr. Chunyu spent his days drinking with his bold companions.  
家住廣陵郡東十里，所居宅南有大古槐一株，枝幹修密，清陰數畝，淳於生日與群豪大飲其下。  
One day, in the Ninth Month of the 7th year of Tangzhen (791 AD), Fen fell ill from his drinking, and two of his friends propped him up from his seat and walked him back to the house, where they laid him down in the eastern wing of the main hall.  
唐貞元七年九月，因沈醉致疾，時二友人於坐，扶生歸家，臥於堂東廡之下。  
They said to him: “You should rest. We’ll feed the horses and wash our feet, and leave later once you’re feeling better.”  
二友謂生曰：「子其寢矣，余將秣馬濯足，俟子小愈而去。」  
Fen unraveled his head wrappings and lay down to sleep in a daze, as if dreaming.  
生解巾就枕，昏然忽忽，彷彿若夢。  
Suddenly, he saw two emissaries in purple, and they prostrated themselves before him and said: “The Emperor of Huai’an has sent us humble servants to deliver an invitation.”  
見二紫衣使者，跪拜生曰：「槐安國王遣小臣致命奉邀。」  
Without knowing what he was doing, Fen got out of bed, tidied his clothes, and followed the emissaries to the door. There, he saw a small catalpa-wood carriage pulled by four livestock, with 7 – 8 attendants on either side. They helped Fen onto the carriage, and it exited through the gate, toward a cavern under the pagoda tree, into which the emissaries promptly drove them. And though Fen thought this peculiar, he didn’t dare ask questions.  
生不覺下榻整衣，隨二使至門。見青油小車，駕以四牡，左右從者七八，扶生上車，出大戶，指古槐穴而去，使者即驅入穴中。生意頗甚異之，不敢致問。  
In a flash, Fen saw mountains, streams, roads, and greenery, in a landscape most unlike that of the world of men. And after traveling several kilometers, they came to a city wall with parapets, where the road was an endless sea of people and carriages.   
忽見山川風候，草木道路，與人世甚殊。前行數十里，有郛郭城堞，車輿人物，不絕於路。  
Attendants barked orders sternly from Fen’s left and right, and the pedestrians raced to part to the roadside. And as they entered the city’s walls, there stood a crimson door and a storied tower with the words “The Great Nation of Huai’an” written in gold upon it.  
生左右傳車者傳呼甚嚴，行者亦爭辟於左右。又入大城，朱門重樓，樓上有金書，題曰「大槐安國」。  
The door guards rushed forward to prostrate themselves before immediately withdrawing, and a rider on horseback announced: “As his royal son-in-law has traveled far, the Emperor has arranged for you to take lodging in the Donghua Building.”  
執門者趨拜奔走，旋有一騎傳呼曰：「王以駙馬遠降，令且息東華館。」  
The rider turned to lead the way; and, in the next moment, a door opened, and Fen descended the carriage to enter.  
因前導而去。俄見一門洞開，生降車而入。  
The Donghua Building was a spectacle of intricately carved and colorfully painted columns and banisters. Gorgeous trees bearing rare and precious fruits were planted in rows outside of the main hall, while cushions, tables, refreshments, and drapery were arranged within. And Fen was inwardly most pleased!  
彩檻雕楹，華木珍果，列植於庭下；几案茵褥，簾幃餚膳，陳設於庭上。生心甚自悅。  
A voice announced: “The west-minister has arrived.”   
復有呼曰：「右相且至。」  
And Fen descended the steps to pay courtesy, as a man in purple with an ivory flat-scepter rushed forward. Host and guest exchanged formalities, and the west-minister said: “My emperor has invited Sir here — not on the premise that my humble nation is distant and secluded — to make ties to you through marriage.”  
生降階祗奉。有一人紫衣象簡前趨，賓主之儀敬盡焉。右相曰：「寡君不以弊國遠僻，奉迎君子，托以姻親。」  
Fen replied: “I am but a wretched body; I dare not hope for such.”  
生曰：「某以賤劣之軀，豈敢是望。」  
And thus, the west-minister led Fen away.  
右相因請生同詣其所。  
After about 100 paces, they entered a crimson door, on the other side of which spears, halberds, hatchets, and battle-axes were on display to the left and right, and hundreds of imperial military officials parted to make way. Among them, Fen saw his life-long drinking buddy Bian Zhou, and he felt joy in his heart, though he didn’t dare to approach him for inquiry.  
行可百步，入朱門，矛戟斧鉞，布列左右，軍吏數百，辟易道側。生有平生酒徒周弁者，亦趨其中，生私心悅之，不敢前問。  
The west-minister led Fen up to a spacious palace, and there the guards were especially grim — this apparently His most reverent abode. Fen saw a magnificent figure in the room’s center, wearing pure-white silk robes and a crimson decorated crown, and he began to tremble, not daring to look up, as attendants on either side of him made him prostrate...

1709789424.0,This Thing Between Us,"Wow… i have such a love/hate relationship with this book. This might be a hot take, but i found the first half (and i mean that so literally, like split HOTTT down the middle) was donkey cheeks. Honestly it was so mind-numbingly slow that it took me an entire month to get to the halfway point, and this is a very short read. BUT i kept hearing great things about it, so i powered through, and my god was it worth it. Sure, the first half had its ominous moments of a potentially haunted Alexa-equivalent smart speaker, and the exploration of Thiago’s grief felt quite real, like the loneliness and regret creeped up on him slowly, but rarely did it keep me flipping the pages. The second half started picking up and i found myself picking it up and flipping pages more and more often. The whole plot line of Thiago and Brimley was a nice positive addition to an otherwise depressing story until *that part* happened. From then on, i was hooked. Everything got so incredibly creepy and sinister, sometimes even humorously ironic like in the part where the vet swiped the salt from the doorway. I loved how much of a lurking threat the wall felt like and how uneasy the beach and cook seemed during that dream-like sequence. Let’s see if the end holds up.

My Nope List - Books I’ve read but can’t recommend, but others might like since they cosmic horror:

•Nightside Series  by Simon Green - ‘ and it was the easiest thing in the world ‘ to put this series down - repetitive writing, lame troupes, the ‘damage girl’ sub plot.   

•The Man with the Golden Torc - I think I’m just not a Simon Green fan, good world build but dull characters.

•The Abyss above us ( just a sloppy story).   

•Beneath the Ring by Premee Mohamed  books - Characterization/romance kills the story for me, comes of as YA. Good world building, though.

•Anomaly Flats ( Weird town troupe but not well done, the main character sucks as a human being).  

•The Others Series - I just couldn’t get into it. 

•Boom (Harry Potter meets George Washington/period fanfic but ridiculous with huge plot hole - at one point the MC fight evil suits, like the literal clothing item)

•The Gone World - Good core concept, badly executed. A classic example of men writing women poorly).   

But hey, that’s just like my opinion, so if you like any of the above more power too ya!!

Ok, so now add your favorites and suggestions please!!!

1709735024.0,Looking for dead space/ diseased horror,"Hey everyone, I was playing the dead space remake and kinda wanted to listen to some books with similar vibes. Particularly the enclosed environment, and the characters getting chased and picked off. Doesn't have to be in space or the future, the only monster or whatever I don't care for is ghosts/spirits. Just never liked or cared for them. Was also interested in something more diseased based. The only requirement is being on audible. I listen to audiobooks during my shift and don't have the time to sit down and read during my freetime. I've listen to the troop, the last plague and from below. The only one I didn't like was from below. The last plague was good but I didn't care for the narrator at all. Thank you in advance",horrorlit
1709733361.0,"Just finished the Final Destination Books...looking for more like that! (Gamified death - ""We must figure out what's killing us before it picks us off one by one!"")","Looking for adventuresome books where the characters are trying to deal with something that's picking them off in a manner that they need to figure out/fight to win against. 

Doesn't matter too much what it is! Cursed object, monster, shadowy demon. Whatever! Bonus points if it's something that I get to learn about as the book progresses.

I'd prefer if it's not just a standard serial killer. In fact, the more ""human"" the killer is, the less interested I am. Something along the lines of Battle Royale or the Escape Room movies, is fine, since an entity making people play death games is right up my alley, but a dude in a mask just isn't for me. 

Interesting/weird deaths are also a major plus. 

Books kind of in the same vein that I've read and liked - **The Ruins, The Troop, Dead Silence, Amulet, Rolling in the Deep/Into the Drowning Deep.** 

The writing should at least aspire to good...I'm unfortunately a bit of a snob and can't really sacrifice writing for story. 

Thanks in advance, and I promise to one day recommend the perfect book to one of you. 😊",horrorlit
1709727849.0,The Lovely Bones,"This book was not really what I had anticipated. Given that I could watch the film, I was expecting some sort of thriller or mystery-solving novel involving a dead girl, driven by revenge to help people solve a murder.

This is not what I got at all. The Lovely Bones was more about grieving families, if anything else, and watching as a fly on the wall. There were some thriller elements but far and few between.

With The Lovely Bones, I felt like you had to be in a specific mood to finish it. I did find it quite difficult to read, as I dragged my heels throughout the entire book, realising it was not going to be the thriller I expected.

The more I think back to the story, the more I note that it is a well-written book but just not to be fooled by the film feature. The book is nowhere near as exciting as the movie, and can definitely drag. 

Abigail, Susie's mother, was literally the worst. I absolutely loathed her as a character—an utterly disgusting, cowardly woman who literally ditched her only other child and husband to go ""soul-searching."" I wanted to push her and her ocean eyes into the sinkhole. We don't need any more deadbeat parents in this world!

If you're a horror lover, I wouldn't recommend this book to you. It's more a book giving you a different perspective on life, maybe helping you appreciate what you have. It makes you realise and remember that everybody is disposable at any point; you could lose someone you love in a horrible accident in a matter of days.

I liked aspects of the book, but it definitely wasn't my favorite.",horrorlit
1709722722.0,The Watchers,"This was a very satisfying read, considering I had just wandered into Waterstones and looked at a few books that caught my fancy. Thanks to all you guys who recommended this book; it was a delight.

The overall atmosphere in this book was described beautifully and left me with a chill down to my core. I really felt emerged in the world, especially the intertwined forest!

Mina was a safe protagonist to follow. I loved that she brought a Golden Conya named ""The Yellow One"" with her literally everywhere. I knew that was symbolic of hope, considering she was trapped in a literal nightmare!

I'll be honest; I felt like this book was missing one tiny detail, and that's a bit of intimacy. In this cruel world, if there’s a few people trapped in a forest surrounded by monsters and there is an attractive young lad named Daniel, obviously interested in a girl like Mina, there would normally be a little action. It brings the whole realism factor into play, and adds more layers to their relationship.

I saw the twist coming halfway through the book, so I wasn't surprised when I was right. I felt like the author mentioned too many specific things that would be hard to miss. Despite that, I still very much enjoyed the story! The scene with Keira’s house was honestly terrifying, and I was on the edge of my seat.

A very good book; I would thoroughly recommend it if you enjoy creepy creatures in the woods!",horrorlit
1709716065.0,Horror recommendations: not supernatural/paranormal ,"I'm after some horror book recommendations. I love horror but nothing seems to scare me. 

As with films, I prefer human horror to monsters/supernatural/paranormal etc. I'm not into fantasy or sci-fi either. If it can happen in real life, that's what gets me. I'm ok with gore but not if it overtakes the plot. 

Last few horrors I've read:

Gone To See The River Man - Kristopher Triana (didn't like the folklore parts)

The Venue - T.J Payne (fun but nothing original)

Brother - Ania Ahlborn (loved this!)

1709699471.0,The Ruins,"I’m reeling. So much about this book has filled me with dread and horror and sadness. Some thoughts:
- The description of Eric’s final moments in which he flays himself is among the most brutal I’ve ever read. I was squirming under my covers the entire time. 
- Stacy’s suicide is so profoundly sad. The terror of being alone there makes me feel like there’s an anvil on my chest.
- The novel feels so incredibly hopeless, yet I was constantly thinking of a way for even one character to survive. That being said, I like how Smith subverted the expectations of Amy being a “final girl” type.
- I can’t decide how I feel about Jeff. I’m a fan of characters that cause internal conflict. 
- The dread I felt at the end when the Greeks showed up…
- At times I felt that Mathias had intentionally led them to the ruins, which I definitely think was purposeful on Smith’s part. He’s an interesting character.
- I’ve realized that some of my favorite horror has concerned parasitic creatures (The Troop, a particular scene from My Best Friend’s Exorcism). Something about playing host fills me with terror.

I did get The Slob from them (had to order from Denver) and the 2nd part is on order. They didn’t have access to anything else.

1709650107.0,Never thought horror writing could scare me until Christopher Buehlman's Between Two Fires,"Disclaimer: I have only recently started reading novels again. I've always loved comics and that's where I've stayed since I graduated HS (I'm 29 now) because back then reading novels was a chore. I'm not the biggest horror fan in general, but the synopsis of Between Two Fires intrigued me. People said it was horrifying, but I didn't believe an author could truly scare me with merely words. For those that have read this book - I just finished chapter 11 or 12, the part where Delphine, Thomas, and the priest stay with the Woodcarver and his wife in Paris. As the statues knock from door to door getting closer and Mary eventually gets into their house I bet I had a BPM of 120. The description of Annette and Jehan's death was brutal, the visual of the dead baby being thrown around swarmed by flies was unsettling, and Thomas' initial failed attempts at taking the statue down gave me a sinking feeling. Just when you think it's over, as the trio pass the church from which the statues came and are mentally attacked by the statues... it took me a bit to fall asleep last night. I can definitely say I'm a fan of what a good horror novel can do.",horrorlit
1709638077.0,In the Suicide Motor Club is Judith... *MASSIVE SPOILER WARNING*,"Recently finished the above and enjoyed it like a lot of Buhleman's books I hate the ending initially then love it later.

Anyways, at the end of the book I felt quite a few hints were dropped that Judith had become a vampire in the final pages. During the big climatic battle she gets bit a couple of times and though it never says anything along the lines of her blood being drank and then spat back in (the way vampires are made in this universe) it seems fairly plausible with all the throwing around in the car and the fight this could easily happen accidentally.

Shortly after this when Judith is walking towards Luther with the big cross she gets shot in the stomach, but as she marches towards him the bullet comes out and the wound heals just like for the vampires. It is still vague though as the cross does have supernatural powers ie heals itself, creates a huge explosion which wipes out Luther and Neck Brace.

Later on it seems less likely because Judith does go into the sun to kill Robert so it would appear she's not a vampire except for two things:

a) despite there only being a relatively short time since the sun rose and Judith getting back to Clayton's hiding spot she has 'severe sunburn'.

and

b) a passing comment is made to how 'older vampires burn quicker.'

At the very least I think Buhleman is being ambiguous and suggesting that due to her only being turned minutes earlier the sun would weaken her/burn her, but not to the level we've seen on the older vampires. 

Personally, I believe she was turned. What do you guys think? I've tried searching for this topic but to my surprise none seems to have written about this theory so am curious about what others think? ",horrorlit

In the past year or so I’ve become a big fan of classic gothic/victorian horror, and I’m wondering if anyone had any good recommendations for novels or short stories with a specific gothic amosphere to them. Dracula and Dorian Gray most capture the vibe that I love, with a very gloomy and atmospheric London setting and slow, methodical pacing. I’ve recently been reading more short horror stories of the period (Poe, Henry James, Etc.) and while I do love them I’m having trouble finding something that really encapsulates the very dark gothic vibes of Dorian Gray & Dracula- any recommendations? I typically only like older literature like that but I’d be open to newer stuff too.
Thanks!

UPDATE: At some of you guys’ recommendation, I have finally read all of Frankenstein and am now about halfway through Wuthering Heights (I know, I read fast) and while I enjoyed Frankenstein a lot, it felt more like proto sci-fi than the bleak atmospheric horror or drama I like- but I am LOVING Wuthering Heights, definitely similar vibes to Dorian Gray as a few of you have said.

I also really love cold atmospheres like Ararat (Golden), Stolen Tongues (Blackwell), Road of Bones (Golden), Dead of Winter (Coates), The Shuddering (Ahlborn).  My bookstores do bot really have much to choose from so I am stuck within a little circle of authors as you might notice.  
  
I would love any campy suggestions, stuff to do with hiking or extreme environments.  I also really enjoy creature features or spooky space setting slike Parasite (Coates) and Dead Silence (S. A. Barnes).  Really liked The Haar (Sodergren) as well.

1709607230.0,Jennifer McMahon part 2 (spoilers),"Well well well, 
Here I am again. 
Last time I covered my distaste for endings in the Invited, Children on the Hill, and the Winter People. Now I give you the drowning kind, and the night sisters.
Drowning kind? I applaud it. The mystery of the water kept me reeling and hooked me in. Layered characters and everything- however I am a sucker for explanations, I just so badly wanted to know what, when, why the pool is the way it is. The ending however? I think it was perfect. Kind of she finally chose a good stopping point and didn’t over complicate it. 
Night Sisters? I loved the base. A firm base, with eerie elements all over. But, this one did leave me disappointed by the last half. With this one, I felt she revealed her secret surprise twist too ample too early, cause I had it figured out. But also it just didn’t creep me out enough, I also wanted a back story on why their family was cursed to be the way they were? Also they treated Rose so horribly, and I felt like the whole uncle Fenton-sylvie affair needed to be a bigger deal. 
I did like the base better than the drowning kind, but drowning kind won with ending it right. The family inheriting the Marr thing, I just think it was a last minute rash decision.

1709578995.0,My Darling Girl: I have some THOUGHTS on Alison’s husband,"I read My Darling Girl by Jennifer McMahon in January, and I’m still mad about the way Alison’s husband acts throughout that book. I hated him so much I wished they’d kill him off, honestly. Like, your mother-in-law, who has a record of abuse and mistreatment of your wife, moves in to die in your house. Your wife’s mental state begins to decline as she claims her mother is treating her differently behind closed doors than she is in front of the rest of the family. Do you believe your wife that MIL is back to her old tricks and tell her mother to GTFO and die on the street like the abusive PoS she is know to be? No, how about instead you let the known abuser continue to live in your house and torment your wife. When your wife complains, convince her that SHE’S the one who’s losing it and that she’s cruel for wanting her out of the house.

Like, come ON. I think this book hit close to home because I have major mommy issues, but it makes me go a little insane when people won’t believe victims of abuse even when it’s right in front of them. “You need to be nicer to your mom” was a refrain I heard all the time growing up, because abusers are EXTREMELY capable of pretending to be another person in front of others. Sure, she’s nice to you, but she ISN’T nice to me, and her being occasionally nice doesn’t cancel out the bad shit she’s done. If my partner sided with my mother over me on something like this, I would never be able to move past it. Ever. It would be an instant relationship over. 

It’s so crazy how the entire plot of the book could be resolved by the husband saying “okay that’s enough of that, you need to leave” after the first couple incidents, and it’s even crazier to me that Alison can bear to look at him after all is said and done. Me personally? I think I would be committing homicide.",horrorlit

1709573779.0,Episode Thirteen by Craig DiLouie,"So I just finished Episode Thirteen and honestly I really loved it. I had originally bought the physical book but due to work life balance and a spotify account, I was able to listen to the audiobook version in between breaks and car rides to work. First of all, the audiobook is absolutely amazing. The quality that was put into not only the voice acting, but the background ambiance as well. I mean, every single glass shatter, growl, and electrical hum just added to much to the quality. Now as for the book itself, I’m not going to lie, I wasn’t expecting the total insanity the book devolved into in the second half. I can say that I havent personally gotten to the juggernaut that is House of Leaves yet so I cannot really say that I see the comparisons. All of this aside, what do we think of the book and it’s overall themes and crazy ass ending?

But I just finished My Heart Struck Sorrow by John Hornor Jacobs after devouring it in one sitting and I adored it. What made it such a strong piece (besides the masterful prose itself) was how well-balanced its use of ambiguity was and now I'm wanting more at the same level of execution. 

It may be relevant to mention that I wasn't a fan of The Sea Dreams it is the Sky by the same author as it was too subtle and I found it kind of boring. I've never been a fan of Hawthorne either, though it has been a while since I read anything by him. ",horrorlit
1709537228.0,I read the wrong Exquisite Corpse,"Reading through this sub I heard about the book Exquisite Corpse and how interesting the writing was, so I decided to read it.

I did not take note of the author (how many books called Exquisite Corpse could there be??) And borrowed it from my library.

Turns out I had borrowed the Marija Pericic version rather than the Poppy Z Brite version mentioned in this sub.

This book is still a horror, but rather than a book about a serial killer, it is about the lengths a person will go to preserve the one they love.

The horror elements come in slowly but they are pretty much exactly what you would expect from a book with the title Exquisite Corpse and the tag line ""romance is dead"". 

I enjoyed this book because of the story, but also the fact that it was written as an actual exquisite corpse (a writing game where different people take up the thread of the story and continue it https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse). 

I have now borrowed the 'correct' version of the book and am interested to see how they compare.
