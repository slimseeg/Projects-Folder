1712692239.0,WOOM: why?,"All of the people who have recommended the ‘horror’ book WOOM, why? That’s not horror, it’s gore porn! Literally. I just finished it (only because once I start a book, no matter how terrible, I *have* to finish it.) 

Potential spoilers ahead,  don’t know how to make the text grey….

This book was edgy for the sake of itself. Unnecessarily gross, and WAY too sexual, and I’m no prude…I typically like sexy stuff in books. I kinda get the ‘why’ of that, based on the ultimate end, but it was just SO descriptive, when it didn’t need to be. 

I expected, going in with no knowledge of the contents, some extreme HORROR, but it was just… gag-worthy and disgusting. If you think that disgust is an element of horror, then this is the book for you. But it wasn’t *scary* at all. In the traditional sense of ‘horror literature.’ I had to force myself to finish it. 

Also- it was SO predictable. People have mentioned a ‘twist’ but I saw that shit coming a mile away. Granted the last few paragraphs were sort of unexpected, but in retrospect, the ending was alluded to many times. 

Not to mention the typos and grammatical errors! I was disappointed and annoyed by the numerous misspellings, wrong pronouns for established characters, etc. like the editor just gave up and started skimming at some point, and I wish I had too. 

Overall- I wouldn’t recommend this book at all, to anyone, especially someone looking for a genuinely ‘scary’ read! Nothing scary about it, only gore and gross. Hah. 

What’s the appeal- for the fans? For people who have recommended this book (countless times in this sub) Why do you suggest it? Did you enjoy it? Was it scary to you? Were you frightened, or appalled and disgusted? I’m genuinely curious about the appeal. Is it more of a ‘shock’ thing, or an ‘I’ve had to experience this, and so should you?’ Or did you really enjoy the read? Were you scared? 

I can see how disgust can be an *element* of horror, but Mr. Ralston just seemed to rely on that aspect alone to carry the entire book. 

I don’t know what to do with this thing now. I can’t give it away, can’t sell it to my book-buyer… it’s seriously the only book I’ve EVER considered just burying in the yard to save others the trouble. It was *terrible!* (of course I’d never destroy a book, just gonna have to hold onto it until I find someone who’s *super* into gore-porn books🤷‍♀️) 

Please share your thoughts, reviews, reasons for recommending…whatever. Thanks y’all.

1712685045.0,Dracula! My first book,"I just finished reading dracula which is my first ever novel

I really enjoyed it this i understand why this is stated as a classic in the horror genre.

The first act was definitely the best part of the book, i wished they explored it more the castle was extremely well done the tone was set really nicely and dracula crawling on the castle walls sent chills down my spine.
Every character is really well done the chemistry between all the characters is really good the bromance between all the male characters was great to read

It was a little boring at some parts which could have been well done and the ending was a little anticlimactic, I hoped dracula would put up a fight before going down.

Mina, van Helsing, renfield were my favourite characters.

Some scenes were really emotional and you can feel the exact emotion the characters are feeling as the writing is so detailed and delicate,

Some really frustrating and face palm movements too.

I wanted to see more of dracula too he has too little of screen time for having the whole book named after him(but I also think it adds to his mystery, and cunningness).


Over all a really good read!

Thanks for reading my very badly written experience 😅

I like cosmic, gothic, and folklorey type of horror books but so much of it feels so academic. Trying way too hard to sound smart or be complicated. Kingfisher uses a lot of general common language and her books feel more like a friend telling you a story.

Humanity has been devoured to the edge of extinction by the ever-ravenous Shivers - terrifying, shapeless creatures that latch onto their hosts, tormenting them over time before consuming them all at once. The last of civilization lives in the crumbling city of Atlas, where they subsist on processed insects and await their inevitable fate. Anthem is the city Exilist, tasked with trapping the Shivers and banishing them to the malevolent Deadlands outside the city walls. But Anthem is ailing and destined to soon fall victim to his own Shiver, a fate he's reluctantly accepted. As Anthem begins to withdraw from his world, a threat he's unprepared for comes hurtling home. If he is to save anyone, he will have to travel into the Deadlands in search of a remedy to tame these creatures. But no Atlas dweller has ever made it back alive, and Anthem must confront his own darkness before humankind is forever lost to the monsters in our shadows.""

*These events are presented outside of chronological order and deal primarily with the efforts of the viewpoint characters to both escape the town and find answers to what has happened in the three days immediately following the disaster.*  
*Initially presented as being merely an earthquake the disaster is rapidly shown to be far more bizarre and wide-ranging. The majority of the population has become infected with an unknown affliction that appears to severely damage cognitive function, causing them to bleed from the eyes, become violently hostile on sight towards anyone not also infected and seemingly immortal, able to recover and heal from even the most grievous of injuries in a short time. All natural water sources and rainfall in the town have been replaced with a strange liquid (referred to as ""Red water"") and the town, previously located in a mountainous region deep inland, has become an island surrounded on all sides by an ocean of the red water with no other land in sight. Furthermore, multiple sections of the town appear to have been replaced with past versions of themselves with buildings destroyed by landslides 27 years prior, although derelict as if abandoned for decades, suddenly reappearing or replacing their more modern counterparts.*

1712600554.0,Am I unfit for horror books?,"Hi all. 

I would like to say I am such a big fan of the horror genre as a whole. 
- My favorite film genre is horror. 
-Playing horror games with friends is so much fun. 
-Halloween and October have always been my favorite time of the year. 
So naturally, I wanted to give horror books a try.

I started at the beginning of this year with The Troop. I thought it was fine, it just didn’t have an engaging story. But where my real troubles began was with The Girl Next Door. 

I didn’t really know what I was getting into with that book. And even if I did, I don’t think it would have stopped me from at least trying it. But roughly 3/4 of the way through, I had to put it down never to return again. I felt incredibly angry that adults like this exist in the real world, and I remember the disgust that stayed with me for multiple days after.

After a week or two of reading something else, I turned to Stephen King. Having seen many of Stephen King’s adaptations on the big screen, I wanted to try a story I had no knowledge of. And that story, was Pet Sematary.

I was really loving it at first. The mystery, the setting, and the characters all had me intrigued. But halfway through the book I had to DNF. I was too sad. I got a couple chapters past part 2 and couldn’t go any further. It was affecting my mood. 

Maybe I’ll give it another shot one day, but those stories were just so damn depressing. My question is: should I bother reading more horror? I know those were only two books, so maybe they’re rather extreme examples. But movies and games have never knocked me out quite like that. And I’m afraid of running into the same situation again.

Does anyone have advice?",horrorlit

But I have been reading nothing but H.P.L. for quite some time so I decided to try the King in Yellow as I find it mentioned a lot in lovecraftian media (I was mainly effected by the Myscatonic Mysteries MC mod). I must say I enjoyed the first short story, but its not at all what I hoped for and what I was imagined from what I saw from fandoms and etc. 

So thats my rant about the book and now for my question.

1712595855.0,Does anyone else find that Adam Nevill makes eldritch horror more accessible to those who normally wouldn't read those types of horror stories?,"I always feel a little left out (not really, but ykwim) when people are talking about their favorite Lovecraftian/eldritch/cosmic horror books and how terrifying they find those types of stories. I've never been a huge fan of them myself and have never really found them ""scary"". Maybe I'm too dumb to conceptualize the terror of confronting something like Cthulu or some other old god that has been around for millions of years and doesn't care if I live or die.

I've read many of this sub's favorites in the genre: The Fisherman, Revival, Books of Blood, etc. And while I have enjoyed them somewhat and can certainly say that they are well-written stories (Clive Barker epecially has such a beautiful and vivid writing style and I love him), I've never found them scary and have had a hard time understanding what exactly makes them scare others.

Enter Adam Nevill. I'm still going through his bibliography, but after reading a few of his books, I can say that his approach to eldritch horror resonates with me so much more than the ""classics"" of the genre and has made me appreciate and understand the raw terror that the more traditional authors of the genre can instill in their readers.

So far, I have read The Ritual, The Reddening, and No One Gets Out Alive. All three of them were terrifying for me because they start off by appealing to something that truly scares me, personally: the fear of being hunted by an unknown entity in the wilderness; the fear of stumbling upon a violent cult who will ensure you have a painful and undignified death; and the fear of a malignant spirit/demon slowly causing someone's mind to degrade into mindless and murderous rage. I mean, I don't wake up each day with these fears in my head, but I can put myself in those situations as I'm reading and identify with the terror the characters must be feeling.

Each one of these stories has landed in the realm of eldritch/cosmic horror by the end, and I'm so grateful to Adam Nevill for telling these stories in a way that makes me understand why people love them. I think he does a great job of putting his characters into seemingly more modern and relatable situations and slowly dragging them through unimaginable horror that ends up being caused by an ancient god/demon that has no regard for, or even utter hatred for, human life and/or suffering. I feel like I finally understand why the genre is loved by so many horrorlit fans. Now I want to go re-read a few books and look at them in a different light.

Has anyone else had this experience? Did this make any sense at all? I was trying to tell my husband my thoughts on this the other night when I finished No One Gets Out Alive, and he looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language, lol.

ETA I'm planning to start Last Days this evening and can't wait - I've heard it's really scary.",horrorlit

1712582012.0,Educational institution/teacher/teacher figure horror,"Hey! This sub has been great in helping me find horror reads, so I want to try my luck again… 

What I am *NOT* looking for: 

- abusive teachers (as the only focus, they can be part of the plot) who are in the system *only* to abuse it for their other unrelated goal. I.e. groomers or teachers trying to get revenge on an enemy through that enemy's child. 
- horror in educational institution setting but the setting can easily be replaced with a different one. 

What I am looking for:  

- teachers and teacher figures as antiheroes or villains with complex morals *related to their role as teachers*.
- educational systems as a horror element.  

I recently read Eileen by Ottesa Moshfegh and was rather disappointed by how little focus was put on the actual schoolwork and vigilantism plotlines. I picked this book hoping that this would be the main theme, but it was not. 

If you imagine Eileen, but the story is about Rebecca and how she goes around forcing confessions out of (who she believes are) bad parents, this would be close to what I am looking for. It doesn’t have to be about punishing parents. I mean it in terms of the general focus. 

In terms of the vibes(!) I am also thinking about Matilda (children’s book), Girl from Nowhere (Thai TV show), Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei (manga and anime), and Assassination Classroom (manga and anime). These titles are about schools, but I would be more than glad to read something with a similar premise but in a different type of educational establishment - college, university, fictional correctional facility, anything that fits the bill.",horrorlit

Ok the book it was wow there was so much I could comment on this is the first book I've read my Alison Rumfitt and it was intense.

I couldn't steer away from the constant thought of how everything happening from the parasite metaphor to the kink to Frankie's and Vanya's relationship all just being a fucked up metaphor for love and obsession. The way both were hypersexual as a way to get some form of intimacy and love and ending up getting into a situationship with each. The fact that Alison had the entire book to wrap around and foreshadow the ending, it was gorgeous. It felt that so much of the book held metaphors in every other line and it truly was so enjoyable to dissect the book while reading. It was also a buddy read so it was a ride getting to read it with a friend. Truly an enjoyable read, probably an 9/10 for me, I don't think I'll ever forget it.",horrorlit

This Wretched Valley - Jenny Kiefer: One of the best horror openings since The Empty Man (the movie, sorry I’m crossing mediums.) I read it in one sitting. Highly recommend if you want a gripping, genuinely creepy and original page-turner and don’t mind a bit of gore. Blaire Witch on steroids. And it’s her debut novel!! 

A Child Alone with Strangers - Philip Fracassi: Impeccably paced with characters you could read about forever. It manages to perfectly balance horror with humanity. It’s weird and sad and not for the faint of heart. 

Echo - Thomas Olde Heuvelt: One of the strangest books I’ve read in a while. Again, an opening that will give you goosebumps and similar to This Wretched Valley in that there’s a “haunted nature” vibe.

Little Heaven - Nick Cutter: I’m super late to this and I know it’s not his most talked about book - but I loved this one the best. I got way too attached to the characters, was hooked by the duel timelines and the punch-in-the-gut ending solidified this as a great book for me.

What ensued was some of the most unique, claustrophobic scenes with incredibly realistic scuba diving and (presumably) realistic whale guts doing what whale guts do. Usually, the immersion is broken when a book uses scuba diving due to some small inaccuracy that most people wouldn’t even think to include, but the only time I surfaced (hehe) was to point out everything I recognized as familiar. Amazing prose, fantastic planting and payoff 10/10 no notes. (Ok some notes, but any issue I had was subjective gripes that don’t take away from the effectiveness of the story. )

1712448870.0,No one gets out alive - infuriating plot point or not?,"I'm currently reading Adam Nevill's No One Gets Out Alive, minor spoilers ahead I suppose.

Stephanie is trapped in this awful house because she has no money and can't find work. She frequently frets about her desperate financial situation - it's a crucial plot point because otherwise she could have left in the first chapter.

But every time we're reminded of how broke she is, I can't stop thinking about why she wouldn't be on social security benefits, or take steps to get them. It's literally the first thing you do when unemployed and looking for work - not that she'd be rolling in cash, which sort of makes it even more annoying because it could easily have been incorporated into the story to make it feel more authentic. As it is though, her poverty feels too contrived to keep her there, like a cheap plot device or like the author has not experienced/properly researched experiences of poverty.

It is making it difficult for me to buy into the story - probably because I have been in a similarly desperate situation (sans all the supernatural despair) when younger and it doesn't ring true that you wouldn't look into unemployment payments/youth allowance or whatever they have in the UK. 

On the other hand, I'm perfectly aware I might just be hyper focused on unimportant semantics or ignorant to the UK social support system (I'm Australian).

1712344568.0,Negative space ,"I would like to start by saying I am NOT a huge reader. I do not read a lot, but I’ve been looking for a good horror book that deals with existentialism and Negative Space by B.R. Yeager seemed right up my alley. And up my alley it absolutely was. This novel was truly a disturbing, disgusting, and soul sucking masterpiece. 

It is easily the most bleak piece of media I have ever sunk my teeth into. Every time I put down the book I just sat there for at least 10 minutes, pondering on what was going on. Nothing has ever left me so speechless, so shaken, and so genuinely scared for characters in a story. 

I do think that the ending felt a little… lackluster in comparison to the start and middle parts of the book, but I also think it wraps it up in a surreal and “up for interpretation” type of way, which fits for the novel. 

The characters were all so, so interesting. Lu and Jill epically, but Ahmir wasn’t bad by any means. And Tyler was an amazing character, I was so insanely engaged every time his name popped up or something involving him was occurring. 

I can’t get over how brilliant the writing is. The sharp and disturbing diction tossed around touched me in more ways than one. I love how Yeager used different phrases for simple things. Like, for example, how he would write “going wet” and “going full wet” instead of crying. And how he never said people were mad or sad, instead opting for “her eyes had knives. Knives and full blue” 

Lastly, the trio of main characters and the way their perspective shifts is so entertaining and intriguing to read. Having two characters in the same place and seeing both of their thoughts as the narration flipped between them was genius. I also am obsessed with how Tyler is definitely a main character, but the only main character that isn’t in this frame. 

I’m wondering what other people think about this book. Please let me know! And if you know any books in a similar vain to this one, please drop the title and author 🙏",horrorlit

1712337942.0,Geek Love by Katherine Dunn,"
Has anyone read Geek Love by Katherine Dunn? 

I’m not sure if it would be classed more as literary fiction rather than horror, or a mix of both, but the premise is a couple who own a travelling circus experiment with drugs and poison during their pregnancies to have children they can make shows out of. It was devastating and horrifying and honestly one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. I felt so much for (most of) the characters.

I mostly enjoyed the perspective of the narrator (one of the children)  who had never known anything different to the awful life she was living (this is what made me cry the most, just the fact she didn’t understand what was so bad about her life). Sort of a similar perspective to Brother by Ania Ahlborn where the main character knows no different to the horrors he commits. Or if you’ve seen the movie Dogtooth where the parents shelter their children from the outside world completely. 

I know this is probably a weird perspective to want to read from but I find it so interesting.

One of these experiences, that has great influence over many of us, is love. I don't quite know what that would look like, or if it even exists, but I would love to read a story that plays on our concepts of love, desire, affection; and uses, manipulates it in order to create horror. So, I am not referring to your typical romance novel - I'm not looking to feel the rush of a well crafted love story. I'm searching for something that will lead me to philosophically question our conception love, in existential horror fashion.

1712240131.0,just finished the ritual by adam nevill--i have thoughts to discuss! spoilers below.,"so, i've seen a few posts about this novel here, but none of them super recent and none of them actually about the thing that bothered me the most about this book. since i just finished it, i decided to throw my hat in the discussion ring.

to preface, i want to say i LOVED this book. i was concerned at first, because everything seemed to be happening so fast compared to the length of the book, but eventually it completely sucked me in and i forgot to wonder ""why am i only halfway through when so much has happened?"" i found the pacing absolutely riveting, and adam nevill conveys such wonderful feelings of wrongness and despair.

that being said, i've seen many people voice complaints with the second half of the book. i actually loved pretty much all of the book, and the black metal cult didn't bother me or strike me as cheap--imo, a cult would have been much more cliche, and i liked the chaos of these three young adults clashing with the existing presence of an old religion there in the forest.

no, my main nitpick with this novel actually comes with literally the last three pages. i hadn't seen anyone bring this up before--most convos about this novel seem to revolve around the black metal band--but i felt like it was so unsatisfying to have luke survive all that only for the novel to end with such an obvious, vague idea like ""in the grand scheme of things, humans don't really matter to the universe"". did anyone else feel that way?

throughout the entire novel, luke seemed preoccupied with the idea of being lonely, with not forming connections with the people around him and being generally dissatisfied with life. at one point, he decides that he's going to live purposefully if he survives his ordeal, and i feel like that would have been a much more satisfying end to the novel.

thoughts? critiques? all are welcome! i'm curious if anyone felt the same way. i honestly liked the ending of the movie a little better, just because luke screaming back at moder felt so satisfying!",horrorlit

1712205370.0,Thoughts on the Haunting of Hill House TV show?,"I saw a post on Shirley Jackson and it made me think of Haunting of Hill House. I watched it a while ago and thought it was great. I went and read the book afterwards, and my opinion of it changed. The original book centers around the relationship between Eleanor and Theodora, and all of the mysterious hauntings build up to the dramatic ending. It's really brilliant. The tv show is just completely different, and in my opinion would have been much better as an original show. It had some cool ideas- I liked how they wove together the different timelines. Although there were some issues with it that weren't adaptation related, mainly with the pacing. 

There's a lot of issues with the show, but I think the worst part is probably that they gutted the character of Theodora. They made her boring! As a lesbian myself, I don't think that the tv show is ""better representation"" than the book because they made her sexuality more explicit (although it's already pretty obvious in the book). In fact I think that it was kind of homophobic that she was written to kiss her sister's husband for no reason. When I watched it I assumed that was something from that book that they kept in, but it wasn't. Genuinely no clue why that was in there- to add drama? 

There were also a lot of elements that were kept in but just didn't make sense because of the changes to the show. For example, when she tells the story about throwing a rock at a greenhouse in the book, it's to show her rebellious nature. But in the show, she's not written as rebellious so it just feels pointless.

I will say though, the one thing I didn't like about the book is the dialogue, because it felt stilted and unnatural. I don't read a lot of older books so it could be because I'm not used to that. But I think there's potential in a modern adaptation of the book to update that element.",horrorlit

1712174890.0,Review of Devil House by John Darnielle,"I have seldom felt so ill-used by a book.

Some of this can be laid at the feet of marketing because ""horror"" sounds more appealing than ""pseudointellectual navel-gazed larded with vaporous flourishes of elegant, empty nonsense.""  The cover certainly seems to hint at horrors within, with its creepy manse whose shadow looks like a bat and its synopsis that whispers of unfathomable truths slowly, inexorably revealed.  There is no reason to think it's not horror; it's even labeled as such on Goodreads and in library lookup systems.

Except that the only horror on view is the insufferable tedium of Darnielle's obsession with sacrificing the numerous kernels of tantalizing story in favor of showing off his l33t literary skills.  Oh, you thought you were getting a small-town true crime story?  Rube!  Let me jump to this *other* small-town horror story instead.  Oh, you were getting invested in that story?  Gullible dolt!  Have some nonsensical, Old English bafflegab in an eye-watering font instead!  Because I'm smart, see?  Smart enough to know Old English and its narrative conventions!  What a clever boy am I!  

But not smart enough to know the difference between present tense and preterite conjugations in Spanish, alas.  If you're going to be insufferable and grating in the service of flaunting your obvious superiority, you should at least be correct about it.

I *wanted* to like this.  Some of the prose was engrossing and had a dreamy, serene quality, and the hook of an unsolved crime in a small town was catnip.  But there's only so much joy I can take in some pompous doofus prating about his amazing investigatory technique and ability to read people.  Eventually, the story needs to progress, to fulfill the promise made in the early pages, but this one never does.  It just spins in a morass of self-indulgence and peters out like a defective squib.  There are no revelations and certainly no revelations to justify the time sunk into this excursion because...

None of it is true.  It was all made up by Darnielle to make true crime readers feel bad for enjoying true crime book(but writers aren't equally awful for exploiting and profiting off that enjoyment, oh, dear, no).  The mysteries and characters you invested in and waded through 400 pages never existed.  Ha ha!  Don't you feel stupid?  Wasn't I so brilliant?

Twists like this can work if the author has established trust with the reader, and has worked to tell a good story through which to thread his social commentary.  Darnielle did neither of these things; instead, he engaged in egotistic intellectual masturbation for 400 pages and expected us to gawp in awe in the soporific afterglow.

He can shove his pretension where the sun don't shine and hope it passes with the next quinoa smoothie.

1712174053.0,Shirley Jackson is Brilliant,"I just wanted to post to say how brilliant Shirley Jackson is. I’m currently reading The Sundial (no spoilers please!) and it’s excellent. I’ve also read The Haunting of Hill House, We Have Always Lived in the Castle, alongside a couple of her short story collections (The Lottery and Other Short Stories, Dark Tales, and Let Me Tell You).

While I classify her work as horror, it has such a unique character to it. She can build so much unease in apparently ordinary situations. Her characters are all just a bit odd, but it’s difficult to pinpoint what exactly is odd about them. She can build tension so well, and make everyday things feel strange. Her prose is so elegant. All her writing just flows wonderfully. A lot of her writing is very witty too.

I enjoy horror and other genres a lot, but there’s not many authors that make me feel the way Shirley Jackson can. This might be stereotypical, but the only other author that makes me feel a similar way is Stephen King. King and Jackson are definitely my two favourite horror writers.",horrorlit
1712172376.0,"Finished The Creeper by AM Shine. Um, what was that ending?","Seriously, what? The Creeper is just… a guy? I really didn’t enjoy this book much, and the ending made me laugh out loud. The only creepy element of the book is a guy. Standing there menacingly. This makes no sense. First of all, why does the weird village cult not just kill Starling? Clearly the rules don’t matter since he dies at the end of the book despite not having seen the Creeper, and he is consistently a bother to them. Why keep murdering these random researchers instead of just dealing with the source of the issue? Clearly his continued existence doesn’t matter since, again, they murder him at the request of some dude who wandered in. Secondly, how does this guy know they’re gonna look out the window? Is he just standing in front of the living room glass, hoping they don’t walk to the kitchen? If you see him and don’t tell anyone, and he doesn’t see you see him, how does the legend get enforced? There’s no way none of those village kids haven’t peeked out the window and caught a glimpse. I have more questions than I started with, and none of them were answered by the book.",horrorlit

1712159122.0,Horror that bleeds into reality.,"Just a thought. Nothing too deep. Everyone has their own personal preferences on what is “good horror”…..and I was thinking back on some of the most enjoyable novels I’ve read through the years. Many of them had themes that I could personally identify with at the time of reading. Idk if I even realized the connection at the time, but after looking back, it was definitely there.

For example, I started How To Sell A Haunted House by Grady Hendrix when it first came out. Couldn’t really get into it. About 20% in, stopped. Just wasn’t doing it for me. Fast forward to the present. Mom has passed and Dad is in hospice with a limited amount of time remaining unfortunately. So, I’m looking for something a little lighter than say, Edward Lee as I flew out to see dad and restarted HTSAHH. Absolutely hooked now and I’m sure it’s the similarities between the brother and sister and the deceased parents in the story and the reality that my parents will both be gone (from this plane) soon. I can definitely relate more to the characters and narrative this time around. Just some food for thought. I’m sure many of you have experienced the same thing.

One thing to note, I'm not typically the biggest fan of body horror, which this novel is rife with, but it was handled properly and paced well enough that it didn't bother me or feel forced, in my opinion.
 
There are some unique concepts that are utilized in a very clever way, especially towards the latter end of the novel.

1712112357.0,Ending of Intercepts: a quick question (spoilers ahead),"**SPOILERS AHEAD**

So I just finished reading Intercepts by T.J. Payne and I have a quick question about the veeeeery ending of the book. It has to do with the last few paragraphs about Mr. Aguirre. 

“Mr. Aguirre had to turn away from that smiling Antenna. The smile unnerved him. He gently set down his tablet, removed his glasses, and tilted his head toward the floor. He reached up
and massaged his temples and then the back of his neck.
Maybe it was from staring at the screen of the smiling Antenna. Maybe it was from too much work and not enough rest. Maybe it was the stress of the job. Whatever it was, a pressure pushed against the back of Mr. Aguirre's eyes.
He hoped it would soon pass because he was experiencing the worst headache of his life.
Strange.”

Does this mean he will eventually become an Antenna himself, he’s being manipulated by Joe (who’s now an Antenna), or is it from a gas leak, like previously happened at Site B? I know I should know the answer but I was hoping to avoid searching back through my kindle and just have one of you lovely people provide me their interpretation.",horrorlit
1712111682.0,Occultation by Laird Barron,"
To start with, I'm gonna say that Laird Barron is probably one of the best horror writers of the modern day and I'm very eager to consume everything else he's written. This collection of short stories was absolutely incredible. I find that Barron's way of crafting plots and building characters is rather roundabout and hypnotizing, which is part of the allure. He clearly takes from a wide variety of influences, from Lovecraft to Bierce to LeFanu, references to whom he makes in many of his stories, along with film references, revealing his erudition and obsession with the horror genre, and if anyone knows me they know I'm a sucker for intertextuality and Easter eggs. I'm gonna go ahead and review each short story one by one. 

1) The Forest: I thought it interesting that Barron started off this collection with what I felt to be his second weakest story. The Forest is by no means bad, but maybe just not my cup of tea, leaning more towards sci-fi than horror. I will say that it had a very filmic feel to it, almost Cronenberg, veering into body horror moreso than true science fiction. It does give you a feel for how Barron writes, his baroque and twisted imagery, his way of skillfully revealing character development rather than just handing it to you, and his tendency to end stories with a metaphor that makes sense thematically but can be confusing if you aren't used to it. Overall a good story. 


2) Occultation: This is what I would call his weakest story in the book. Occultation is more of a sketch than a full on story, which is in contrast to the rest of this book. It's a small piece of prose-poetry that is interesting but nothing more than that. I thought I was being set up for 400 pages that I wouldn't really enjoy more than sporadically, but luckily this turned out not to be the case. 


3) The Lagerstatte: Now this is what I'm talking about. The Lagerstatte is an absolutely incredible story and should be taught to people trying to learn creative writing for its wonderful use of imagery and relentless tone. This story has a much more depressive atmosphere than the rest, which is necessitated by the mental state of the main character, who is under the spell of psychological illness. Her desperation at reaching out for a solution that any level headed person would dismiss as bunk and then the fragmentation of the storyline as her mental state worsens is absolutely phenomenal storytelling. The whole premise is creepy and Barron's way of telling the story is even creepier. 10/10.


4)  Mysterium Tremendum: A very solid story, better than average although not quite as good as the towering one before it. This one has one of my favorite plot devices however, in which a mysterious (and possibly satanic) book found in an old bookstore leads our main characters on a little road trip. It's nice to see gay characters treated completely even-handedly, not as a simple plot device, while still recognizing the realities they faced. The plot here was a bit winding and I found the end a slight letdown after the peak of the plot was overcome, but the peak was extremely good. A nice story, maybe a 7.5.


5) Catch Hell: Dumb title, best story. If The Lagerstatte was a 10, this is an 11. The plot is perfectly suited towards me, showing that Barron can also make a foray into the Gothic, with the setting being a large, creepy mansion in an isolated setting, and the plot being satanic in nature. I don't want to give the whole thing away but the plot is mostly based on a truly iconic horror film, with this one having a delightful twist at the end. I would give this a rating that reflects it as being not only the best in this collection but one of the best modern horror shorts ever written. For me, it surpassed anything by Thomas Ligotti and made me wonder if Laird Barron might not actually be best horror writer of today. That judgements will have to be withheld for now. 


6) Strappado: Less geared towards my personal tastes but a good short story nonetheless. I don't have much to say about this one other than that it was solid, well written, and has another of his metaphorical endings that can be confusing. 7/10.


7) The Broadsword: The plot set up a good story but unfortunately here Barron let us down a bit with the imagery that he had used so skillfully elsewhere. Don't get me wrong, this is still a very good story, but he tended to make more use of common horror images found in film here, which seemed a bit below his level. Nonetheless, it was a nice piece of Lovecraftian horror, and one where the plot is actually the main focus, and so it evened out in the end to be around the same level as the story before it. Truly creepy. 


8) --30--: While this one feels filmic as well, it's in a better way; 30 is like an unhinged 70s horror movie. The plot is revealed piece by piece, making it hard to get a bearing on what's happening at first, but once it gets going it really gets going. This one maybe tries to do a bit too much at once, marrying sci-fi with satanic horror, Lovecraft, and Wes Craven all at once, but it actually succeeds. The plot here is stuffed to the brim, and it truly creates an atmosphere of unraveling and madness. The last act is truly insane. This is wonderful story that really skeeved me out. 


9) Six six six: nice little thriller to end things off. If the story before is a 70s film this one would be early 80s, a bit cheesy but nonetheless entertaining. It really makes you think the story is going in one direction before pulling a complete 180, I'm still not sure how I feel about the ending. One of the weaker stories but I do love the Gothic setting. 


Overall, I am greatly intrigued by this collection of horror stories and already find myself in the camp of saying that Barron is the savior of 21st century horror. Better than Clive Barker by far and at least on the same level as Ligotti, Barron takes influences from a lot more horror than Ligotti does (he being a strict Lovecraftian) and it shows greatly in the stories, even beyond the intertextuality. Barron can be tonally diverse and explore different types of plots, all without losing that voice that makes him who he is. In that way, I'd liken him to Robert Bloch, although he certainly much more unrelenting in his violence and terror, without Bloch's fun sense of humor and camp. 

Overall, I'd say that this collection of short stories is incredible, the great ones making up for the lesser ones, and that it will drive me and anyone else who reads it to pursue his work indefatigably to the very end. Highly recommend.

1712093819.0,I met Nathan Ballingrud. He sends his love to this subreddit!,"I know many of you enjoy Nathan Ballingrud’s work as much as I do.  I consider him to be one of the finest horror writers around today. So you cannot imagine how excited I was to meet the man.

Here’s the story.

Two weeks ago, my husband surprised me by reaching out to Nathan on social media. Nathan very graciously agreed to meet us when we came to visit Asheville. We met at a local brewery and spent an hour talking about all things literature. I can’t emphasize enough how kind, down-to-earth, empathetic and brilliant Nathan is in person. His mind is like an encyclopedia of literature, and he has such a genuine passion for the craft of writing. Nathan gave me advice for my own writing. And rest assured, I let Nathan know that his prose and his narrative voice are cutting and beautiful, and that his stories are pushing the boundaries of what horror can do for literature.

Nathan was surprised and touched to learn that he has a devoted fanbase on this subreddit!  He sends all of you his love. He told me if there’s enough interest, he would be game for an AMA—maybe in the fall, around the publication date of “Crypt of the Moon Spider."" (I have no idea what’s involved in arranging an AMA…. but if we can’t swing that, maybe we can garner a list of questions to send him instead.)

I know some of you are curious about his upcoming work.  I want to be careful to let Nathan describe his own projects in his own time, BUT I want to share a few exciting things with you.

1. We haven’t read the last of the Hell’s mythos from “Wounds.” Nathan is working on a project set inside that same world—but his priority right now is to focus on his upcoming lunar novellas.
2. That upcoming novella, “Crypt of the Moon Spider,” will certainly be darker and more horror-oriented than his last novel, “The Strange.”
3. I asked Nathan if he’s thought about optioning “The Butcher’s Table” (his most popular work) for a movie or a series. He loves the idea. But the story would need a serious budget or studio behind it. If anyone has any idea how to raise awareness for a project like this—please message me.  Maybe we can work some reddit magic!

Finally, if you’ve ever enjoyed Nathan’s work, or you want to send him some love, please feel free to post below. Let’s give Mr. Ballingrud a very warm welcome to the community.  I’ll make sure he gets a link to this thread!

Bio:

If you aren’t familiar with Nathan Ballingrud, his collection “North American Lake Monsters” won the Shirley Jackson Award and was made into the TV series “Monsterland .”  His fantasy-horror collection “Wounds” is a runaway favorite on this subreddit, featuring the popular pirate-hellscape novella “The Butcher’s Table.”  His most recent novel, “The Strange,” switches genres into a Martian western, set in an alternative history era on Mars.

This August 28th, his newest novella “Crypt of the Moon Spider” will be available. It is the first of several “dark and dreamy lunar gothics.”  You can pre-order it here:

1712092853.0,What are some good books that involve an incomprehensible horror or strangeness that isn't Lovecraft?,"I'm looking for books that center around something horrifying or strange that is difficult or even impossible to imagine.

Lovecraftian would be an appropriate way of describing this but it doesn't necessarily have to be that spooky. 

A great example of this would be Annihilation. Other books I've enjoyed along these lines are Library at Mount Char, John Dies at the End, and Blackwater by Michael McDowell. ",horrorlit

1712079600.0,Horror novels where the town comes to life,"Hello all, 

First just wanted to say thanks to this community. I love getting all the recommendations and my list is a mile long, and I love it.

I for some reason, have read just about every SK novel, but managed to skip over Salem's Lot for some reason. I'm not the biggest vampire fan, but I love how he brings the town to life how only he can. You get a sense of the town, and you can see Derry coming together in IT later.

My ask is for book recommendations where the whole town really comes to life and paints a picture of whatever negative element is going to disrupt this town later in the novel. Outside of SK, I'm open to anything.

1712078331.0,What do you think is the best entry for Stephen King?,"Assume someone has never read any of King’s work. What’s the best single entry point in your opinion and why? 

My vote is for either the Stand or Different Seasons. My personal entry point was the Stand and it got me immediately hooked, but I was primarily a fantasy and sci fi reader with a penchant for unique world building, sprawling storylines and challenging plots. 

For someone less interested in such expansive novels I think Different Seasons is the best option. It’s a fantastic collection and really gives you a sense of Kings strengths and style, plus it isn’t as horror centric as much of his other work.",horrorlit

So when I heard that for one of my college classes I was going to read one ""with a similar vibe"" by the Earthsea author, I was not too thrilled. But oh my god was I wrong, as this short story is life-changing in my opinion, and beat out ""Story of your life"" by Ted Chiang (technically a novella and not really horror) as my favorite short story of all time.

1712061295.0,Dark Harvest Book vs Movie,"I just finished reading Dark Harvest and I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Even short as it is I love how primal, raw, and smart the protagonists and antagonists are, and how the cycle of abuse and curse continues and comes to an end.

So I wanted to watch the movie to compare. The first half got me not gonna lie. I got why for the movie they changed how October Boy was created, makes it more jarring and artistic than letting a pumpkin grow in clothes. They change Pete into Jim's younger brother Ritchie so the movie can have the brother family angle. And I like how they show the different reactions to teens forced to do the run. 

The one iffy change I was on the fence about was Sawtooth Jack, as he's called in the movie. I got why they wanted to make him into a murder machine for the creature feature aspect and more entertaining deaths, but it loses the fact he was just as much as a victim as they were trying to keep whatever much of humanity he had left to survive the deadly gauntlet. So I was begrudgingly accepting it. 

Then the ending happened and it sucked. The book was short yes but it kept it at a beautiful and satisfying ending of the curse is complete. The Town is destroyed and it felt so justified once you get the whole story. Like cleansing sin. 

The movie tho, man they missed something special. Jack loses. He doesn't reach the church in time, he gets Ritchie to shoot him, marking him the next curse victim. And when he tries to fight and get out of it, the Guild manages to kill him and bury him in the grave anyway. Like, why do this? The dad literally one year later after losing both sons revives Ritchie as Sawtooth Jack and tells him to ""burn it all down"" and the movie just ends. How was any of that satisfying when the cycle is still happening and we somehow Don't see Ritchie's vengeance on the town? The book literally had the town light in a fireball already there, and the movie ignores it because I guess it wasn't depressing enough. 

Overall for me, I like some changes they did and style choices, not all, but man that ending killed any redemption it could've had. 

Anyone else seen this movie? What are your thoughts, either as is or vs the book? Ever disappointed by a movie adaptation for other books?

1712060585.0,Tampa by Alissa Nutting,"Tagged NSFW for the book topic. I have been reading horror for a long time. As with movies, horror novels have never made me feel anything. I grew up through 4chan's popularity and like a lot of people, saw the random threads of beheadings on the b board and whatnot. Never have I ever felt so much as a stomach twist. This was different. It's a story from someone who had went to high school with a female pedophile school teacher. This teacher received 4 years probation, a slap on the wrist compared to what she would have received if she hadn't been a woman and also a woman with good looks. This book shook me. It is written with visceral detail, and comes across dramatic for the sake of drawing attention to female pedophiles. But after seeing the interview of whom this book was based upon, I can say wholeheartedly that the level of callous and degeneracy shown by this character is well within the realm of normalcy for her real life equivalent. I could one hundred percent see this book as an alternative timeline in which this character's real life counterpart Debra Lefave had committed every vile action. The depravity and pure evil of it all is enough that I will be retiring from reading for some time. I really recommend this if you want to read something that will make you feel a sense of impending doom, or if you are a parent and want to feel more educated on the mindsets of these dispicable monsters that often hide in plain sight. This book is honestly changing",horrorlit
1712051098.0,All The Fiends Of Hell by Adam Nevill has been released today,"A lot of his novels have been criticised in part because he can sometimes struggle to land the endings. I don't think these criticisms are without merit, although for the most part I enjoy his work despite this (House of Small Shadows was a chore imo). However his last 2 novels have been brilliantly paced and consistent from beginning to end, perhaps in part because they've been shorter with less filler.

With this in mind, I'm incredibly excited to read this post-apocalyptic story. Especially after he did the pre-apocalypse so well with Lost Girl (my favourite Nevill novel).

What are your thoughts on this release?

As a side note, it's a good month for horror as CJ Tudor's new novel releases in about 2 weeks.",horrorlit
1712048888.0,Brief review: Nevill's No One Gets Out Alive,"I appreciated the stitching together of a (largely) realistic thriller onto a ghost story onto a substrate of juicy weird-fiction folk horror.  Commenters here often critique Nevill for abrupt changes in tone, pacing, or perceived quality of story over the course of his novels, I think generally rather fairly.  Interestingly, I think he makes such a tonal shift work to make the story stronger or at least more memorable in this piece.

&#x200B;

I found the atmosphere and visuals satisfyingly evocative.  Both the interior emotional life of the viewpoint character and the exteriors such as appearance of antagonists and the setting of the boarding house were vividly crafted.  For a small, claustrophobic, and narrowly-circumscribed story, Nevill gets a lot of bang from attention to grotesque detail.

&#x200B;

The pacing was peculiar, maybe deliberately so.  The first half of the novel was almost painfully deliberate and really even repetitive, so much so that I had a hard time maintaining interest.  Then, abruptly, when the first critical plot pivot drops, the story suddenly accelerates and maintains that intensity to the very end.   The denouement is more of a whimper than a bang, but it feels appropriate and organic.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, Nevill does his best work with the palette of folk horror.  *The Ritual*, *The Reddening*, and  *Cunning Folk* all feature some of his best and most memorable writing when he's engaging with the tropes of folk horror, and at times I think he finds a common thread between folk horror and cosmic horror that is even more striking.  In *No One Gets Out Alive*,  there's a bit of backbone of folk horror notes to create a feeling of worldbuilding and depth, but I would have liked more.

&#x200B;

So, in summary:  A slow burn to start and the frequently found first-half-versus-second-half common to several of Nevill's pieces.  A fully realized, immersive tour into a truly hellish setting and circumstance.  The urgency and envelopment of the second portion of the novel are worth the setup, and the visuals (and olfactories!) will live a little longer in the memory than many novels can provide.",horrorlit

Nell and Theo go on a walk at night and somehow end up running into a family picnic where Theo sees something so horrible it almost drives her mad. What are everyone’s theories?! What did she see? Was the family an echo of one of the families who had passed through the house? A warped version of a family memory from Theo? Just another trick of the house? Excerpt below: 

The path led them to its destined end and died beneath their feet. Eleanor and Theodora looked into a garden, their eyes blinded with the light of sun and rich color; incredibly, there was a picnic party on the grass in the garden. They could hear the laughter of the children and the affectionate, amused voices of the mother and father; the grass was richly, thickly green, the flowers were colored red and orange and yellow, the sky was blue and gold, and one child wore a scarlet jumper and raised its voice again in laughter, tumbling after a puppy over the grass. There was a checked tablecloth spread out, and, smiling, the mother leaned over to take up a plate of bright fruit; then Theodora screamed. “Don’t look back,” she cried out in a voice high with fear, “don’t look back—don’t look—run!”",horrorlit

It's such a quick, engaging read. I generally stay away from dystopian novels because I think the genre is trite, but the concept of this one had me hooked. 

Above anything , I think *Tender* accomplishes the most important thing that any horror book can and the reason I am (we are?) obsessed with the genre. The novel leaves you with a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach. A combination of disgust, incredulousness, fascination, guilt, and a sense of dread. It also leaves you with a sense of intrigue, aw and perhaps a sick sense of pleasure.

It's the first book in awhile that really reminds me of Edmund Burke's concept of the sublime and true terror that leaves you stunned, appreciative and difficult to go back to normal life.

In the order that I read them this year up until the end of March:

***

### [The Wolf's Hour](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11551.The_Wolf_s_Hour) - Robert McCammon

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐½

This one was sitting in my TBR for a long time, intimidating me in its thickness. I wasn't sure how well I could handle a story about a werewolf superspy. As it turned out, I loved it. McCammon split the narrative into two timelines which show the MC being turned into a wolf and then growing into his strength, while the other takes place during WW2 as he seeks to thwart a Nazi ploy that would secure the war for them.

*Recommended for: Lovers of werewolves and/or lovers of historical WW2 horror*

****

### [The Peabody-Ozymandias Traveling Circus and Oddity Emporium](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289254-the-peabody-ozymandias-traveling-circus-and-oddity-emporium) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐

Last year I went on a massive [F Paul Wilson](https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/187gamx/f_paul_wilsons_adversary_cycle_repairman_jack/) binge and read through a large portion of his work. This is a little extension to his ""Secret History of the World"" mythos. It was a fun story, but I'm not sure how easily it'd be approachable for people without this context.

*Recommended for: Mainly FPW fans, but also people seeking freakshow style cosmic horror*

***

### [Dead Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/988783.Dead_Sea) - Tim Curran

### ⭐⭐⭐

You know all those [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/14wmdys/ultimate_compendium_of_oceanicunderwater_request/) where people ask for oceanic cosmic horror? Well this is **exactly** the book they're asking for. I enjoyed it, but the reason it doesn't score higher is because it was just so needlessly long and became a bit of a slog to get through.

*Recommended for: Oceanic and cosmic horror lovers*

***

### [Cold City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13539179-cold-city) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

The start of a prequel trilogy for FPW's iconic Repairman Jack character. While Jack's later escapades are supernatural and rise to the level of universal cosmic horror, these ones are more grounded in things like mob warfare, terrorism, and child trafficking. This notwithstanding, I still really enjoyed it.

*Recommended for: People who've read Repairman Jack or people who really like urban thrillers*

***

### [Trouble With Lichen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91097.Trouble_with_Lichen) - John Wyndham

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐½

I *love* John Wyndham and stand by the claim that he's the most underappreciated author in horror literature. He's the father of apocalyptic fiction and one of the early voices in dystopian fiction. What's more, his prose is extremely approachable even by modern standards, unlike most writing prior to ~1970 that tends to be super dry. Trouble With Lichen is an excellent exploration of the dystopia that would occur if technology was discovered that could lengthen human life into the centuries, however production was severely limited. 

*Recommended for: Lovers of dystopian fiction*

***

### [Dark City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16163783-dark-city) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐½

Book two in the Early Repairman Jack trilogy. More of the same from the first book, more of Jack becoming Jack.

*Recommended for: People who've read Repairman Jack or people who really like urban thrillers*

***

### [The Dark Half](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11597.The_Dark_Half) - Stephen King

### ⭐⭐

I've long said to people that King's golden era was pre-1990 and that everything he'd written during this time was a guaranteed banger. The Dark Half is the exception. This book kind of sucked. It's an allegory to King being outed as Bachman. The plot is around an author whose penname manifests as a poltergeist and starts going on a rampage. While King isn't traditionally known for his endings, this one takes on a whole new level of bad.

*Recommended for: Diehard King fans who just need to read everything he's written, just read most of his other stuff first*

***

### [Fear City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518868-fear-city) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Conclusion to the Early Repairman Jack trilogy. More of the same, building up to Jack's role in thwarting the real-life terrorist attacks that occurred in New York in the 90s.

*Recommended for: People who've read Repairman Jack or people who really like urban thrillers*

***

### [Ticktock](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/959409.Ticktock) - Dean Koontz

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

I've read a lot of Koontz in the past and my experience with him is how hit-or-miss he is. This one had been in my pile for a long time and I kind of had to force myself to read it, but in the end I enjoyed it quite a lot. One of his better works. Starts with a killer doll that hunts the main character and escalates from there in increasingly fun and wacky ways. 

*Recommended for: Campy as hell supernatural horror from the class of 80s horror juggernauts*

***

### [Fix](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51799078-fix) - JA Konrath, Ann Voss Peterson, F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐

Konrath and Peterson write a cheesy spy series called Codename Chandler. This book is part of that world, but it crosses over with Wilson's Repairman Jack character which is why I read it. It was a pretty fun (and I repeat, cheesy) story, but it's not something I'd have read if not for Jack's involvement.

*Recommended for: Cheesy spy thrillers*

***

### [Allhallows Eve](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145160.Allhallow_s_Eve) - Richard Laymon

### ⭐⭐

Another that had been in my TBR for a long time and another author that's very hit-or-miss. It was a very easy read that followed Laymon's usual tropes of stupid, unlikeable, horny characters. But the conclusion was just... crap... Like it built up for 249 pages and then ended abruptly in the 250th. 

*Recommended for: Cheesy slasher fans*

***

### [Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33507.Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea) - Jules Verne

### ⭐⭐½

More sci-fi/adventure, but still a fun read. Similar to my comment about John Wyndham, it's amazing how easy to read Jules Verne is considering how long ago it was written. Not only that, but considering it was translated too. Reads almost modern, and it's amazing how much of a futurist Verne was and how much he actually got right that was mere sci-fi at the time. Biggest issue with this though, is that there's essentially no plot. Stuff just happens until it stops happening. No conflict, no resolution, just stuff.

*Recommended for: Fans of the classics, fans of sci-fi and adventure*

***

### [Cabal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/103035.Cabal) - Clive Barker

### ½

Ironically, it was Barker that got me back into reading a few years back with his Abarat series. It was just such a chill and easy read. But since then, I've tried two others by him (Imajica and Cabal) and DNF'd both of them for the same reasons. Here in Cabal the progression of events and character actions is just so nonsensical that I don't know how I'm supposed to take them seriously, much less enjoy them. I typed up a fair bit more here which I ended up deleting because I was fairly harshly critical of the ""plot"", best to leave it unsaid.

*Recommended for: Nobody really, though if you must, then fans of second-world fantasy who can handle ridiculous contrivances*

***

### [Midnight Mass](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219417.Midnight_Mass) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

It's a great testament to FPW that he kept me wrapped up for thirty-something books in his connected universe before I made it to this standalone masterpiece. It was basically written for me and my tastes. Evil vampires combined with the apocalypse? Yes please. Don't be confused to think it has anything to do with the show either, despite the show borrowing heavily from it (vampires, strong religious plot, and many of the same character archetypes).

*Recommended for: Vampire lovers, apocalypse lovers, fans of religious themes*

***

### [Feed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7094569-feed) - Mira Grant

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

I'm openly not the biggest zombie fan, but I have liked Mira Grant in the past and this one was one of the more unique takes on the genre. It's set 25 years after the zombie apocalypse, but now they've got it tentatively under control and are trying to go about their lives in a zombie world. Like The Walking Dead, everybody is infected, so zombies are just a way of life in the world. It follows journalises who are trailing a presidential campaign and who uncover a big government conspiracy in the process.

*Recommended for: Zombie fans, dystopian and post-apocalyptic fans*

***

### [Deadline](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8429687-deadline) - Mira Grant

### ⭐⭐½

Book two of Mira Grant's Newsflesh trilogy. This one suffers in much the same way that the second book of her Parasitology trilogy did. It was basically just filler to pad out a trilogy. Same plot and themes as above.

*Recommended for: As above*

***

### [Blackout](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11806716-blackout) - Mira Grant

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Conclusion to the Newsflesh trilogy and a return to form after the disappointing second entry.

*Recommended for: As above*

***

### [Empire of the Damned](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126918599-empire-of-the-damned) - Jay Kristoff

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Sequel to his Empire of the Vampire from a couple of years ago which I loved. I really enjoyed this one too, but it did have a couple of things with the narrative style that got on my nerves. Still looking forward to the finale though.

*Recommended for: Vampire lovers and people seeking high fantasy horror*

***

### [The Fifth Harmonic](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6139032-the-fifth-harmonic) - F Paul Wilson

### ⭐⭐⭐

This was a curious little novel. MC is a doctor who comes down with aggressive cancer and seeks alternative treatment. Ends up on a spiritual adventure through Central America doing all sorts of new agey stuff. It was a perfectly middling book. Didn't love it, but the pages kept turning.

*Recommended for: People into spiritual healing and alternative medicine with a side of adventure/fantasy*

***

### [Sinkhole](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50029116-sinkhole) - April A Taylor

### ⭐⭐½

Been really enjoying indie authors lately and I read this whole short book in a day. Really cool concept where the Earth essentially revolts against humanity with natural disasters and animals becoming bloodthirsty. This said, I feel like the author didn't know where to go with it, because the ending was terrible.

*Recommended for: Apocalyptic lovers and eco-horror lovers*

***

### [Intercepts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45868683-intercepts) - TJ Payne

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Another indie author, another great book. This time I loved it all the way through and I read this one in only a couple of days too. The concept has been done before, think Minority Report or The Institute where people are used as conduits for espionage, but this one had a really fun take on things from there which I won't spoil further. Seriously though, anyone on the fence with indie authors needs to give them a shot because I'm finding so much great stuff.

*Recommended for: Human experimentation horror fans*

***

### [The Watchers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58321103-the-watchers) - AM Shine

### ⛔

Okay so anyone who's followed my posts probably knows by now that I'm very forgiving of bad writing because I consider the story to hold 99% of the importance in a... story... with the writing simply the delivery mechanism. This one though... the writing made me DNF within 50 pages. And within those 50 pages I probably suffered through 200+ similes that served no purpose. It felt like a student trying to extend their word count for an assignment. Just couldn't do it.

*Recommended for: masochistic school teachers*

That's me for Q1 of 2024, it's been a very productive first few months on the reading front! I almost even fit one more in here which is [**Exhumed**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208579691-exhumed) by **SJ Patrick**. The author kindly provided me an ARC and I'm about 3/4 of the way through and loving it. Really great take on vampires. Will review it in my next post when I'm finished.

1711940392.0,How do I read anything outside of horror?,"(Edit TLDR: Tired of horror, fantasy and scifi. I just want something \*fictional\* with fairly low stakes about people in normal settings and not about death. like just normal people. idk)

I only ever read fantasy and horror. Like 1 book every two days. Yesterday was Holly by Stephen King. Before that was the Troop by Nick Cutter. Before that was Pillars of the Earth. They're great, accessible and the stakes are high. But it's making me tired. So much death.

I want to branch out and read other genres. But I don't know where to start. Do you got any recommendations that aren't horror or fantasy? Like something modern about a fictional character's life.

Is it the long form novel, or an author demonstrating a diverse range of stories and talents in one collection? 

I’m going with the short story collection. 

It gives authors less time to screw up a story, and if they tank it you are less invested emotionally and in time spent. Reading collections of short stories makes me feel pretty accomplished. 

2/3 of my favorite authors excel in the short form (Brian Evenson and Laird Barron). 

As a metric, I’ve finished 11 books this year. 7 were short story collections, 2 were novellas, and 2 were novels. Most of the stuff in my TBR that I am most excited about are collections, and I seem to keep moving them to the top of the pile.

1711875350.0,My beef with Michael McDowell's Blackwater Saga,"This post won't contain any spoilers beyond themes and genre.

Michael McDowell's Blackwater Saga was published in 6 short volumes (each <200 pages); its narrative spanning the years 1919 to the late 1960s in Perdido, Alabama.

The saga is regularly described as both horror and southern gothic. There's no need to define horror to this audience, but Gothic as a genre tends to deal with the anxiety and anticipation around archaic power structures fading away, whether religious (Lewis' The Monk or Radcliffe's The Italian), Feudal (The Castle of Otranto or the Mystery of Udolpho), or, in the case of Southern Gothic, slave-economy, which is often explored with post-civil war families decaying in the wake of abolition and the waning cotton trade (the decrepit plantation houses of Faulkner, or the painful integration of Flannery O'Connor).

Blackwater is not Southern Gothic. In fact, for first 90% of the novel has the Caskey's going from strength to strength, success to success, regardless of post slavery economics, two world wars, a great depression, and civil rights movements. Nothing touches them, and without going into spoilers, the ending does not set up a grand Fall, nor an accountability for their social position.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say it has an offensively revisionist view of race, sexuality, and gender norms, given the time period it's set it. It seems nearly everbody is fine with being whoever they want to be and who they want to be with, and in the 50 year span of the saga, the black servant family is never raised as a question of ethics or evolves in any way.  Every generation is just so gosh darn eager to serve the Caskey's, coz they good folks.

On a line-by-line basis the saga is competently written; I wouldnt have finished it otherwise. The characters are each unique, but the 3rd person omniscient narration is more detached than usual, and entire years are breezed over in the same historical prose as the actual action, and makes investment in the drama difficult to achieve. As for the horror elements...? I'm personally convinced that they were a late addition to the drafting of the saga and that the series would have been improved by more ambiguity; as it is, the horror elements pop up occasionally like a jack in the box, disappear, and barely affect the continued plot.

I can't say that I *hated* it; as mentioned before, I wouldn't have read a book this long, over 3 months, if that were so. But every element of it was so neutered and undercooked that by the ending, I was pretty underwhelmed by what McDowell had to say about 50 years of Alabama society, where his foreword denoted that his aim was to ""describe the people as they *are*"".

A disappointment, to be sure, given my love of both Horror and Southern Gothic.

1711857238.0,Problems with the Horror Genre?,"We all love horror here, definitely no doubt about that, but that doesn't mean there's no criticism to be had. I think as horror lovers, we're some of the best people *to* criticize the genre, really. We know what makes horror *horror*, and in turn, we understand the nuances of the genre better than non-readers of horror. This also means we would understand the whys of what things fall flat. Of course, this is all subjective anyway, but there are popular and unpopular trends. This is what I'm curious about - what sorts of things have you noticed as trends in horror that you don't enjoy or have active problems with?

I'll be honest, the main reason I'm writing this post is to rant about my gripes with ableism in the genre. I read a book recently that I found really tense, but the underlying ableism of the way the antagonist was described really took me out of it. I'm disabled myself - though not physically - so it really irks me when horror writers fall back on those tropes because they're not realistic a lot of the time, and they tend to paint people with disabilities as monsters, which feels really shitty. The book I read in particular had the antagonist be physically disabled, and described him as ""mangled"" and ""disfigured"" or ""malformed"". It felt like the author was trying to invoke feelings of disgust in me because of the character's physical disabilities instead of the heinous shit he did (although they try to disgust you that way too, I just thought the disability part was needlessly pronounced). The writer also thought it'd be fun to include the trope of the character with psychosis/schizophrenia being ""dangerous"", which I just feel like does more harm than good, even if that made the narrator more unreliable, which I find engaging. If they'd found another way to make the narrator unreliable, I'd have less of a gripe about it. I just find it to be a shame because disregarding these elements, I did actually enjoy the book.

While this isn't a problem unique to horror (I've found thrillers are bad for it too), I do find it more pronounced than in other genres. I'm sure there are plenty of books that do it right, and plenty of horror written by disabled people themselves, but I don't find that to be the case the majority of the time. Anything like this for you guys? Or if you'd like to expand on or disagree with my point, be my guest! I would love to hear other opinions.",horrorlit

1711824379.0,Briardark - A stunning debut that reads like Missing411 meets Twilight Zone,"Howdy folks! Long time lurker, first time poster -- this novel is too good not to gush about.

**Elevator pitch**: Ever go down one of those r/AskReddit rabbit holes with a subjects like, ""What's your true story Twilight Zone moment?"" or ""Tell me about your favorite unsolved, real-world mystery"" ? (If not, [you should](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/95bsre/seriouseerie_towns_disappearing_diners_and_creepy/).) S.A. Harian's *Briardark* is a beautifully-written, novel-length journey down just that sort of rabbit hole.

Please, allow me to convince you.

\----

**Some housekeeping notes**:

Some discussion here has already questioned whether this counts as ""horror"" (vs. paranormal mystery). In my opinion, horror has three components: 

(a) It does not need to be scary, but it does need to horrify;

(b) It is an allegory, or else it contains allegory;

(c) It is fundamentally tension-driven (in the same way that soul music is fundamentally rhythm-driven, as opposed to melody or harmony driven.)

*Briardark* meets all those criteria. It is also creepy with some truly disturbing moments, even if there's little in the way of the creeping-dread feel one would expect from, say, *'Salem's Lot*.

\----

**Spoiler-Free Review**

*Briardark* begins with a flashback (or is it?) to the disappearance of five hikers in a poorly-charted wilderness area somewhere in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. Several years later, a science team from CalTech hikes into the same wilderness area on a climate study of a receding glacier.

The weirdness builds gradually from here. Satellite phones that can't make calls, trails that appear and disappear overnight, plants that shouldn't be there... Atmospherically, this plays out like *Annihilation*, but without the constraint of being told through a journal.

Scene cut. New character -- an IT professional at Oregon State University is tasked with purging data from a collection of hard-drives when he stumbles across an audio recording of an expedition to the depths of the Sierra Nevada mountains. The speaker mentions the death of a colleague, a colleague who, in the other narrative frame, is still very much alive...

These three narrative threads dance around one another in such a way that the reader can't quite tell what happened when. And by the time you start to figure out how all these pieces fit together -- well, I'd rather not spoil it :)

\----

**Comparisons**

Personally, the way I discover new stories is by looking for what is similar to stories I've already enjoyed. Some notable comparisons to other stories I rate 5/5 :

&#x200B;

|Story in comparison|Similarities|Differences|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fringe (TV Show)|Tone (alternatingly light and dramatic -- full enough to capture the wide range of human experience), intrigue, vaguely mystical science fiction, ""is there some deeper plot beneath this?""|No government conspiracies; a little more fantastical than science fictional.|
|Annihilation (Jeff Vandermeer)|Creepy wilderness shit; invisible barriers separating ""our world"" from the creepy wilderness shit; vaguely apocalyptic undertone; vaguely cli-fi.|Characters in Briardark are more like people you know in your actual life, as opposed to the traumatized plot-kites Jeff writes. |
|The Fisherman (John Langan)|Otherworldly eldritch mystery. Heavy themes of unresolved grief, loss, and mental health.|Briardark is way ""lighter."" The Fisherman reads like it's Literary Fiction, and carries the same somberness. The darkness in The Fisherman is therefore much more personal and much more menacing. |
|The Hollow Places (T Kingfisher)|A world behind a veil. Normal people from normal, relatable lives struggling to comprehend the horrors they've stumbled into.|Briardark is much darker, and the stakes are much higher. The characters really marinate in the horror of the world they're stuck in, whereas Kingfisher characters are given the space to still worry about phone calls from their nagging ex, etc.|

&#x200B;

\----

**Some Potential Icks**

Everyone has their own icks (things that make a story ""not work"" for them.) This story really worked for me, but the things I found that you might not like:

\- It's very contemporary. The ""background"" story concerning the disappearing hikers is represented through a mixture of cutaways to chapters from a book about their disappearance, references to one of the disappeared's YouTube channels, and occasionally also to reddit posts about said mystery. (All fictional, of course.) Some folks don't want to read fake reddit threads in their eldritch mystery novels, and that's fair.

\- The characters are more well-rounded and relatable, but their agency is somewhat constrained. This is a complaint I often see. It didn't bother me, personally, because how much agency would a geomorphology professor have if they suddenly found themselves in a world like Stranger Things' ""Upside Down""? I'd shit myself and not know what to do, personally.

\----

**Checklist Items**

&#x200B;

|Content Warnings|Mental health (insanity). Bugs. Death, somewhat graphic but not tediously so. Religious overtones (very light -- references to a cult, a character who left a fundamentalist faith). |
|:-|:-|
|Representation|Cast is \~60% female. Multiple queer characters (no trans or nonbinary characters, though the author uses she/they pronouns, so I don't think this is an intentional omission, and it's a small cast anyway.) Racially diverse, but race isn't an important dimension to the characters' arcs/backgrounds. |
|Bechdell Test|Passes with flying colors. The most developed relationship is between two women leading a science team.|
|Resolved or cliffhangered?|Very much cliffhangered. But the next novel is in progress, and the author posts revision status updates on their IG.|

1711822659.0,Daisy Darker - Alice Feeney,"After reading/really enjoying Rock Paper Scissors, I was told by many that Daisy Darker was their favorite by Feeney so I had to check it out. 

I immediately caught onto the fact that Daisy was dead while she was telling the story. It was quite obvious due to the lack of acknowledgement and response she received from her family. I also kept thinking, “please don’t be Trixie, please don’t be Trixie” because I’m pretty tired of the unsuspecting child killer trope… and as soon as the agent said he would read a book about her if she wrote one, I knew it was the book I was reading lol. 

However, despite all of the accurate predictions I made it kept me invested the entire time and really surprised me! There were far more twists than I foresaw and it was really creative how everything fell together. I still think I like Rock Paper Scissors better tho. ;)

1711811483.0,Monstrilio - Gerardo Sámano Córdova,"Just finished reading Monstrilio this evening and had some thoughts. Spoilers ahead and please excuse any poor formatting and my outpouring of thoughts.

For me, this book reminded me a lot of The Babadook, for its themes of physical manifestations of grief. I also got Pet Semetary vibes. 

In the first part of the book, I found Magos' character to be very interesting and compelling. The way she handled grief entirely differently to her husband, the way she acted coldly but also would play his buttons to try and illicit a reaction. I found it an interesting exploration of the way people (particularly women) can experience grief in different ways, which can come across as offputting to others. Being Aussie, this sort of reminded me at times of the way poor Lindy Chamberlain was vilified by the media for not outwardly expressing her grief. Then if course there is the absolute insanity that is her mutilation of Santiago's corpse and harvesting of his lung.

Jackie sort of reminds me of Jud from Pet Semetary in the way she tells Magos the story of growing someone back from the dead using body parts, but then immediately being like ""oh but you better not do it lol."" I could see no logical reason for her doing this, beyond some sort of Wendigo-style manipulation as Jud was presumably under. Either that or she's just a certified silly goose.

As the story progresses and as character perspectives changed, I feel like certain character elements were lost, diluted, or seemingly evolved into different people entirely. Magos as an artist for me didn't feel like the same person from the start of the book. She is also a genuinely unlikeable character and I struggle to find redeeming qualities.

I enjoyed Lena's character thoroughly and found she was well written. Her motivations to me made sense and I also felt like her reactions were always pretty believable. She certainly felt the most ""real"" to me. 

Joseph to me was a bit of a boring character, however I did enjoy him most during M's Monstrilio phase.

And then there is the monster himself, M! I found this concept to be really interesting. His phases were so novel to me, and I particularly enjoyed his Monstrilio phase. I found him positively adorable but also so bittersweet - especially when he'd have to be locked up or punished for the act of feeding. When he called Joseph ""Papi"" for the first time I wanted to cry, haha.

M is such an interesting take on personified grief to me. Magos first is the one to nurture him and feeds him, like someone holding onto an unhealthy obsession with the past. Others find this harmful, revolting, and it physically causes harm to some. She uses him to lure Joseph back to her despite their marriage breakdown, manipulating their trauma-bond.

M in the latter half of the book is intriguing. He evolves past being a dumb animal and becomes the fully fledged being that he is. Animalistically in tune with his desires and able to scent fear and lust as well as to physically absorb memories from meat including his own lung in the case of Santiago. I mostly see him as an exploration of supressed desires both sexual and violent. I also read him through the lens of being perhaps on the autism spectrum. This might be a slightly shallow or reductionist observation, but I enjoyed how there was little serious injury or death inflicted to female characters, nor was there sexual exploitation of female characters, given its prevalence in the genre.

I found it a little odd that pretty much every single character in this book ends up gay either explicitly or by implication, but then again I have never thought twice when reading a book and everyone is straight! Additionally it would make sense to be more prevalent if that is common amongst your social circle, I guess. This didn't detract from my enjoyment of course, just an observation. 

I absolutely adore the cover art and design of this book, as well as the little Monstrilio drawing on the author info section. 

In summary, I feel there could have been some slightly better character realisation. I enjoyed the prose and pacing of the novel, and also enjoyed the LGBT representation. I didn't get any misogynistic vibes and feel the female characters were mostly written quite well. I will certainly read any other works out forward by the author in future.

For me, this would be a 4.25/5 

I would love to hear other's thoughts!

1. Gage biting Rachel when she's breastfeeding him as they drive upto the house. 

This moment becomes horrific considering that he eventually cannibalizes her at the end. 

2. Gage getting stung by a bee.

1711802687.0,"Cujo, what the hell was that?","I heard King was writing a sequel to Cujo in his upcoming short story collection coming out in May. Since I'd never read it and saw the movie many, many years ago I decided to check it out. It was not what I expected. Here are some of my thoughts.
1. There is this whole sub story about a monster living in the main character's kid's closet. It's not in his imagination, it's real. It comes out and talks shit to the kid or just generally freaks him out. It says it used to be a serial killer cop named Frank Dodd before it died (a villain from The Dead Zone). I found this to be the best part of the book. Creepy-ass unsettling scenes with this thing. It was legit scary. 
2. This book is pretty woke for 1981 (not a bad thing). The 2 main characters are both women. One cheats on her husband and kind of blames him for it. The other is in an abusive marriage. She is trying to find a way to leave her husband with her son without him finding out or possibly killing her. There is a sort of women liberation theme here (once again, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I just didn't expect it).
3. This book is way too long. It would have made an excellent short story. The last half drags even though that's when all of the action happens. The ""trapped in the car scene "" lasts too long and loses it's tension, which was a shame because it could have been incredibly intense. 
4. This book is way, way more sad than scary. There are a lot of parts from Cujo's perspective. You see how rabies changes him and drives him slowly insane. Cujo was a good dog before he got rabies, I found this kind of tragic. And then there is the end. I give King credit for having the balls to write it. 
**Ending Spoiler**
The woman that cheats on her husband 
(Donna) and her 4 year old son (tad) are trapped in the car for several days in the summer heat. This poor kid has seizures from heat stroke and he eventually dies. It's incredibly sad. Donna has a mental breakdown when rescue finally arrives. It's all very heartbreaking and then boom, the book is over. I don't know how to feel about it. Part of me likes it because it's not a ""saved at the last seconds everything will be alright"" Hollywood ending. But, yikes, real bleak and tragic. Hard to like that kind of ending. 

Cujo surprised me. A lot of unexpected stuff. I don't think it was a great book, but it wasn't bad either. I'm curious what the sequel will be about. Hopefully the Frank Dodd monster. I feel like there is a lot more story there.",horrorlit

1711789505.0,Horror / Dark Stories Featuring Prominent Overpowered or Powerful Characters,"This feels like something I should ask elsewhere because I'm unsure how prominent this is in horror stories, but I have a preference for this genre so I'm giving it a shot here.

I love stories involving characters that are extremely powerful. I'm the person who likes Mary Sues, though I'm not looking for characters that are loved by all and seen as doing no wrong (unless that's part of the horror). I just find it very interesting when a character has that much power. There's a lot to be said about how they see themselves and how others see them. Their power can make them an enemy, a desired ally, a god, a monster.

I'm specifically looking for stories where these characters or scenes are prominent. So, not a character who shows up once, does something cool, then never comes back. I'm thinking of main characters and supporting characters, including antagonists. I'd also prefer to not have to wait until the very end for something impressive to happen. I am, however, fine with buildups leading to a series of increasing power.

Tropes and themes I LOVE

* Body horror
* Psychological horror
* Surrealism
* Cosmic horror (Please do not suggest me Lovecraft. Aside from other things, I just don't like his writing.)
* Reality warping
* Psychic abilities (specifically telekinesis)
* Warped sense of morality or corruption of morality

What I prefer to avoid

* Historical settings
* Sexual violence, ESPECIALLY against minors
* Heavy bigotry (racism, homophobia, transphobia)

Some examples of stories where prominent characters display extreme power:

* A Light Most Hateful by Hailey Piper
* The Library at Mount Char by Scott Hawkins
* The Dreamer Trilogy by Maggie Stiefvater
* The Scholomance Series by Naomi Novik
* The Locked Tomb Series by Tamsyn Muir
* Allison by Jeff Strand
* Firestarter by Stephen King
* Middlegame by Seanan McGuire
* It's a Good Life by Jerome Bixby
* Hench by Natalie Zina Walschots (It was just one part, but, wow. It made an impact.)
* The Poppy War by R.F. Kuang (I liked the first book, hated the second book, then dropped the series.)

There was a book that interested me that I forgot the name of, where the main character developed psychic abilities that essentially made him a god and went around using that with increasingly warped morality... but the book had so many kinds of bigotry (it was impressive, really) that I had to drop it. If not for that, it would have been perfect for me.

I'm not against comics and manga either. I know those are filled with powerful characters when looking into superpowers and shounen. I struggle to keep up with comics however, so while I'll take those suggestions, I'm less likely to get to them.",horrorlit
1711787022.0,Was anyone shocked by this scene from George R R Martin’s “Fevre Dream”?,"I could stomach lots of things when it comes to horror, but I gotta admit I was shocked by this.

So I picked up “Fevre Dream” thinking “cool a vampire story by the guy behind game of thrones”. Sound interesting alright. So i get to this part of the novel where the main villain kills a baby.

Now I know game of thrones is no stranger to baby deaths, but technically they don’t tend to be very descriptive and are often described “offscreen”.  I wasn’t freaking expecting an entire page dedicated to describing how this baby gets his hand lobbed off, how it just frails about crying in pain and then gets his skull crushed. I was like “WTF” and just sat there visibly stunned. Graphic “Saw” level demise for an infant character was the last thing I expected when reading books.

I was wondering if anyone felt the same way.",horrorlit

My last question was answered so quickly and so successfully, I'm going to present another, which I fear may not be as easy to answer. It is one of my holy grails...

Somewhere back in the '70s (between 1970-and 1977, and probably closest to 1974-1975 +/-2 years) I read a short-short SF/Horror story in one of the little free magazines that we sometimes received in school from Scholastic and possibly other sources.

One day a friend showed me a story in their copy of one of these little magazines (it was more or less digest sized) that I had missed because I was out sick (so this was probably in the winter? it explains why I never had my own copy though). The narrator of the story is a child attending another child's birthday party in the future (at least in the future as perceived from the mid-'70s), and bringing a special gift made in the lab in which his/her father worked (I can't remember with any certainty the gender of either the narrator or the recipient of the gift, though I think the recipient might have been a girl).

The gift is a little box or cube, and a string or cord extends out of a hole on one side of the box. When the recipient of the gift pulls on the string, the string pulls back. A delightful tug-of-war ensues, until suddenly whatever is on the other side of the string pulls so hard the birthday girl(?) is drawn into the hole and disappears inside the box. Possibly followed by screams and/or crunching/eating sounds...

The climactic line of the story was something close to ""I forgot the monster on the other side of the nowhere-hole could pull back.""

I also distinctly remember a rather spoilery illustration of a monster accompanying the story. The image (which appears in blue ink in my memory) was a frontal depiction of a ragged and vicious-looking humanoid monster with a fibrous cord extending from the tip of one of its claws.

I have searched in vain for this story for 40 years, and will be genuinely indebted to anyone who can ID it and/or help me locate a copy. THANK YOU!

After I posted this query here, I shared a version on my Facebook page as well, and several friends stated that they too remembered this story. One of them was able to add the following details, all of which fit my memory:

""The scientist/parent was the child's mother. After a few back and forth pulls on the ""string"" the birthday boy made the mistake of wrapping the string around his hand, then yanking really hard. All the party attendees heard his screams after the birthday boy was pulled into the box. The child [who brought the gift] was subsequently shunned by the other neighborhood parents/children after the incident. In retrospect, an awful story to give to a 10 or 11-year old!""

I read the book and, while I know it is an anti-war story, the idea of being only a conscious mind, trapped inside your own head, is truly horrifying to me. He recounts WWI stories that are also horrible in their own right. I saw the video today for the first time in a while, and it kind of punched me in the feels. 

Ultimately, the book is sad, and full of despair and dread. I recently spent several days sedated on paralytics in the ICU, and I was still somewhat conscious of what was going on around me.

I wasn’t sure what to expect. I wasn’t sure if it would be ghosts, or like haunting, body gore or what. What i found is what i’m calling “real life horror” for lack of knowing a better word. stuff that could actually happen to you. it’s about 200 odd pages and i read it in a day bc once i started it i wanted to piece together the mystery of the main character but when i finished it i felt slighted almost. it took me about an hour of thinking after i finished to decide that i like the book. i like that it doesn’t all wrap up into some perfectly assembled puzzle. in reference to the book the story is like the perfectly written letter for the balloon project. it made perfect sense until the water was spilled on it. that’s pretty much how his memory is. the narrator is unreliable i feel like but i would be too. and the attachment at the end was 🤯

I'll be honest...a lot of the current recommended horror has left me underwhelmed (Edenville DNF, Bunny was unique and highly readable but undercooked, TOGI was absolutely terrific in the first half, lost me in the second, Our Wives Under the Sea seemed to spin its wheels and not get going, The Deep by Alma Katsu was very pretty but didn't pack much of a punch) but I loved ""The Writing Retreat"" by Julia Bartz (more thriller than straight horror), The Sanitarium.

I don't know anyone who has been so scared that this would happen nor have I heard of such occasion, but correct me if I'm wrong. If it's a phenomena I'm unaware of it's still overused and a cheap way to portrait overwhelming fear. 

I first picked this trend from King's novels, which I've read a bunch, but the same happened in Wasp Factory, HEX and also in The Library at Mount Char, which are my most recent reads. Heck, I bought four books and only House of Leaves didn't have someone pee himself, lol.

1711661940.0,I never understood how “Head Full of Ghosts” could be interpreted as paranormal.,"The book seemed so deliberate in portraying everything in a way that could be reasonably explained, and yet I see reviews calling it occult or ghostly. If I recall correctly, Merry herself gives multiple methods in which the “hauntings” could have occurred; nor is her penchant for horror media an indicator that she seriously believes Marjorie was possessed. Even the more “out there” incidents have non-paranormal (if still bizarre) explanations.

To me, “Head Full of Ghosts” reads almost entirely as a book about child exploitation, and not at all one of true demonic possession: Marjorie was extremely mentally unwell (probably suffering from some form of psychosis), and was exploited by her church and corrupt reality TV. Even her parents used her for money— sure, they may have seen it to be in Marjorie and Merry’s benefit, but that’s still essentially what took place.

Either way, I really enjoyed this book, and I love hearing other’s thoughts on it. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

1711661270.0,Male horror authors and sexually assaulting female characters,"Recently I have reignited my passion for reading and found that horror literature, more specifically haunted house/ghost horror, is my favorite. I have been getting increasingly frustrated because many times when I find a book that seems to fit my ideal sub genre, I read the book to find that the biggest “spook” of the story revolves around a woman being penetrated in some perverted way. To name a few examples, a young woman masturbating, a woman penetrating herself with a cross or some other weird object, hyper sexualization, anal penetration, mutilation of breasts, and most recently a statue of Jesus Christ on the cross with a boner falling off the wall and penetrating a woman to death (I wish I was kidding, if you know you know). Seriously , what is wrong with these authors? Do I need to buy only women’s books to get non sexual horror? Jeez.

This is about a pair of researchers who both (separately) discover a medicine that prolongs human life about fivefold, so people can live 300+ years old. Problem is that it's derived from a super rare kind of lichen in China so supply is hard limited.

(Carrie retelling with bi-racial witch) That was the fastest book I've ever read. I wasn't expecting my first horror book read to go that well which makes it more Disappointing when I was reading Misery months later and was bored out of my mind and felt like I had to force myself to read (And I'm still only halfway though it, I'll have to force myself some more.), it was like really bad compared to Carrie in my opinion. I thought since it was the same author I would also like it.

I couldn't feel myself connecting to Paul like I did Carrie and was actively rooting for Annie to either torture him for the rest of his life or kill him. He was just so toxic and sexist. And there's nothing wrong with characters who are bad people (I actually prefer characters who are bad people), but he's not a bad person, he's just a dick without a decently sympathetic backstory to counteract him being boring and being a dickhead.

So what book actually scared you? I want to read something truly creepy and scary. And not just like “oh this book is scary because it’s disgusting.” I do read splatterpunk but I don’t want to be grossed out I want to be scared. 

The last book that actually scared me was The Troop by Nick Cutter. Yea it was gross too.. but the thing that scared me the most was a character named Shelley (iykyk).",horrorlit

1711580674.0,Enjoyable Horror Books?,"I've been getting into horror books and generally they don't scary me, but sometimes they leave me feeling disturbed/gross and I want to avoid those kinds of books. For example Gallows Hill by Darcy Coates was really enjoyable because in the end everything made sense and everything tied up. Also the scary stuff was just supposed to be scary, not f*ed up (like the ending of Hannibal was really messed up and I regret ever reading that book). So basically scary books written to be enjoyable, not to be as disturbing/messed up as possible.
Also preferably not sexual, especially in a way that's central to the plot. Like a lot of authors make horror weirdly sexual imo and it's not my thing.

Thanks!!!",horrorlit
1711579967.0,Thank you to whoever recommended Wounds by Nathan Ballingrud. ,"I recently finished the Books of Blood volumes by Clive Barker (also read Hellbound Heart but haven’t continued) and was looking through my library and saw I had Wounds and remembered it was a reddit rec. 

Holy shit, this series of stories was amazing. I felt like the Hell that Ballingrud builds and the mythos (creatures/magic/satanism/carrion angels) that he writes is something that I want more of.

Many people had talked about The Visible Filth as a noteworthy story and while it was great, I felt like The Butcher’s Table was the fucking piece-de-resistance. It’s one of those final stories in a short story collection that brings in everything from previous stories but smartly and in layers. The characters are all introduced, they’re all terrible people with exception of the actual bloodythirsty pirates, but the writing presents them and builds the tension bringing in new elements and twists. You thought this weird satanic cult has power, well this other satanic cult looks down on them and laughs. Oh there’s a black market for items from hell, how does that affect the world or the people who deal in that? Wait there’s a Cannibal Priest with a femme fatale daughter? It just keeps building and building to a piano wire tension and it ends absolutely beautifully. I actually teared up listening to the narration of the final character because the prose presented still packs a bit of a punch. The Butcher’s Table is an A+ for me. 

And truthfully all of the stories were interesting and worth it! Thanks again y’all! I add my voice to recommending it!",horrorlit

1711570525.0,Dead Eleven by Jimmy Juliano,"So last month I went to my local bookstore and found a display of Dead Eleven where the books were completely wrapped in black construction paper with very few details other than the title, author, trigger warnings (death of a child), and a brief blurb calling it the most original horror novel in years. I thought it was the most brilliant marketing technique for a horror novel and I immediately bought a copy and was given the dust jacket in a separate manila envelope instructed not to open it until after finishing the book. The bookstore was adamant that the book was to read going in completely blind and I was completely sold.

Well I just finished the book last night and going in blind did have an interesting effect. I was completely unaware what the book was about even as I was reading it. Is it a ghost story? A cult? A monster creature feature? The formatting of the book was also very interesting as it read almost like a found footage/analogue horror movie. Overall I enjoyed the book but I found it to be a little too slow paced and I thought the big reveal was underwhelming. I haven't opened the book jacket yet so I'm curious to finally see the cover. Given how the book was advertised I would have thought it would have a bigger following but I haven't seen anyone talking about it. Interestingly it's already being adapted into a movie which I think might be a better medium for this kind of story

Spoilers for those who read it: >!So turns out it ended up being a combination cult/ghost/monster book which was kind cool to see all three blended together. While I didn't really find any of the monster/ghost scenes to be that scary, the cult aspect really got under my skin especially towards the end when Kayla buys into the indoctrination. The one ghost scene that I found particularly creepy was when Lily has her first encounter with a Dead Thing at the abandoned school. Not so much because of the ghost's presence but more because of her finally realizing that there's actual truth to the legends and her trying to rebuild the walls of her skepticism. One thing about the reveal that kinda irks me is that the Demon is powerful enough to wipe out entire islands but is content to be trapped in the basement of the mansion. I at first suspected that it was a creature similar to IT where it went off a generational cycle reawakening every few couple of decades. And that the cult was pretending to be stuck in the 90's so that the demon would think that the century hasn't ended yet. I was mostly right but instead it was more about the island gaslighting the demon into thinking it just ate instead of it being 30 years since it's last meal. How this demon could simultaneously be strong enough to decimate entire populations yet so easily fooled by the islands plan just feels kinda silly!<",horrorlit

1711532366.0,True Crime taken to task in Pocket Hell - Penance by Eliza Clark,"The ethics of using real life violent crime as content canon fodder is one that I've always been of two minds about. On one hand, I've always been just as morbidly curious in the mechanics of which human beings find ways to hurt each other in the most extreme ways as anyone. I've read about my fair share of cases I've endlessly obsessed about, still find myself going down rabbit holes researching. I do see the merits in making dramas on subjects like real life serial killers like Netflix's infamous *Dahmer* series. There were details of the case I had personally never heard discussed before (which, to be fair I had to Google to verify were true, and not exactly all of them were, persay) about some of the orbiting figures in Dahmer's life. I never would have known to look up the very tragic real life story of Dahmer's own murderer and the injustice he suffered (though that wasn't covered much in the series itself.) With that said however, as someone who's had personal experiences that, though not nearly as extreme, give me some approximate understanding of what it must be like for the friends, families and survivors shoved into the public consciousness as sacrifices to the entertainment gods. Having what was likely one of the worst moment of their lives given a sometimes global audience, more often than not without their full consent, possibly without even their permission at all--- yeah, that does seem profoundly cruel. 

After spending my childhood and teenage years watching talk shows make dancing monkeys out of brutalized abuse victims, going down rabbit hole after rabbit hole of shock site content I was way too young to be looking at, spending some of my young adulthood listening to every white woman with a half decent camera casually describe some of the most horrific cases while she did her makeup, I found myself pretty well done with true crime personally. The lack of genuine thoughtful deconstruction of the reasons why people inflict this much pain on each other, how quickly it all devolved into exploitation and rubber-necking, I just tapped out. That's why, despite absolutely adoring Eliza Clark's first novel *Boy Parts*, when I read the blurb on what *Penance* was about when it was released, I sat on it for a good few months. I immediately recognized the real life crime the bones of the plot is based off of, and it put me off. Which I submit to you now as my final thesis on why book blurbs need to git gud, because I'm pretty sure Clark shares my frustrations on the subject matter. I've now completed a second read through a couple months after my first, and I feel this may be one of my favorite novels of all time. 

*Penance* is not only a masterfully written, absolutely haunting read, it functions as a exceedingly clever metafictial deconstruction of the true crime fad as a whole. It's not just loosely inspired by one, but a whole plethora of real life famous cases, some of which are even mention directly in the narrative. Clark manages to expertly weave together several true events into one cohesive story. The novel obscures each just enough to keep away from making any false equivalencies in analogy to any real cases, while maintaining a brutal feeling of realism. It plays with the audience's familiarity with one or more, if not most of the violent crimes it alludes to, creating this eerie sense of deja vu. Details of the narrative sound consistently farmiliar enough you'd swear you heard it before. On first read through the book even managed to trick me with one of it's minor plot points involving a fandom centered around a school shooting. I was sure I had heard of it before--- which the book lightly pokes fun at actually, there being so many school shooting in America now they're blurring together. The setting itself is also crafted expertly to create this sense of familiarity. You may have never been to or lived in a dying British beach town, but some element of it's characterization I'm sure will spark a connection in most people's brains of knowing a place like it. 

With this book along with her last I feel like Clark has truely solidified herself as something of a prominent voice of a generation--- namely, mine. Zillennials who were raised on unrestricted internet access between the dying breaths of the online wild west and the rise in social media. That most of the references and humor rely on the reader's familiarity with that general flavor of a chronically online lonely youth means some of it may not hit with all readers, but it had me pissing myself laughing at key moments. Furthermore, I feel it genuinely paint a raw, authentic experience of being a mentally unwell teenage girl left to rot quietly in a hostile community. Through the narrative's thorough exploration of the three primary culprits responsible for the horrific murder of a fellow classmate's metal states, you get three distinct ways the town itself and the small compounding failures of the adults around them fostered this series of events. It makes a compelling case it was almost inevitable. By crafting a story so reminiscent yet abstracted from real events, this novel feels a lot more like a meaningful examination of extreme violent crimes than most real coverage of it does. 

The biggest surprise for me however was the thorough dressing down the journalist acting as the reader's narrator gets in the text itself. The narrative sprinkles hints and details about his personal life that, though not in any way directly related to the plot, adds an intriguing secondary layer of examination that really makes this book something special. As a ride or die stan of the unreliable narrator, it's great to see one taken to task for being unreliable in the text--- I love it. He's the source of the book's biggest gut punch when it comes to satirizing the true crime genre. Though as a reader you can to some degree pick apart what elements of the novel were most impacted by his bias, as it roles to a close it leaves you with a lingering sense of unease. It denies you a sense of closure in the lack of confidence what truely took place. Clark, in a stroke of true evil genius, twists the knife with references to resources canonical in the novel with further (possibly more accurate) information is available that, of course, don't actually exist--- because this is fiction. This didn't really happen. You're left not really knowing. 

This book isn't one full of tense, brutal descriptions. It's frontloaded with one absolutely gruesome chapter that flavors the mounting dread as it recounts the events that led up to that horrific scene, for a more subtle, but palpable disturbing read. It's also somewhere between short and medium length, so you can get through it easily in one session if you're a fast reader. Even if true crime isn't your thing, I think it's worth a read. If it is, I doubt you'll walk away feeling judged or scolded for your taste in content--- just provided with some interesting perspective to chew on. I highly recommend checking this one out.

Yesterday I realized that someone on Wikipedia had put in a horrible AI generated mess of a synopsis for Don’t Fear the Reaper.  It really bothered me because it’s such a beautiful book, so I decided to try to write my own synopsis.

On December 12, 2019, nearly five years after the events of My Heart is a Chainsaw, 22 year old Jennifer “Jade” Daniels is released from prison and returns to her hometown of Proofrock, Idaho.  Jade was arrested because she was captured on video killing her father, however she could not be convicted of his murder because his body, which sunk to the bottom of the lake, was never found. 

A blizzard covers the Proofrock area, blocking cellular and internet service, and making travel difficult for the rest of the novel.

A Proofrock high school student, Toby Manx, is lured out of a motel where he was having a romantic tryst with his classmate Gwen Stapleton on the outskirts of town.  He believes another one of his female classmates wants to have sex with him but isn’t sure who it is. Once outside however, he is eviscerated and dies in the motel parking lot.

On the same day Jade returns and the blizzard begins, an Indigenous serial killer, Dark Mill South, is being transported through the area under armed guard in order to lead authorities to the bodies of some of his victims.  Dark Mill South seems to be a supernatural figure, he is unnaturally strong and resistant to injury, and doesn’t seem to feel pain.  A previous confrontation with one of his victims left him with a missing hand, which he has replaced with a hook.

Dark Mill South escapes custody near Proofrock.  Later, it is explained that the vibrations made by the large convoy caused an avalanche, killing everyone (including two Proofrock police officers), except for Dark Mill South and one snowplough driver.  South kills the driver and steals his snowplough, escaping to hide in the ruins of Terra Nova, the luxury home development across the lake from Proofrock that was abandoned after most of its residents were murdered in *Chainsaw.*

Jade first meets with former sheriff Amos Hardy outside of town.  He shows her a beautiful white elk he has observed, the elk is walking on the frozen lake and later walks around downtown Proofrock during the blizzard, seemingly lost.

Hardy and Jade are driven from the town’s dam control, where Hardy now works, to the town by junior deputy Banner Tompkins, Jade’s former high school classmate, now married to Letha Mondragon, who Jade believed in *Chainsaw* was the “final girl” who would save the town.

Jade and Letha have not spoken in several years, after Letha withdrew her support from Jade’s defence when Jade implicated Letha’s father Theo Mondragon in several of the killings in the previous novel.

Letha and Banner have a 2 year old daughter named Adrienne.  Letha, who was severely injured in Chainsaw when the ghost of Stacy Graves tried to rip off her jaw, has spent the intervening years becoming an expert in slasher movies like Jade, believing that she could have saved the massacre victims if she had been more aware of the supernatural threat. Letha has a replacement jaw, however she still has difficulty talking and eating, and needs to take antibiotics and pain killers multiple times a day.

Cinnamon Baker, a survivor of the previous massacre and now a high school senior, calls 911 and speaks with Banner and Jade.  She claims that Toby was killed after they had met for sex in a car, which the reader knows is incorrect based on the book’s opening scene.  Cinnamon also claims to have found the body of Toby’s first lover, Gwen, disemboweled and hanging from a tree.  She evades questions about inconsistencies in her story by sounding panicked and claims that she saw someone matching Dark Mill South’s description committing the murders.  Jade notes that the deaths sound similar to the opening scenes of the slasher movie *Scream*. Cinnamon is taken to the police station for her safety overnight but is not locked in a cell.

The next day, Jade is picked up by Letha and taken to the police station.  Banner has not heard from the other police officers, and no one in town is aware of the avalanche.  The three discover that Cinnamon has escaped.  Banner and Jade follow her footprints to a nearby retirement home.

Cinnamon’s twin sister Ginger is essentially imprisoned at the same retirement home, supposedly for her own safety.  During the massacre of the Terra Nova residents that took place during *Chainsaw* she had a panic attack and was left behind alone on the yacht while construction worker Grade Paulson (called “Shooting Glasses” by Jade) rescued Ginger and Galatea Pangborn. Ginger escaped the yacht and survived in the woods for several weeks, becoming violent and experiencing delusions.  Ginger and Cinnamon are identical twins, but Ginger’s head is kept shaved so she doesn’t try to pull out her hair. It is later revealed that Ginger is capable of escaping the retirement home and does so regularly.

Banner leaves Jade at the retirement home and returns to the station.  While waiting to hear about Cinnamon’s recovery, Jade sneaks into Ginger’s room speak with her, and later stumbles onto the bodies of two high school-aged retirement home employees, who have been stabbed to death after sneaking off to an empty room to have sex.  Jade notices that these murders are similar to the deaths of two characters in another slasher film, *Friday the 13th* (the boy was pierced through the throat with an arrow and the girl was killed by a fire axe to the face). Deciding she needs to return to the police station to warn Banner about the killings, she discovers the body of another teen employee, who was suffocated when a garment bag was placed over his head.  Jade notes this death is similar to a death in the movie *Black Christmas*. She uses the teen’s snowmobile to return to the police station.

Concurrently, three students (Abby, Wynona and Jensen) sneak into the high school to play a game of strip basketball. Wynona is attacked and killed with a heavy trophy, and Abby is attacked with the lid of a toilet tank, which destroys one side of her face. Jensen is stabbed in the head from behind and then runs into the antlers of a mounted elk head while trying to escape (Similar to a death in *Silent Night, Deadly Night*).  The scene is shown from Jensen’s perspective, he never sees his attacker(s).

Abby, badly injured but alive is able to call the police station.  Banner and Jade are eventually able to bring the town doctor to the school to help Abby, although she is said to have later died of her injuries.

Jade calls Cinnamon from Abby’s cell phone.  Cinnamon claims to still be at the retirement home.  Jade asks Cinnamon to confirm a story that Ginger had told her earlier, about the two girls finding a blob of organic tissue under a pier in 2015 that got bigger when they fed it meat, and that Cinnamon (after Ginger was locked up at the retirement home) saw grow into a human girl who later disappeared.  Cinnamon confirms seeing the blob, but believed it was gore left from the massacre, and denies feeding it.  Jade is unsure if she should believe Cinnamon.

Meanwhile, Letha, alone with her daughter at the station, sees a figure outside and shoots him, believing it to be Dark Mill South. She actually shoots Rexall, the school janitor, who is out because he believes he saw Tab Daniels, his best friend and Jennifer’s father, through the cameras he has hidden around town.  Dark Mill South was previously said to resemble Tab. 

Rexall, in pain but not severely hurt, lashes out at Banner and Lonnie (the town mechanic and another friend of Tab and Rexall) when they try to help him. Banner shoots the weapon Lonnie was going to attack Rexall with out of Lonnie’s hand, and then places Rexall in a holding cell since he doesn’t have anywhere else to put him.

Banner and Rexall later hear something heavy slamming into the side of the police station, and Rexall, terrified, shouts that “she” is trying to get him. The attacker is later implied to be the white elk.
 
Jade believes that the blob the twins found under the pier may have been a reanimated Stacy Graves, so Letha and Jade take a snowmobile across the frozen lake to investigate Terra Nova.  While there, Jade and Letha bond over their situation and their shared love of slasher movies. Jade also points out to Letha that many of the deaths resemble deaths from slasher movies.

Jade and Letha accidentally stumble across Dark Mill South, who has been hiding in one of the abandoned homes.  South’s internal monologue reveals that he has been hiding at Terra Nova the entire time since his escape, and therefore he could not have been involved in the recent murders.

Letha slightly injures South by throwing knives at him, however he quickly recovers, and throws one of the knives back at her, injuring her shoulder.  Forcing Jade to hide under a sink, Letha leads South away by running to another house.  Jade follows attacks South from behind with a hammer, causing him to fall through rotting floorboards of the house to the basement. This slows South down slightly, but injures Letha further when the house collapses.

The two women lose the snowmobile key in the struggle, and are forced to walk back across the lake.  On the way they meet Claude Armitage, the high school history teacher.

Armitage has been using cross country skis to ski across the frozen lake to Camp Blood, as he is obsessed with slasher films as well as the Proofrock massacre.

Armitage’s internal monologue reveals that he has or had an illicit sexual relationship with Cinnamon Baker.  He is also implied to be grooming Galatea, who is only 14.  

Upon returning to the shore of the town, Armitage, Jade and Letha discover the mutilated body of Lonnie. Armitage believes Lonnie’s murder resembles the opening scene from *It Follows.*

They also find the snowmobile, meaning Dark Mill South found the key and is already in Proofrock.

The trio return to the police station, Letha passes out from her injuries and is not involved in the rest of the plot.

Hardy and Cinnamon also arrive separately at the police station.

Prior to arriving at the police station, Cinnamon has, at Banner’s request, driven to Main Street using Banner’s truck to warn eight of her high school classmates to lock themselves in the video store they run for a class project, for their own safety.  The students were previously unaware of the murders and were out shovelling Main street to keep it clean for local businesses.

At the station, Cinnamon explains that she lied to Ginger about feeding the blob so her twin would continue talking to her.  Ginger wanted the blob to kill Proofrock residents and for the murders to be blamed on Jade, in revenge for the twins parents and the other Terra Nova residents being murdered and Jade not being able to stop the massacre.

After this however, “Cinnamon’s” wig falls off, and she is revealed to be a disguised Ginger. Ginger then runs away.

Jade and Armitage leave the station.  Jade plans to get the doctor from the high school to help Letha, and Armitage goes to the retirement home to see if the real Cinnamon is still there.

Jade passes through Main Street and sees Banner’s truck, left unlocked and running.

She finds one of the twins murdered beside the truck.  Jade believes the dead twin is Cinnamon and that she has been killed by Ginger.

The truck is next to the video store. Jade sees a body in the video store window and goes inside. Most of the teens are dead.  They were given poisoned cupcakes by Ginger or Cinnamon, a reference to the film *Happy Death Day.*

After they died, Dark Mill South entered the store and began mutilating their bodies.  Jade believes it was South who killed the twin Jade found outside, and since she has not seen *Happy Death Day*, which came out when she was in jail, she believes South killed all the teens.

Jade and the still-living teens try to fight Dark Mill South. Jade escapes onto the street.  South follows, and the other twin (who Jade believes is Cinnamon) arrives and confronts South, claiming that he killed her sister.

South is slowed by Cinnamon, but when he turns to attack Jade, Kimmy, Jade’s absentee mother who was working at the dollar store nearby, attacks South with her purse.  

Suddenly, Kimmy is killed by the white elk, which is still wandering Main Street.

The white elk, which is also implied to be the blob Ginger and Cinnamon found under the pier, is a manifestation of the vengeful spirit of Melanie Hardy, sheriff Hardy’s daughter who drowned near the dam at age 12 while swimming with her friends.  The elk only attacks the people who were with Melanie when she died. It was therefore the elk that killed Lonnie and attacked Rexall when he was in the jail cell.

The elk leaves after killing Kimmy.

Cinnamon tries to attack South again, but he is too strong and he throws her into the truck’s bumper. Cinnamon is badly injured but lives.

Near the end of the novel it is revealed that both twins had shaved their heads and were wearing wigs. It is implied that Cinnamon may have been the one committing the murders, in retaliation for her classmates spreading rumours about her relationship with Armitage.

Jade also comes to believe, near the end of the novel, that Cinnamon killed her classmates, and also killed her sister, although she doesn’t fully understand Cinnamon’s motivations.  Jade reasons that Cinnamon planned the murders to resemble murders from slasher movies in order to frame Jade, but later decided Dark Mill South was a more believable scapegoat.

Armitage returns and attacks South with a machete, but South shoots him. Armitage is badly injured but lives.

Before South can recover and attack Jade again, Banner, who has found the snowplough South stole to escape, hits South with the plough and drives it into the lake, hoping to drown South.

Hardy comes to Main Street after hearing the commotion, and Jade, Banner and Hardy are shocked to find South still alive and walking across the ice to attack again.

Hardy tells Jade and Banner to escape, but they know his gun is only filled with birdshot that will not kill South.

Jade runs through the snow to find a weapon.  She finds her trash grabbing stick, which she hidden behind some bushes in the previous novel.  She rushes Dark Mill South and stabs him in the heart, finally killing him.

After South’s death, Jade and Hardy sit outside and Rexall is sent to bring them in. The white elk arrives tries to gore Rexall but can’t, and Rexall shoots the elk.  The dead elk seems to dissolve, and inside it is a version of Melanie Hardy, who is also dissolving.  Jade and Hardy walk across the lake in order to return her spirit to the lake.  It is implied that Hardy decides to drown with his daughter so their spirits could reunite.

When the authorities arrive, Jade takes responsibility for driving the snowplow into the lake so Banner doesn’t loose his job, both out of friendship and because she believes Banner can better protect the town from future threats than new officers.

Jade is arrested, since destroying public property violates her parole.

Before being taken away by police helicopter, Jade holds Dark Mill South’s hook hand up in triumph.

1711503618.0,90s Set Horror Books,"A horror BookTok about the '90s set novel The Golden Basement has made me want to read more '90s horror. Not necessarily books FROM the '90s, but books that have a '90s feel. In the video Tessa McBessa talks about the book's ""happy bleakness"" which has become my new favorite concept. It has a darkly nostalgic quality more about looking back at the time period than living in it. Like how a lot of Ray Bradbury's stuff from the 60s set in a fictionalized version of his old hometown has the flavor of the rural '20s.

1711499203.0,"Lingering confusion after reading ""The Ring"" by Suzuki","I finished all 5 ring novels and I honestly just felt more confused afterwards. There were a few gaps here and there that just didn’t make sense. For example, Ryuji/Kaoru dies at the end of Birthday from rapid aging but is apparently still alive in S, even though he is then executed and becomes a fucking digital ghost? Or like what Akane did during those 6 unaccounted minutes where the story said she turned her phone off or what she did to Niimura during that, or why Niimura killed all the remaining 12y/o Sadako and was after Akane next. It wasn’t really explained what the significance of the letter “S” is and it was only mentioned 3 times (not including the title): when prisoner Seiji (actual identity Ryuji/Kaoru) is given capital punishment for the false indictment of 4 kidnappings writes the letter S in a book, when a kid in a hospital waiting room writes an S in the form of a snake, and when Akane hears 2 girls that talk about a creepy video when you lookup “S” online at her wedding (she couldn’t locate them).  
It kinda made sense that the 1st edition Ring novels carried a virus and that later editions also carried the inoculation, but maybe Niimura was infected by this book and was guided to do what he did by Sadako. But why? Sadako died at the end of Birthday and wasn’t in S, except for the fact that she had little clones running around and that Akane was her child / look-a-like.  
And then there’s the whole outer simulation conspiracy that someone from outside the sim is interfering and pulling strings, which is the most likely explanation in the entire series. I mean it doesn’t really make sense why Sadako has psychic powers or why beams of light (tell tale sign of someone outside sim looking in) appear: when Mai Takano died trapped on a rooftop, when Ryuji was saying hi to his girlfriend, when Niimura was guided to walk in front of the train (who was he controlled by, “God” or Akane, because Sadako is known to possess the power to control people, like in  Birthday), when Sadako’s lover was dying in her hands at the end of Birthday, etc. Still a lot unanswered, like also why Sadako’s theater friends all died like 30 years later or why she left her lover to be last. I mean it was implied that her psychic virus got carried in the sex tape that was broadcast over the casting speakers and the people that heard it were infected. I’m not even sure WTF the little altar with the placenta was about. Something about pregnancy, even though Sadako wasn’t pregnant or going to be pregnant at the time.  
I also have no idea why outside the simulation, Suiki’s child knew she was doing the sex with Kaoru, and then FUCKING KILLED HIMSELF after he found out. I mean he had stage 4000 cancer but the fuck, jealous?  
And then there’s the psychopathy of Dr Eliot introducing the Ring virus into the host universe so he could invent a cure and then get more money for his stupid simulation  
Also I was so confused by the mention of “citrus” and “sour” when describing Sadako’s powers. Why citrus? Why did Asakawa experience that when he felt his premonition about Ryuji? There were also other times when simulated characters had that, like the Theatre Boyfriend (I think?). Mentions:  
• Shizuku receiving visions after rescuing the statue from the water, “citrus fragance”  
• Asakawa watching Ryuji walk up stairs, “scent of citrus…”  
• Not exactly, but when the niece in Book 1 is being stalked, she describes her stalker as giving off a “sour stench”  
• When Ryuji talked about raping that girl in college, “I can smell it- the impulse I felt then” which is extremely similar to what the Dr felt when he described his impulse for raping Sadako.  
• When Asakawa and Ryuji breach the well, “a putrid smell arose on the cold air”  
Something else that is unresolved is why Ryuji was compelled to lie about raping the girl to appear cool, but if it really did happen, why was he either compelled by Sadako or “God” to do so?  
Also, just a footnote, but this author does not know how to write women. I almost puked when he started describing teenage puss and how spherical Akane’s boobs were.",horrorlit

1711496037.0,Specific book rec request,"This is going to be tedious, because my wife can be very picky, but I'm trying to find a good book recommendation that fits her admittedly very specific niche. I'm just curious if anyone here has recs. Her favorite type of book is at the crossroads between ghostly paranormal, horror, mystery fiction, and romance. 

Her favorite books would be these slightly older Simone St. James books, as opposed to her newer work, which becomes more thriller than ghostly mystery:
-The Haunting of Maddy Clare 
-An Inquiry Into Love and Death
-The Other Side of Midnight 
-Silence for the Dead 
-Lost Among the Living 

She likes books by Wendy Webb, Karen White, Colleen Gleason, Jennifer McMahon, and also Kerri Maniscalco. She also liked The Last Days of Jack Sparks by Jason Arnopp.

She couldn't really get into Susanna Kearsley or Darcy Coates.

Specifically: 1. Books that focus on a mystery, 2. Have ghosts in them (but aren't directly a medium just openly chatting away with them), 3. Aren't overly depressive (couple who are grieving the loss of their child, etc.), and 4. If it has any romance in it, that's an added bonus that she really doesn't mind.

1711457435.0,Help me! I'm looking for short stories where someone murders a family member or loved one.,"I have a fairly specific request. 

I'm looking for **short stories** where:

* An ordinary person is driven by unusual circumstances to murder a family member or a loved one. Typically because it's slowly revealed over the course of the story that the victim was actually a giant asshole.
* The character who commits murder is NOT clearly evil to the reader from page 1, not clearly mentally unhinged from page 1, or secretly a serial killer, abusive, etc. They actually seem like a normal, everyday person who wouldn't do that type of thing.
* The murderer is the protagonist, probably the main character, and you follow their emotional journey from ordinary person to murderer.
* The murderous character is actually somewhat sympathetic, and the horror of the story is that you can see the twisted logic and emotional drive and relate to why they end up doing something so horrible. *Oh no, I'm relating to a murderer!*

Some examples of the vibe I'm looking for:

""Children of the Fang"" by John Langan: >!The main character finds out what an evil, manipulative dick her grandpa is, and that he was probably behind the mysterious disappearance of her uncle (IIRC). While kind of possessed by that reptile/dinosaur that imbues her with a murderous rage, she kills him. What an awful thing to do, but as a reader you can't help but understand where she's coming from to a degree.!< 

*Midsommar:* >!Of course a movie not a short story, but it's a great example. Dani is grieving after a double-murder suicide of her family that is truly one of the most nightmarish things you can imagine happening to you. And yet through the whole movie, her boyfriend is ridiculously selfish, unsupportive and insensitive to her emotional needs.!< 

>!So when the cult are the only people around showing her any support or compassion, you can't help but feel an awful sense of sympathy for her as she decides to join the cult and choose her boyfriend as the guy that is immolated alive.!<

I thought about *The Shining,* but it doesn't really fit because Jack isn't a very sympathetic character IMHO, he's not the protagonist, and he doesn't ""succeed."" Sure, you sympathize with him more in the book than the movie because you see his POV as a guy struggling with alcoholism and possession, but he's still the antagonist and unquestionably the villain. 

I'm open to suggestions for movies too, even novels if that's what jumps to mind, but I am MOST interested in short stories recs.",horrorlit
1711453656.0,“I’m thinking of ending things”,"How did Kaufman butcher this book so badly? Especially with the cast he had. I think the actors absolutely nailed their characters but the book is SO much better than the movie. 

I know some people have issues with some things not being tied up (the caller, the man at the window) but I think the book is amazing. I wish the movie would have stayed true to the ending. It could have been Lucy stabbing Jake with the coat hanger and then the camera pans out and it’s actually Jake stabbing himself (getting flashbacks to Toni Collette decapitating herself in hereditary).

Reid does a great job at painting the creepy rural atmosphere. As someone who moved from the suburbs to a rural area, it’s on the fucking nose. Especially the ending part about his parents staying together just for convenience. In these desolate areas, many people feel like they don’t have the option to leave, or to change. The ice cream scene is my favorite. Full body chills. “You don’t have to go.” So powerful.

I think the loose ends add to the emotions one would experience while being that close to suicide. All the what’s ifs and blurry memories one would have.

So yeah, I'm a college student in my final year and I'm writing my final paper on societal anxieties in the second half of the twentieth century, focusing on fears directed at queer people, emancipation of women and class struggles, following them in Rosemary's Baby, Child of God and Fight Club, using mostly queer&feminist studies and marxist class analysis

This is my first time making a post on Reddit, but I've been looking for a book I read a long time ago, so I thought I'd check here to see if anyone can help me.  
I don't remember the name or author of the book, but here's the plot:  
A group of horror authors are brought together to a haunted house to write a book together. During their stay in this house, they are also being filmed by a television company (I think I remember something about the company being a little suspicious, but they were trying to make money, they weren't doing anything with the haunting). Weird things kept happening (as they do in horror books) and one of the characters is pushed into a hole by a tree (I think). Also, the top floor of the house is boarded off and somehow one of the characters gets stuck there. The boarded up part played a really big role in the book, because one of the spirits that haunted the house was boarded up there by someone else. (SPOILER ALERT) at the end of the book, it's revealed within the last two pages that one of the authors (the only woman) turned out to be a fake version of herself with silver eyes (or with one silver eye or something about her eye was different).  
I know that the author was male (you can tell by how the female character was written) and I do have an excerpt of the book which I'll put down below:  
""...the two couldn't have looked more different: a bulky, wool coat draped over Sebastien's tall, frail body; tight black jeans and an even tighter long-sleeve tee with a lace-up front clung to Moore, barely containing.... Together they were the reluctant intersection of Elegance and Rebellion.""

I like King a lot, The Stand and Pet Semetary have been favorites for a long time - thought I’d give Revival a chance because consistently I see pretty glowing reviews for it in this sub… But I guess I just expected more?

I enjoyed some pieces of the story - he is a master of slow burn characterization, was compelled by Jamie’s story. The Frankenstein parallels were cool and I thought they worked better than the faux-Lovecraft bits. But for whatever reason the cosmic horror of this story just fell flat to me, and the “dark” ending felt more like a cheap turn of the knife than anything else. Like the end of a subpar Black Mirror episode - bleakness for the sake of bleakness, the emotional punch wasn’t there.

I have mixed feelings. I did enjoy the writing style (I often find that ‘splatter punk’ horror suffers from poor writing despite interesting plots) but it was just kind of…. Lacking something?

1711396131.0,I finally started my 17-book adventure to The Dark Tower with The Stand and it's a horror masterpiece,"“The Stand” by Stephen King is a novel I regret not reading sooner. I knew going into this that greatness was awaiting since many readers consider this one of King’s best books ever written and let me tell you, it delivered and then some. In case you didn’t know, I have officially decided to start my journey to The Dark Tower and wanted to do a ton of pre-reading to ensure I get the complete experience the best I can.

I am conquering The Dark Tower by reading all these books leading up to it. In case you want to know what I think the best reading route to go is, here’s how I’m reading everything after weeks of research and asking several Constant Readers for their feedback...

The Stand  
The Eyes of the Dragon  
Insomnia  
Hearts in Atlantis  
‘Salem’s Lot  
The Talisman  
Black House  
Everything's Eventual (The Little Sisters of Eluria)  
The Dark Tower I: The Gunslinger  
The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three  
The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands  
Charlie the Choo-Choo  
The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass  
The Dark Tower: The Wind Through the Keyhole  
The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla  
The Dark Tower VI: Song of Susannah  
The Dark Tower VII: The Dark Tower

I know, I know. 17 books. I have thousands of hours of reading ahead of me but if “The Stand” is any indication, this will easily be one of the best reading experiences of my life. I’m super excited to finally read all these books (some I have already read) and my goal is to be finished before King’s next new anthology “You Like It Darker” comes out on May 21, 2024.

Before I jump into my review, I found a ton of trigger warnings while reading as many of these are very graphic. They were…

\- Cancer  
\- Suicide  
\- Abortion  
\- Domestic abuse (physical)  
\- Racism  
\- Pandemic  
\- Quarantine  
\- Dead animals (cars, dogs, kittens, rabbits, and rats)  
\- Drugs  
\- Drinking and driving  
\- Parental abuse (mental and physical)  
\- Vaccination  
\- Rape  
\- Bullying  
\- Dead children  
\- Burning churches  
\- Homophobia  
\- Death of a child  
\- Self-harm  
\- Cannibalism  
\- Violence against women  
\- Religion  
\- Politics  
\- Violence against animals (hens and chickens)

If any of these triggers you, please do not read this novel. “The Stand” is hands down a horror masterpiece and at this point in my life, the longest book I have ever read. This tome is 1,348 pages deep and I know is an intimidating number to many but it’s worth it.

There are two versions of “The Stand” which is the original one that was released and truncated in 1975 due to how much of a behemoth this novel was at the time and a newly re-released “complete and uncut” one in 1990. I went with the latter since King re-added over 400 pages of text that were removed and revised everything to unleash the true vision of this novel he wanted. I love how King wrote about that to start this novel off to keep it real with his Constant Readers. It is officially King’s longest stand-alone novel in his catalog and will go down in history as one of the greatest horror novels ever written.

King held nothing back in “The Stand” as the intense opening set the groundwork for one hell of a ride. I loved the tension and suspense right off the bat and instantly loved all the unique characters I met along the way.

Speaking of which, there are a ton of characters in this novel to the point where I had to take quick notes on who is who due to a lengthy list of people. I didn’t want to get confused but thanks to my notes, it was pretty easy to remember everyone and enjoy everything in stride. I also loved all the references King had in here from my hometown of Queens here in New York, Freddy Krueger, The Lord of the Rings, Shirley Jackson, Norman Bates, and many more.

This novel was divided into three books all of which contained a bunch of mini-stories in addition to the main story. It was just a brilliant way of formatting everything so you are still kept in the loop of what was going on with the main characters and also all these side characters. I loved how you never knew who could end up being one to keep an eye on as their story progressed.

There weren’t any boring parts as all the dialogue, situations, and horror were top-notch. King is the master of subtle horror that hits you and continues bringing that terrifying dread of what was ultimately going on. Needless to say, this novel hit home with me and probably many other readers since it’s eerily similar to the whole COVID-19 pandemic we dealt with a few years ago. Imagine that but taken to extreme new heights in a way only King can deliver.

All the descriptions, stories, atmosphere, and overall horror are perfection. I couldn’t put this novel down as it took me over two weeks to read and I even dedicated my days off from work to get through it because it’s such a massive and addictive novel. It’s great and I assure you if you’re one of those readers that think this book is too big or would take forever to read, it’s worth it if you chip away each day and don’t rush anything. Take your time reading this as it’s a novel you will never forget for the rest of your life.

Another nice touch was how King added graphic illustrations to this novel as you read to capture some pivotal (and creepy) moments to add to this epic reading experience. I love when authors do this since it brings me back to my teenage days of reading horror paperback books where every chapter had a graphic illustration or they were sprinkled in between chapters.

King did not hold back when it came to all the horror, gore, and creepiness. Some of which I couldn’t believe and made many weird faces while reading as I started to put the pieces together to the mystery of this disease. Once that was revealed, a whole new part of this novel opened up to situations I never read before in a horror novel.

Once all the characters were finally connected and the race to the end was on, this is where “The Stand” truly delivered. There’s even more horror including a bloodbath of an action scene that was unexpected and pretty intense with some of the main characters. Out of this impressive roster of characters, while hard to choose, I loved Frannie, Stu, Nick, and of course, Kojak the dog. I can’t also leave out the main antagonist who had some scenes that sent chills down my spine… the infamous “Man in Black” Randall Flagg.

This was the first time I’ve ever read a novel involving Flagg and wow, I can see why he is despised by so many. Some of the situations involving Flagg were insane and now that I got my introduction to him, I’m excited to see what happens in the future with such an iconic villain in King’s Dark Tower universe.

The climactic race to the end was monumental as King takes the famous “good vs. bad” angle to new horrific heights. Don’t worry, I won’t spoil anything for you but all the plot twists and turns led to an awesome drop-the-mic ending. It was so good that I went back to re-read the last few chapters again because they were outstanding. I never saw that coming and am beyond satisfied with how it ended. The range of emotions from sadness, laughter, rage, disbelief, hope, and heartwarming moments were just some of what I experienced while reading this novel. All of which will last a lifetime with me as it was such a powerhouse of a novel.

I give “The Stand” by Stephen King a 5/5 and would give it a 10/5 if I could because this was by far one of the best novels I’ve ever read by King and in my entire life. The incredible story, memorable characters, a villain for the ages, brutal horror that only King can deliver, and the power of hope led to such a powerful read. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to prepare for the next step in my journey to The Dark Tower as I plan to start “The Eyes of the Dragon” next.

1711387067.0,Please help me find the name of this book,"I read this years ago. Not horror per se but I believe this group may have read it. The books plot is about reincarnation. It begins with a cave-manesque type scene. The main character is a woman and works for The Natural History Museum in NYC. The storyline goes back and forth between her current timeline and her previous lives. For the life of me, I cannot remember it.

1711387058.0,Lemon Demon Spirit Phone -esque,"I love the album Spirit Phone by Lemon Demon. It is a masterpiece of an album full of spooky synth riffs and mysterious, narrative driven songs. It oozes style and eccentricity. From songs about living arcade cabinets full of human organs, to conspiracy theorists calling into radio stations with unspeakable truths, to reviving pop stars from the grave in order to produce more albums. It's a great, great album.

Now, does anyone know of any horror lit that matches that album in tone and style? I'd kill for a good book that reads in the same way that Spirit Phone feels. ",horrorlit
1711386023.0,I Who Have Never Known Men by Jacqueline Harpman,"Not sure if this is a true horror novel, but it certainly is a horrific situation and I’ve been thinking about it ever since i finished a few days ago. A very quick read and truly fascinating. 

The plot (without spoilers):

>Thirty-nine women and a girl are being held prisoner in a cage underground. The guards are all male, and never speak to them. The girl is the only one of the prisoners who has no memory of the outside world; none of them know why they are being held prisoner, or why there is one child among thirty-nine adults.

Even though there aren’t any real explanations, every detail of the world in this book is so strange and open to possibilities, I can’t stop thinking about it. Anyone else read this book?

1711381633.0,Looking for something other than King.,"Edit: I've gotten so many recommendations! Thank you everyone, I'm going to make a list and get working on it!

I love reading horror and thrillers, and I have tried a couple different authors, but am having trouble finding something that I fully enjoy.

I've read;

Baby Teeth by Zoje Stage - hated it, very predictable and all around unenjoyable to read. Though, very easy and finished in one sitting.

My Best Friend's Exorcism by Grady Hendrix - not my cup of tea at all, read it to try the author, I'm okay not reading more. Also completed in one sitting.

The Only Good Indian by Stephen Graham Jones - I haven't finished it yet, but I really enjoy it!

The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson - I loved it, it gave me that, ""huh, wtf is going on,"" that I'm looking for.

Baby Teeth taught me that I don't want to read about rich people with no real problems. My Best Friend's Exorcism taught me that I don't want to read horror/comedy.

The Only Good Indian and Haunting of Hill House taught me that I enjoy reading about characters who lose their grip on reality and are haunted in one way or another.

My top five Kings (from what I've read);

1. Desperation
2. Rage
3. Sometimes They Come Back (short story)
4. I Am the Doorway (short story)
5. Salem's Lot

I like Desperation because of the ""ancient evil unearthed"" aspect of the book. I like casts of characters that are flawed and have to get over themselves to survive. I like reading about people working together.

I like Rage because it made me think. I Am the Doorway genuinely creeped me out (cosmophobia). Sometimes They Come Back is a huge inspiration for my own writing.

Salem's Lot is Salem's Lot.

Thank you!",horrorlit
1711380862.0,The Winnowing Draw by Michael Tichy (Weird Western),"A raw, weird, wild, and extremely violent examination of colonialism and American frontier expansion through the lens of a bloodthirsty army unit literally blazing a trail west and a cat and mouse game between a runaway boy and psychopathic bounty hunter. Supernatural creatures dot the landscape, posed as victims and resistance to those that would tame the wilds. Those that venture west will be stripped raw of who they think they are, their true selves revealed and the remaining visage is rarely kind to its owner.

The Winnowing Draw is more akin to Walk the Darkness Down by John Boden than S. Craig Zahler, the later of which gets mentioned here a lot, but fans of both will probably like this as well. It's a book rooted in exciting genre flair, but with bigger philosophical aspirations that work more often than they don't. What it lacks is a little bit of characterization in a few supporting characters and perhaps speeds too quickly towards its finale, but the baddies in particular are a delight to read. ",horrorlit

1711349155.0,Looking for more fun horror! ,"I had an amazing March of horror reads, and I’m hoping to find more along those lines. I haven’t had this much fun reading in a *long* time, and I’d like to keep the momentum going! 

This Delicious Death by Kayla Cottingham, A Touch of Jen by Beth Morgan, The Honeys by Ryan La Sala, and Into the Drowning Deep by Mira Grant were all fantastic and while not perfect, they were such a blast to read I didn’t even mind the flaws. 

Things I enjoyed about these various storylines: 

- Queer characters & romance! The build seemed so realistic against these gruisome backdrops. I usually don’t enjoy romance in horror, but it worked for me in some of these. 

- The humor to balance the scares

- As a marine scientist myself, I appreciated Mira Grant’s attention to ocean detail (even if a lot of it was nonsense, you can tell she cared!)

- Subverting of tropes like the zombies in This Delicious Death being people just trying to live peacefully alongside humans 

- Disability representation (why is a mermaid creature feature from 2017 the best depiction of autism & dead characters I’ve read?) 

If any of this sounds familiar to other books you enjoy, or even if you just got similar vibes, please let me know! Thanks a lot in advance for your time.

Who takes it?","John Langan’s *The Fisherman* is one of the most recommended and read books here, judging by the time I spend here. One third meditation on grief, one third dark fantasy adventure (easily my favorite portion of the book), and one third cosmic horror. 

Stephen Graham Jones’ *The Only Good Indians* is less golden calf and more polarizing. It’s a meditation on family legacies and trauma filtered through supernatural vengeance. People say there is too much basketball. A local (to me) cosmic horror bookstore owner described this as one of SGJ’s two classics (the other being *My Heart Is A Chainsaw*.)

Of these two books, my favorite moment came from TOGI in the deaths of Lewis, Peta, and Shaney. It surprised the shit out of me and was really well written. I’d say I also slightly enjoyed reading TOGI more, but it’s close.

1711297400.0,Wounds and North American Lake Monsters,"I read Wounds, the short story collection by Nathan Ballingrud. I thought it was really incredible. Each story was really unique and fascinating but also helped to build on the world. The Butchers Table was my favorite just because the extra length allowed for so much more development of the concepts and fascinating hell related worldbuilding. The Visible Filth is the one the collection is known for and it was really good too. The one that’s really stuck with me is The Maw, because of the bizarre connection between love and hell (which is also a theme throughout the book). The only one I didn’t really like was The Diabolist- had some cool concepts but didn’t tie them together very well. 

I just finished reading North American Lake Monsters, which is a collection by the same author. My favorite stories in this were The Good Husband, You Go Where It Takes You and The Way Station. The others were mostly really good too, except the issue was that I realized they were all kind of about the same character: depressed blue collar man with pent up violence and toxic masculinity, who usually thinks his wife is cheating on him. Anyways, I think any of them would have been really good on their own but it got really tiring feeling like I was reading the same story repeatedly. The Way Station was the story that stuck with me from this collection. The idea of a man being haunted by a city is so eerie and beautiful.

Nathan Ballingrud is an excellent writer who’s great at using supernatural elements to express emotional conflicts and societal issues. I just think he needs to find out about more emotional conflicts and societal issues. Anyways, it seems like NALM is the collection that’s gotten more recognition and fame but personally I’d recommend Wounds more.

I just finished this book, which I enjoyed more than expected (I liked it better than Mexican Gothic). I noticed something on page 180 that I suspect is a typo but if so, an unfortunate one! 

At that point in the book, the main characters have just met with Marisa Montero, supposedly the niece of Alma Montero. There are hints that Marisa is not what she seems, and it is later revealed >!that she is actually Alma, who has been using magic to keep herself from aging.!< This was not a particularly shocking twist, given the hints, but the biggest clue is that on page 180, there is a line thought by Montserrat that says: ""Her meeting with Alma had, despite her indifferent façade in front of Tristán, jolted her a little."" This refers to the meeting with Marisa and seems like a slip! Hard to imagine that this was missed in editing - but also not sure that the author would throw it in on purpose?

1711245891.0,Horror based on Shakespeare ,"I have just finished Macbeth: A Tale Of Horror by Stefano Ascari, a fantastic graphic novel based on Shakespeare’s Macbeth (as if that weren’t obvious). I loved how the Weird Sisters had a much bigger role than they do in the play and the artwork is wonderful. 

I was wondering if anyone knew of any other horror works based on Shakespeare’ writing. I know there’s a lot of romance stuff but so much of his work opens itself up to the darker side; Titus Andronicus is a horror story in and of itself. Even A Midsummer Night’s Dream could be considered rather sinister if you take into account that the apparently happy ending has Demetrius still under the influence of a drug that forces him to love a woman that he actually despises. If anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them. Doesn’t have to be graphic novels, I’m open to anything. Thanks.

However, I wanted to ask if anyone had any ideas about possible explanations for the supernatural events. I'm not talking about the dual entity of Elinor, Frances, and Nerita since I think these are simply half-human, half-sea creatures without needing much explanation. Instead, I'm referring to the room at the front of Elinor's house (where Genevieve's jewels appeared), the tangible appearances of John Robert DeBordenave and Mary-Love (and how they disappeared after Elinor's death), the events that led to Queenie's death, etc.  
I can't explain how completely supernatural events (objects appearing out of nowhere and tangible returns of the dead) can be associated with ""simple"" half-human, half-sea creatures. Perhaps the unsaid was intended to increase the mystery surrounding these beings, but if anyone has any ideas or explanations, I would love to hear them.

1711212773.0,Can (supernatural) horror be considered low fantasy? ,"Fantasy is one of my favorite book genres (along with horror) but I’m not a fan of having tons of fantasy elements in my fantasy. My introduction was ASOIAF/Game of Thrones, which aside from secondary-world stuff, is relatively light on fantasy/magic stuff.

I’m not a fan of most urban/modern-day fantasy because it’s like if there’s *any* fantasy then there needs to be minimum 10+ fantasy-checklist things on it. There’s no shortage of vampires in horror, but if it’s a fantasy book with vampires, then there needs to be werewolves and a couple other supernatural species, vampire hunters, a secret supernatural creature society, magical artifacts, etc. In *Let the Right One In*…it’s just a vampire. In Stranger Things, it’s basically just Eleven with powers and some demonic creatures. Not her going to a school with other kids with supernatural powers learning to use them against supernatural entities and finding supernatural items.

I do like modern-day (especially secondary-world) fantasy that’s super minimal on the fantasy, but they’re few and far between. It’s like either the fantasy is 1-2 or 7-10. Horror seems to have the low amount of fantasy/supernatural elements I enjoy despite typically being considered a separate genre. Stephen King books like Carrie, The Shining, and IT are good examples.

1711159586.0,Short stories/novellas for this genre.,"Hi everyone! I've been recently getting into some horror stuff though I'm not sure if the stories I'll be talking about are technically horror. I wasn't sure where to post this so hopefully you can help!! 

So for context I recently got into a bad reading slump after a bad read and a long book (though I enjoyed the latter but it had  a poorly paced later half). Both of these books were fantasy btw. 

After this I decided I wanted to read some short stories but as you'll see they have a similar feel but I'm not sure what genre it categories as. So far I've essentially thought it is either existentialism or human horror (idk don't ask).

Here are the books I've read:

- the metamorphosis
- the grand inquisitor 
- I have no mouth and I must scream
- repent harlequin said the tick tocker man
- the veldt
- the lottery
- the nine billion names of God
- (not fantasy/sci Fi or horror) fahrenheit 451 

I'm also currently reading the illustrated man and I also plan on reading dangerous visions. Again I'm not sure what genre these fall under but if there is anything similar to these books I would really appreciate it!!!

Thank you all!

1711157003.0,Recommendations for Existential/Epic/Cosmic Horror,"Topic.

I’m sorry in advance for the poor description but I’m looking for horror in the spirit of Event Horizon, Hellraiser, The Strain.

Recently I watched a show called “From” and it also captures what I’m looking for. Event Horizon is arguably not supernatural, but if it could be described as science fiction it’s certainly horrifying enough to fit the bill perfectly.

The Strain is also awesome. Especially with The Master being an ancient being, and biblical elements to it. Not a requirement by any means but that style.

The Stand by Stephen King, with its multiverse themes, kinda sorta fit the description but it’s just not scary. It’s also a virus…

Gods, aliens beyond comprehension, monsters or demons with unfathomable motive.

Again I know that’s kind of disjointed but trying to find “horror” books is such a wide range, and there’s so much stuff out there. I figured someone is into this type of horror for sure. I’m looking to build a list so by all means, overwhelm me.

Edit;

Thank you so much for all these suggestions please keep them coming. I have added everything to my list also added Hellbound Heart and Hollow Places just finished reading. Great one.",horrorlit

It's so unique and dark in a frequently humorous, twisted way. Being able to follow the protagonist, Vic, into her imaginative childhood and the harsh realities of adulthood and parenthood made me feel invested in her character, and her journey to kill off Charlie Manx was a wild ride. 

I was connected to all of the characters (Vic, Lou, Wayne) and thought that the villains were written so wonderfully (especially Bing Partridge! Thought he was worse than Manx. What a creep)

1711154459.0,Just finished My Heart is a Chainsaw,"Hello!! I just finished My Heart is a Chainsaw after almost two and a half months. I just want to talk about it because it was,,, I don't even know what word to use. It was a confusing experience just reading it. I don't know how I feel about it and I just want to talk to people about it. 

I started reading the book on the train back after winter break. Took a month and a half to hit 100 pages. I was complaining to a friend who hasn't read it and he told me ""literally just stop reading it."" I refuse to do that because I refuse to dnf a book unless it's BAD. He opened to a random page about 1/3 of the way through and told me if it didn't get good, to just drop it. I was trudging through it a lot less when I hit that point, so I didn't drop it. Finally finished it yesterday before class. 

I thought the opening scene with the dutch kids was funny. It was very reminiscent of white authors writing Latino characters and it was really funny seeing it happen to white people. I kept sending the dutch phrases to my dutch friend, who was practically having an aneurysm over how poorly done it was. Sorry to them and to all dutch people, but it was really fucking funny. Same thing with Ezekiel and the lake. It felt a lot like an ""ancient Indian burial ground"" subversion and that's probably intentional. I think we need to start pulling some of the racist tropes in books and movies and applying them to white people.

Jade was a little annoying, but I don't think I really mind? I just read another book with an even more annoying main character, so she was a breath of fresh air after that, believe it or not. I think I was more annoyed with how all over her place her suspicions were. Like a new suspect every few paragraphs, then stuck with one suspect for a chapter, then seven new suspects in a single paragraph. I know this is kind of just was horror movies are like. I think it's just the way Jade and her thought process was written. 

All of the death scenes were super, super fun. Especially that huge massacre at the end. 

I think I'd enjoy the book more if I didn't take so long to read it. I love the other Stephen Graham Jones' other works that I've read (TOGI, The Babysitter Lives, Earthdivers). From looking around this sub for a while, it seems like a lot of other people had a hard time getting through this book which is why I wanted to talk about it. I really just want to gather my thoughts and figure out how I really feel about it so I can write a proper review on Storygraph. 

Part of me wants to know if the sequel is worth it. I've personally noticed that every horror book or movie that references Don't Fear The Reaper is typically REALLY good. I like Stephen Graham Jones. I'm fine reading books that are mediocre. I'm just worried if I ask about it here, people will talk me out of it and I do really want to read it. 

But yeah. I just want to hear other people's thoughts and talk to someone else who has actually read it. ",horrorlit

One more thing I’d like to mention is my thoughts on how tons of readers hated the heavy use of politics, COVID-19, masking, vaxxing, and all that jazz in this novel to the point of being rude and mean to each other due to differences of opinion.  
  
As always, reading is subjective and everyone reads for different reasons. Some like the escapism of novels and want to stay away from anything involving world and political events. Others don’t care at all and welcome it for whatever reason. Some will DNF a novel the moment they see things like that because they completely disagree and get all worked up. Others will enjoy it because they agree with that side of the debate.  
  
Whatever the case may be, do whatever makes you happy as long as it’s not at the expense of treating others badly. It’s important to remember that if readers completely disagree with King’s views on politics, masking, vaxxing, etc., it’s okay to stop reading and move on to something else. Just please don’t start attacking your fellow Constant Readers because they agree with him on these kinds of topics or vice versa. We’re all readers at heart with different genres and topics we enjoy so no need to attack or be rude to each other over political differences or how people ultimately feel about COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc.  
  
In my opinion, King is 76 years old and will be 77 years old on 9/21/24. The fact that he is still writing novels at such a high level is nothing short of incredible. I’m just glad he is because he will forever be my all-time favorite author. Regardless of how you feel about his political views and opinions on COVID, masking, vaccinations, etc., if you are a horror reader at one point or other in your life he probably gave you at least one character or book you enjoyed based on something he wrote. He’s been writing for over 50 years now and is still going strong.  
  
These trigger warnings I mentioned above don’t bother me at all since they’re just words on paper to me. Remember my friends, be kind to each other, no matter where you stand on these political and COVID topics. Whether you agree or disagree, just treat each other with kindness. Trust me, it truly goes a very long way in life.  
  
Anywho, I loved this novel so much and I would consider it one of the best he's written if you go on this Holly journey. It was that extraordinary to me and just like the other novels featuring Holly, King did a wonderful job weaving a story within a story within a story with tons of little subtle references here and there.  
  
Everything from The Princess Bride, Blood Red Sky (I loved this movie on Netflix), Freddy Krueger, Carrie (lost my mind when he did this), and even The Haunting of Hill House all made me smile. I love it when King does things like this, especially with his legendary work.  
  
The intro to “Holly” was a wild one and my goodness, King dialed up the horror with a very gross twist to things in this one. I made lots of weird faces with those insanely descriptive situations. In general, I was so happy to see Holly get her novel and not only what she’s been up to lately but also how she has evolved in the grand scheme of things.  
  
To finally get more of Holly’s backstory and fill in the gaps to what makes her tick was such a great thing to read. I have connected with Holly way before this novel came out and reading this solidified to me that she’s a rockstar. I just love the kind of person she is, how vulnerable she can be depending on what is going on at the moment, and just how she figures things out over time.  
  
Seeing Holly continuing to be Holly as she pieced things together in this horror mystery novel was a lot of fun. The suspense is throughout this novel and besides Holly, I also enjoyed how King was able to include Jerome and his sister Barbara to also get updates on them which was nice to read. This is a big reason why I highly recommend reading those five novels I mentioned above since it’ll just make it more meaningful.  
  
Besides this incredible unique and disturbing story, King did a phenomenal job breaking down an underlying tone to “Holly” that was evident throughout this novel. Seeing Holly process grief due to what she’s going through was engrossing. Everyone handles grief differently but to see such a complex and riveting character as Holly goes through this on top of trying to figure out what she’s investigating was nothing short of brilliance.  
  
It goes to show that no matter how strong, weird, or complicated someone is on the outside, grief like that affects everyone to some degree even as they vehemently deny it on the inside. Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but I just loved seeing Holly turn into the person she is now. Not only am I impressed but well, proud. I know that’ll sound weird but I went through a five-novel journey reading them all in a single week and feel like I know Holly. Even King said in recent interviews promoting this novel that there is a bit of Holly in him and well, everyone. I also feel the same as I’ve seen some of my tendencies of handling things as Holly would which makes her so relatable to me.  
  
Another thing I loved is how the presence of Bill Hodges so many moons ago impacted Holly so much that it is still helping her in the present. I swear, the quote that King put to open up this novel (“Sometimes the universe throws you a rope.” - Bill Hodges) just hits you from beginning to end. Speaking of which, my goodness, the climax to the ending was fantastic! The main antagonists in this one were pure evil and I loved how Holly handled everything in stride towards that stupendous ending.  
  
I was on the edge of my seat getting through that ending because I didn’t think that would ever happen and to see Holly do what she did make me scream YES!!! so many times in my head because it was so epic. It was quite the buildup and everything ended perfectly. I loved the ending. Mainly because it ended the way it should have when it comes to Holly and the kind of character she has now become. As always with anything I read by King, I was left mesmerized as Holly is now one of my all-time favorite characters he’s ever created.  
  
I give “Holly” by Stephen King a 5/5 as it was so worth reading all the novels Holly was in before this one was published to enjoy watching her evolve into the person she is now. The horror, creepiness, and disturbing aspects of this novel were bloody magnificent. It probably isn’t a good idea to eat or drink anything while reading this one but at the end of it all, Holly rocks. I’m so glad King decided to give this influential character her novel because this has been quite the reading journey I will never forget for the rest of my life. Finally, the last little thing King left me with besides all this awesomeness involving Holly is that I will never look at vanilla ice cream the same again. Ever.",horrorlit

1711049105.0,Want to discuss with other people who have read Bunny (Mona Awad) (spoilers!!),"Yesterday there was a post asking for thoughts, if this book was worth it, but here I want to discuss with others who've read it. I just re-read it a couple days ago with knowledge of the plot twist

So Samantha is a majorly unreliable narrator, and the book gets meta and basically says it's open to interpretation. So I want to ask, how much do yall think actually happened and how much didn't? How do you make the things that supposedly didn't happen make sense?

I'm putting my questions/thoughts in a nice numbered list

1.  Was Max real, and if not, did he know Ava was a bird? Maybe he wasn't and it was actually Samantha who got revenge on the Bunnies in that way in workshop and was catfishing them all through text. But that wouldn't explain them all going crazy over Max when he actually showed up, if he didn't actually show up...
2. Did Samantha just have a bird and deer just kinda living in her house? Were those 2 different animals fucking??
3. It seems the Bunnies aren't as bad as they came across, they claimed to have tried to reach out to Samantha but she was the one who rejected them. Even then they still seemed to be pretty passive aggressive so. But their weirdness was probably over-exaggerated through Samantha's POV. Then again they kind of imply they killed Ava (an innocent bird) for Samantha's own good because she was delusional, so. Maybe they do just suck
4. I suppose when ""Rob"" came over, the Bunnies were pretending he and the other boys were there while only Samantha actually saw them. And she ""outsourced"" her own thoughts/internal conflict to him, when he was screaming at her before his head exploded
5. What exactly were the pills they kept pushing?
6. What was with Ava abandoning/ignoring Samantha for 2 weeks and not knowing why she'd be mad afterwards, especially if Ava wasn't even real? Perhaps Samantha just didn't see the swan around and then happened to see it that day, and imagined the whole conversation. Of course a bird has no concept of abandoning a person or knowing why that'd upset them
7. How did the Bunnies and Ava have a conversation in the diner? And then Ava and Eleanor having a conversation outside, was she just talking to a bird on her own?
8. What ever DID happen between Samantha and Lion? Maybe he wasn't even being weird/distant to her, but she was being weird/distant to him. Like how she rejected the Bunnies but turned it around in her head to them rejecting her
9. What actually went on in the Committee Meeting where Samantha was tied up by the hybrids if there were no hybrids? When the janitor ""freed"" her it turned out she wasn't all that tied up, so maybe nothing happened at all and she just made it up in her head
10. They were (or so they claim) just pretending turning bunnies into boys(hybrids), but were actual bunnies actually involved? Were they actually axe-ing bunnies? Or maybe just had them hopping around pretending they were ""hybrids"" for fun and Samantha made up the axe and exploding part

Honestly lots of things make more sense if these people could actually turn animals into people. And maybe they could, it's open to interpretation! So, what's yall's interpretations?",horrorlit

1710950533.0,Good/Bad audiobook narrators,"So I was recommended Mexican Gothic by somebody I known in person. I found it on Libby and rented it immediately. 

This narrator is the absolute worst and I don't think I can continue. I'm about 3 hours in with 7 or 8 to go.

She has the same inflection for every sentence and it is driving me nuts to the point im irrationally angry. I can't even belive its making me feel this way. Even if it's a two word sentence like ""She babbled"", the narrator does it in the same airy voice the exact same way as every other sentence.

Has anybody else listened to this book as opposed to reading it? I always have 1 audiobook and 1 physical book going at the same time and my physical book backlog is already miles long so I'll never get around to reading it.


Are there any other books you would highly recommend due to the narrator or any books you would not recommend due to the narrator? Would love a discussion about good/bad narrators


Top of my head, books I recall loving partly due to superb narration is:

11/22/63 - Stephen King

The Last House on Needless Street - Catriona Ward

The Exorcist - William Peter Blatty

1710947675.0,What are some of the best horror stories written by non white authors? ,"Been making efforts to broaden my horizons and read more variety. 


I’ve really enjoyed Tananarive Due (“the between” actually scared me, and I’ve enjoyed almost everything else I’ve read of hers). I also enjoyed Stephen Graham Jones, though his books didn’t scare me I really liked his writing style. And I tried some Octavia Butler, Victor LaValle, and P Djèli Clark. 

And I wouldn’t bill his stuff as horror, but I’m absolutely captivated by James Baldwin’s writing style. 

But it seems really tough to pin down reading recs from poc authors, specifically within the horror genre.

So what are some horror stories by non white authors that you’d highly recommend? 


EDIT: 

FIRST off, thank you to all these amazing commenters, and this incredible collection of recommendations! I've been trying to read more variety for the past year or so and any time I hit the library or book store asking for horror stories by non white authors, I pretty much just get blank stares. Librarians and clerks try to help, but the pool is so small (and under celebrated) that they're simply at a loss. You all have expanded my reading list by a couple hundred percents in mere days and I appreciate your recs!

SECOND:


several people have expressed bewilderment and confusion and what seems to be a sort of defensive accusation as to why I'd care about the race of the author... To be clear, this request is NOT anti white. I am white. 


If you're willing to be a little open minded, here are my reasons for asking for these recs:

A while back I learned that non white authors are statistically underrepresented in the US publishing markets, and this lack of representation is especially obvious within the horror genre.

As with many fields in the US there are socioeconomic barriers, or at least obstacles, to traditional publishing which POC face in disproportionately high degrees, as compared to white people. 


After learning about this inequity, I evaluated my own book lists on goodreads. My favorites were all white, in fact my broader reading list was also almost all white. And, incidentally, almost all men. 


As a white man, and a writer, this offended my sense of fairness. I love writing and dream of one day ""Making It"" as an author. But I don't like playing in a rigged system. 

I've always thought of myself as fairly socially minded and progressive, and informed.

To address the dissonance between my stated values and my oblivious reading history, I realized I had to expand my horizons. 

I decided to deliberately seek out works from authors who didn't look like me. I can't single handedly prompt a system wide change in terms of equity and inclusion in publishing. But I can damn sure put my meager dollars (and my time) towards leveling the playing field in terms of what books make it onto my shelf. 

So I'm looking for recs to make my reading base more diverse! It's been worthwhile so far as I've encountered perspectives that are new or challenging and in so doing discovered several new favorite authors!

tldr: if your knee jerk reaction to this innocent reading request is to get offended on behalf of white people, try to let go of that. I'm white and far more offended by the existing inequalities that would make a question like this not only controversial but necessary.",horrorlit

1710889720.0,The Haunting of Hill House: Show vs. Book (and general book discussion),"I know a lot of people say the book and show are nothing alike, but coming from the show to the book I feel like I noticed so many similarities and was hoping others felt the same. 

1. Eleanor Vance (EV) in the book seemed like a combination of Olivia Crain and Eleanor Crain Vance (ECV) in the show. The house gets in her head as it does to Olivia, but also it craves her and calls to her like it does to EV. 
2. I also think their endings are quite similar! The dancing, climbing up the stairs. For ECV this is the real end, but EV gets snapped out of it and ECV doesn't even realize what she's doing until it's too late. But they both experience that moment of regret when they realize it's truly the end. Also ECV comes back to Hill house as an adult because she was searching for something and felt like she had nothing at home, and that's how EV comes too
3. The biggest thing I felt like I couldn't untangle was how the show portrays time. I never got the ECV line out of my head ""our moments fall around us like rain"" and so I couldn't help but project that on to the book. The common explanations I see for the phenomena in the book is that it's either in EV's head, EV has some sort of telekinetic powers, or of course you can take it at face value that it was haunted by the ghosts of the Crains. In light of the show's explanation about time, what if the haunting was EV the whole time? Future ghost EV who would be trapped in his house for eternity was haunting (and taunting) living EV. 
   1. If you buy that, what if what Theodora saw when she told EV to run was Eleanor herself, having a picnic now that she was part of hill house 
4. I also liked the subtle connections, like the cup of stars, EV attachment to her mother's watch like ECV was attached to Olivia's necklace, the ""come home Nell in chalk"", I also liked how the part when EV listens on everyone conversations but not one mentions here is a good parallel to the show when little Nellie becomes invisible and is screaming but no one can hear her.

Just about the book

1. I was picking up how strange the dialogue was and how the characters seem to respond to Eleanor's thoughts (at first I thought this was because Theodora is somewhat psychic but then Luke started doing it too). I also picked up how they seemed to just start calling her Nell and Nellie one day pretty sporadically. She never mentions that as a nickname. Was that common enough in the 1960s that people just knew Eleanors were also called Nellie and I'm reading too much into it, or can that be seen as an example of them getting too connected to Eleanor?
2. The part when Eleanor is talking about ""surrendering"" to the house and Luke and the Doctor say she's been saying stuff like this before, was that a part that I missed or was it something the narrator never said? ",horrorlit
1710885786.0,Any cosmic horror recs? (Lovecraft is not preferred),"Just finished reading the Left/Right Game, and that ending just... man, that got me.

1710883667.0,Does Theme Music get better? ,"I'm about 60% in and I feel like the plot doesn't really have anywhere else to go. I usually am very good at guessing plots and the ends of movies and books (for example, I guessed that >! she killed the girlfriend !< from early on) and I love a good surprise, but literally every interesting way the plot could have gone but this seems to have been completely ruined by the plot ""twist"" of  >! Oh just kidding she was just coo-coo for Cocoa Puffs and just killed everyone herself. !< After that happened,  I really can't imagine anything else based on any foreshadowing in the earlier parts of the book that is compelling or interesting enough to make up another 40% of book. Maybe aliens are involved? 

My best theories were that >! Rory is actually her half brother because his father had an affair with Dixie's mom which resulted in baby Dixie but when the mom wouldn't be with him and witheld his child from him, he murdered her family and made the dad watch by cutting his throat so he could see them all while bleeding out slowly. There is one sentence early on where Rory says that his dad was more likely to go on a killing spree than Dixie's and that's why every time she and Rory tried to get it on it was weird or awkward, also the references of her being like his little sister, etc. !< 

Or that >! Ford killed them, based on how her aunt talks about him and how weird he is at the house, plus the thing about his father mysteriously dying from a cigarette in bed, and him violently hitting Dixie's dad when he brought it up. !< )

Does it get better? Are the ""twists"" worth it or should I go read the other reddit post that has spoilers for the ending. ",horrorlit

1710864960.0,Seven Cleopatra Hill was a jam-packed 5-Star horror novel that completely surprised me,"“Seven Cleopatra Hill” by Justin Holley is truly a jam-packed horror novel that takes the haunted house/motel style of writing to a whole new level. This was an exciting read from start to finish with excellent characters, scary encounters, and a ton of gore. This was a very well-written novel that I felt was a diamond in the rough when it comes to how many haunted houses/motels are out there. This one stands out from the rest and holds its own as a very unique take in this subgenre of horror.  
  
I loved all the unique characters as they were nicely developed with the kids being my favorite ones. Miles was by far my favorite character and he’s just a kid! All the creepy situations in this novel were built up and delivered a knockout of a horror reading experience. I particularly enjoyed the pacing of the story as nothing dragged on at all, every word mattered and in 30 chapters, there was zero fluff here.  
  
Don’t worry, I will not ruin anything for you as I want readers to be immersed and see all the different layers of suspense and horror that await. Even the gore in this novel added to the horror aspect of things as it was pretty tense in every encounter as things revealed themselves naturally. I had no idea where things would go and loved every minute of that feeling of not knowing what would happen until it was over.  
  
Also, I’m usually not into romance when it comes to the horror novels I read but it was done very well in “Seven Cleopatra Hill” where it wasn’t overbearing at all. It didn’t take anything away from the story and I appreciated that as it added more substance and drama to things.  
  
Once I hit the 80% mark, the race to the climactic ending was a fantastic journey as I loved how Holley was able to keep me on the edge of my seat as to what was ultimately going to transpire. The ending was beyond satisfying and a perfect way to wrap up this horror novel that will be one I remember for many years to come.  
  
This may come as no surprise but I give “Seven Cleopatra Hill” by Justin Holley a perfect 5/5 as he has a new fan in me. I look forward to reading his previous and future work as he’s an incredibly talented writer. If you’re looking for a great weekend horror novel that is all about demons, ghosts, creepy characters, blood, and a haunted hotel during an insane blizzard, this one is for you as I’d highly recommend it!",horrorlit

1710862515.0,Trying to track down a vampire novel I read in the early '00s.,"SOLVED. See edit below for the answer.

I'm looking for a novel from the '90s or early '00s in which vampirism is a disease or hereditary condition. 

* It's more suspense/thriller than horror or pulp. 
* I'm fairly certain gargoyles also figure into the novel in some way, but I don't recall whether they're alive or just symbolism.
* The dust jacket may have had a gargoyle on the cover, though I can't swear to it. 
* It's set in a present day city. 
* It may have involved porphyria.
* It absolutely cannot have been published any later than 2005.

Things I've ruled out: Charlie Huston, Brian Lumley, The Strain, V:tM books, Fledgling, and horror/urban fantasy in the Anita Blake/Buffy/Sonja Blue realm. 

Any help would be appreciated. I've been trying to figure this out for more than a decade now.

ETA:
It took digging through all the titles tagged ""vampires"" on ISFDb, but I think I figured it out: The specific scenes I could picture are from Elizabeth Kostova's The Historian, and the details that don't fit are probably from Andrei Codrescu's The Blood Countess or other vampire-related books I read at the time.",horrorlit

1710842419.0,Just finished Mongrels. My thoughts on the novel and Stephen Graham Jones.,"SPOILER FREE: 

&#x200B;

Okay so here's the deal: Stephen Graham Jones is an insanely polarizing author. People either love his work or they can't get through it. His writing style is extremely unique. 

&#x200B;

I view at like this: SGJ writes like people think. His prose follows internal narrative (from the books that I have read) and the narration will follow the plot and then branch off to a related thought that lasts almost pages at a time, and THEN brought back to the main plot written about. It's not necessarily stream-of-consciousness, its more of a ""oh hey I had this thought while writing this passage. There's a lot more to it and I'm going to keep going to finish out this thought. I'm not sure if it actually has to do with the narrative, but let me get back to what I was talking about"". And he does so without page breaks or dingbats; he regularly continues the narrative in the following paragraph. It's unapologetically disorienting. 

&#x200B;

But, that's him. He does his thing and at the of it says ""fuck it"". You like or you don't. 

&#x200B;

Now, I just finished ""Mongrels"". I'd like to state that I have read ""The Only Good Indians"", ""Night of the Mannequins"", and ""My Heart is a Chainsaw"". The first being superb; I read it in two days. I could not put it down. And then I got to the basketball match and the ending chase and was extremely disappointed. The first two acts were fucking fantastic, and then completely fizzled out during the basketball scene (I have since understood that basketball is huge within the indigenous community, still wasn't fun to read) and overly drawn out chase afterwards. 

&#x200B;

""Night of the Mannequins"" was a really fun novella surrounding an unreliable narrator (my favorite device). He did an excellent job with the small amount of space he occupied. 

&#x200B;

I felt ""My Hear is a Chainsaw"" was one of the most masturbatory pieces of fiction I ever read. Being a narrative from a teenager obsessed with horror movies, every two pages is riddled with slasher references. It's endearing at first, then she just continues AD NAUSEAM in referencing 'obscure' slashers (Holy fuck, you'll read an endless supply of Billy and Stu references). The narrative took about 200 pages to get anywhere; anything before it was analyses of classic slashers. It just felt like SGJ saying ""Hey look how much I know about these movies and what they actually mean"" rather than paying attention to the characterization and narrative (which he's usually very good at). I would have DNF'd it if I hadn't read it on a plane. Then end is kind of awesome and bonkers, but doesn't make up for the mundane first two-thirds.

&#x200B;

And now I just finished ""Mongrels"". It's a solid werewolf novel. It subverts a lot of previously established werewolf traits. The narrator is an adolescent expecting to turn werewolf and follows his aunt and uncle; two experienced werewolves. The whole novel kind of presents itself as a collection of vignettes of this teenager understanding all the attributes of being a werewolf before he shifts. It's endearing at first; as the reader we're exposed to a slew of unfamiliar characteristics of being a werewolf. But that's kind of the whole novel. Each chapter is the narrator at a different age experiencing something different. There's not really a whole narrative arc, if you will. It's more of a ""this is how werewolves live"". Which isn't really a bad thing, but it presents itself as a whole narrative following this family and fails to live up to it. And maybe that's the point? It feels like a giant metaphor for how Native Americans live in America today as outcasts and shunned. It's done well and not shoved down your throat. However, there's not really a narrative; it's about the characters. And god damnit, his characters are FANTASTIC. That's the reason I kept reading. I really wanted to know what happened to these outcasts. At the end of the day I won't care about your narrative unless you make me care about your characters, and he does a phenomenal job of making me give a shit about his characters. It's written well (he knows what he's doing), I read it in three days. Just don't go in expecting a central story, look at it as a documentary about a family of werewolves.

&#x200B;

I most certainly will not stop reading him, he has a great talent. His short stories are included in a myriad of Ellen Datlow collections. But he's not for everyone. And maybe that's what I appreciate the most: he's doing something different, unapologetically. ",horrorlit

I don’t want to name the author and put them on blast but I’ve noticed this with a few of the modern horror books lately.

I had heard so many good things about this author beforehand (even from this sub). I wish I would have read the reviews first because quite a few of people shared my perspective. 

Are they using AI to edit their work or something? Are editors pushed to the limit so much so that the work suffers from it? Or is this simply a writing style that I just don’t jive with? I’d love to hear if anyone else has experienced this because I felt like I was going crazy.

There is a book that possesses some kind of evil energy, so that once you start reading you can’t stop and must finish the book. Once you’ve finished the book you will claw your eyes out and die.

1710708624.0,Looking for a story, was read by Jason Hill (Horror Hill) a few years ago on YT but now I cant find it. It was about a guy who wrote a horror novel and a movie maker read it years later which made the author rich. He then gets emails from a teen who takes his books way too seriously and kidnaps/tortures/kills a girl to summon the demon from the books. When the author tells him the stories are fake the teen starts coming after him and ends up actually summoning the demon in the end. Its driving me crazy that I cant remember the name of the story.,horrorlit
1710703407.0,Something Similar to ‘The End Of Alice’ by A.M. Homes,"The End Of Alice might not be /horror/ lit so much as it is disturbing, but I think this is the best place to ask about it. 

I’ve read the novel about three times. It’s one of my favorite books ever. I love the way it dances between flowery romantic delusion and gory, gritty reality. I love how she uses prose. I’ve gone through two of her other works, but The End Of Alice seems to be the only one that sticks in the vein of being outright disturbing, which is the biggest appeal for me. I’m hoping someone here might have any recommendations for something similar in both writing style and the horror element? The pedophilic aspect I couldn’t care less about—just something horrific, with an unreliable narrator romanticizing the events would be incredible. 

I’ve already read Lolita, which didn’t appeal so much to me. Any recommendations would be massively appreciated!!",horrorlit

1710695192.0,Fairy Tale is an unforgettable novel where reality blurs into fantasy with a splash of horror,"“Fairy Tale” by Stephen King was such a delight to read, it’s something you just need to sit back, relax, and enjoy slowly in stride. I loved how as always with King, he brings you back to a time when you were a kid and had to deal with all the usual things kids dealt with. Relationships, sports, family, friends, doing stupid things, and just trying to make sense of it all.  
  
I loved all the characters King created in this novel. Charlie, Mr. Bowditch, Leah, and even the fantasy characters were all fantastic. Now, for me personally, when it comes to Radar, I became a dog owner for the first time in my life back in 2021 as she connected with me. I have a cockapoo by the name of Ozzy Skywalker and reading about Radar hit home for me in so many ways.  
  
All the interactions, situations, events, and descriptions were exactly that of a dog and how a dog owner would react. I can imagine if you’re also a dog owner, you will feel the same way as you connect immediately with the dynamic duo of Charlie and Radar and the adventures that await them.  
  
Don’t worry, I will not ruin anything for you but this novel is simply amazing. The way King blurred reality into fantasy completely blew me away. Even all the scary and horror situations were perfect that led to an awesome fairy tale story that was unique and just so good. The atmosphere, world-building, character development, and the pure creepiness of everything King built just really resonated well with me. Once I got to the 80% mark, it was incredibly hard to put this down to see what would ultimately transpire.  
  
Also, the illustrations for each chapter brought me back to my childhood as I remembered reading a lot of horror and mystery novels that did this. I have no idea who created these graphics for King in every chapter but they were great and captured the essence of each one. As I read, I’d often head back to see the image just to give me that visual as it happened. So well done!  
  
When it comes to the ending, it delivered after such a climactic buildup. I had no idea what would transpire but when it did, my goodness, it was wonderful and wrapped up an unforgettable novel. It was simply a perfect way to end things that left me beyond satisfied.  
  
I give “Fairy Tale” a perfect 5/5 and I highly recommend this novel to anyone who loves King, fantasy, horror, and wants to see what happens when both worlds collide.",horrorlit

I enjoy feeling scared but also with parts that are enjoyable - money, success, love, goals, friendship, etc. I want to feel excited and happy at times too.

1710645774.0,The Long and Hungry Road,"I haven't heard much from any community about this short story and I just want to give props to three author; Adrian Tchaikovsky, for creating a true Eldritch Horror story that is dripping with dread and horror told from the perspective of the Eldritch monsters. 

Most Warhammer novels are very hit and miss when it comes to quality but I do find most entertaining popcorn reading. This short story manages to really dive into the unknown, the horror, and the almost absent mindedness of an entity as it devours a world. It cuts to a few characters and their struggles before jumping back into the perspective of the Tyranids and how mundane their actions are. 

Please, if you enjoy Eldritch sci-fy horror please spend the $4 on kindle to read this story. It's amazing and I think more authors should try to emulate the perspective of the Tyranids in this book to add horror to their monsters. Also if you have any recommendations where the story has perspectives from the monsters please let me know.  I'd love to check them out. ",horrorlit

As an example, the above is the reason I loved the book version of the Shining so much- Jack's drinking problem and history of abuse was made worse by the supernatural influence of the hotel and the isolation of the setting made BOTH parts of the horror scarier (both being trapped with malevolent spirits who wish you harm AND being trapped with an abusive spouse/parent).",horrorlit

Quarter Book Check In

I am absolutely conflicted about Margaret, the main character. She reminds me of my mother, with all her language correction. At first I was kind of with her, as an agnostic millennial, if I had my dream house and it happened to be a little haunted, so be it! Fredericka seems like more of a blessing than a curse if you ask me. Can you imagine having a live in maid that you didn’t have to pay? A live in best friend too? 

I can’t seem to find the word for Margaret — aloof? Distracted? Unenthused? Her husband just DISAPPEARS and all she cares about is keeping her daughter Katherine away. She’s casually digging up bones to keep a prankster ghost away for a week. Is she hiding something? Great writing so far.

End of book thoughts
That was literally the best ending to a horror book I’ve ever read. Oh, my god. I don’t care if it sounds childish, a happy ending never disappoints. I found this book through a kind stranger on Reddit and they hit the bullseye. This is such a good read. Even though there wasn’t necessarily as much gore or incredible action throughout the first 3/4 of the book, I still found it held my attention firmly with the scares and twists it did give. I loved this book because I thoroughly expected the ending to be completely different than what it ended up being. Some authors don’t necessarily achieve that peak of anticipation that I was seeking, and this book did. If you love haunted homes, if you love ghosts with ghastly injuries displaying their moments of death, if you love weird characters that you fall in love with, this book is for you. I feel a little bad for doubting Margaret in the middle of the book. I really did want to think she was just insane. I could have accepted that ending. But what actually happened is so much better.

Questions & Highlights I had after finishing this book:
- Why wasn’t Hal present in the spirits at the end of the book while they chased out Master Vale? Is he in “hell” for being abusive?
- Why didn’t Jones die the same way as the other officers, the house choosing to spare her. Perhaps to tell the story?
- I wish I could listen to the song. You know the one.
- I can’t believe that McDouglas was going to shoot Margaret. What a loser.
- Do you think Fredericka will stay and roam the home after her “rest”? I’d like to think so. That even after she’d been freed, she’d still enjoy going about her daily routines.
- Katherine finally believe her mom.<3
- Needs must when the Devil drives.

1710600324.0,Woom is a wild and extreme splatterpunk ride that will leave its mark on you,"“Woom” by Duncan Ralston is just one of those short stories you have to read it to believe it. I love horror as it’s my favorite genre to read but when it comes to extreme horror, this one pushes the envelopes to realms that will offend readers.  
  
There is a TON of graphic and sexual violence here as this is not for the faint of heart. Don’t eat or drink anything as you read this because it’ll gross you out beyond words. Yeah, it’s that extreme, wild, unpredictable, and will leave its mark if you’re able to finish it. LoL there should be an achievement or something to finish reading this in its entirety because I have friends and even read reviews that “Woom” is so extreme that many couldn’t even finish it.  
  
It’s creepy, weird, gross, and beyond extreme that the ending was so unexpected I was completely shocked. I won’t ruin anything for you but once everything unfolds, you’ll also be making some weird faces as you read. It’s just too crazy, you know? I enjoyed all the cryptic chapters and it just really blew my mind that Ralston could come up with a short story that is so twisted and quick to read.  
  
I give “Woom” by Duncan Ralston a 4/5 and would recommend this to any reader that is looking for extreme, shocking, and crazy horror. It was very well written, had some nice twists, and the ending was pretty intense. The only thing I didn’t like was how this story had several mini-stories inside of it to explain characters, situations, and events with one I didn’t like.  
  
The majority were great but there was one I found a bit confusing and felt was a bit out of place. Aside from that, this was a solid read that I enjoyed and will remember for many years to come. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go take a long shower after reading everything that happened in Room 6 of The Lonely Motel.",horrorlit

I'm looking for things that a true ghost stories. I like haunted house and urban legend stuff like that. I also like those ""spooky"" psychological thrillers-- something like  ""Hide and Seek"" or ""Dream House"" (movies for reference). I generally do not like when real people are meant to be the scary part like slasher or murderer stuff, and Stephen King doesn't do it for me, to give a frame of reference on the opposite end.

My little review is a solid 3.5/5, loved the atmosphere, I think the way the scenery was described was almost the most effective part of the novel! In fact, I picked it up due to the cover selling it as a bit of a ranch horror. Harry and Sasha, at points, did slightly cringe me out lol. I also want to mention that pretty much all of the characters were very stereotypical but, for some reason, I absolutely enjoyed reading it. I think the enjoyment came from the atmosphere created and the imagery of these scenic mountains with secluded ranches and the ‘riding ponies and sippin beer on the porch’ kinda vibes e. I was a fan of the simplicity of the writing, too. I have been super busy and tired recently and having an easy read that still managed to be spooky and unsettling has been great for me!!

1710524801.0,What types of protagonist would you like to see more of in horror novels?,"I feel like a lot of horror books have similar types of main characters. Financially struggling college students/young adults, people who’ve experienced loss (often the death of a spouse or child), people estranged from their families, people trapped in abusive relationships, male protagonist who’s kind of a loser, etc.

And it makes sense. Horror and grief/struggles go hand in hand. There’s a lot to work with, but sometimes I want something else.

I recently binge watched Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, and I’d be extremely interested in reading about someone like Gus Fring or Lalo Salamanca dealing with supernatural evil, demons or gross fleshy tentacle monsters.

I’d be especially interested if the protagonist was female. Give me aggressive women who aren’t afraid to get violent. Maybe she’s a high level drug distributor involved or allied with the cartel. Maybe she’s a street level dealer, or maybe she’s a trailer park queen who’s been in her fair share of bar fights and knocked out people’s teeth. Maybe she’s just the school bully. I want female protagonists who are rough around the edges. Violent women exist in real life, and I think it’d be really interesting to read a book with one as the protagonist.

- Alan Wake 2 - if you played the video game I'm talking about Alan's part of the game, the dark, hard boiled neon-lit city, horrors lurking in the dark, the psychological turmoil and cosmic horror elements, cults (I LOVE cults)

-True Detective - season 1 of course. Everything about the show is I think my favorite piece of media ever. The insanely gripping atmosphere, the serial killer, Carcosa (Yellow King reference), all of it is perfect

- The Cthulhu Mythos - specifically the Shadow Over Innsmouth story is just... The unknowable looming terror, the paranoia, madness, fog filled fishing town that harbors a deep dark secret. I only read the Crhulhu Mythos so any other suggestions are welcome

- Se7en - perfect movie by David Fincher, absolutely devours you with the atmosphere and the music, the ritualistic killings in a rainy seedy city, what's not to love?

I think you can see a common thread. I can dig it realistic or supernatural, but atmosohere and a good driving mystery is the most important (if it has rituals and cults you can bet your bottom I'll check it out)

I hope i cam get a few recommendations and I appreciate all input!",horrorlit

But does anyone else find a disconnect when people say that X book terrified them or had any other strong emotional reaction?

(Also a mini-gush about John Langan)","I've been searching for some genuinely scary books and I keep searching this sub for these types of posts, but they're always filled with books I've either read or definitely heard about.  


So. What's a book that scared the hell outta you that you feel is either obscure, unknown, underrated, under-recommended or not really ever recommended?  


I'll go first: while this author is certainly not unknown especially in this subreddit, John Langan (author of The Fisherman) has written a ton of short stories. I recently learned that most, if not all of them are published on ebook. I'm reading the collection The Wide Carnivorous Sky and a story in there genuinely scared the shit out of me. ""The Day Runs Down"". There are 2 reasons why, on paper, this story shouldn't be scary for me: 1) it's a play script and 2) it's about zombies. But my GOD. It was truly effective and filled me with all kinds of dread, horror and terror.

I have recently started reading mostly horror books but I haven't actually tried any horror audiobooks. When reading horror books I usually only get scared if I'm reading alone in the dark or in a similar atmosphere. Are audiobooks as scary as actually reading the book? I doubt I'd get scared listening to a book while washing the dishes or vacuuming in broad daylight.

1710485890.0,The Devil Takes You Home by Gabino Igelsias. Just finished. A bit disappointed. SPOILERS,"Bought this one a while ago because it came up in multiple ""books like True Detective"" threads in this sub. 

**Positives:**  The occult, the cartel, and the region's centuries long history of ritualistic violence and suffering seems to go untapped in horror lit and horror movies, so glad to see someone tackle it.  

Iglesias did an *impressive* job taking a normal guy, tragically having his daughter suffer, have him resort to crime to financially prevent her suffering, his crimes escalate to murder, his daughter dies, he abuses his wife for the first time, she leaves him and he is left with nothing all in under *20 pages* with me believing it all and feeling for the main character. *Very* well done. 

**Other than that:**  What am I missing here? Why is this being compared to True Detective?

It's an incredibly violent story but at the end nobody is redeemable or likable. It's ultimately kind of pointless other than the thrill of the violence and betrayal.

There also seemed to be an underlying self-hatred coming from the characters and the author himself, similar to Roberto Bolano's *2666*, but Bolano at least was up front about it. He was very candid about his home country being unrecognizable and wasn't the place he loved and remembered growing up in.

**Lastly:**  Post-Trump racism was a huge part thematically but seemed to just fall flat. I kept expecting the tables to turn but they never did. The white guys in the book are racist assholes but they never actually *do* anything bad. The other characters talk about how bad they are, but they themselves and the people they're associated with do far more horrific things. Which brings me back to Bolano and wondering if something went over my head?",horrorlit

1710459185.0,“The Good House” is one of the most original haunted house/voodoo novels I've ever read,"“The Good House” by Tananarive Due is a slow-build kind of novel that builds up into a solid haunted house novel that checks off most of the boxes you’re looking for when it comes to this kind of horror. If you want to read about evil spirits, voodoo, and some pretty memorable characters and events, you’ll genuinely enjoy this one.  
  
This was the first novel I’ve ever read by Due as I love her writing style. All the characters are well done, places across Sacajawea were very descriptive, and of course, the center of this, the house itself, were all great. There is a ton of creepy horror here and even though I won’t ruin it for you, there are plenty of moments that will creep you out.  
  
I also loved all the Stephen King novel references as that was a nice touch as he’s my all-time favorite author. Besides all that, I did feel this novel could have been trimmed down just a bit more as some of the dialogue and situations were a bit repetitive. It starts slow, builds up nicely, then starts to level out as I kept waiting for more horror and big events to happen. Once they eventually did, I felt it took a bit too long to get there.  
  
The different layers to the overall story arc were all brilliantly written. I enjoyed how the chapters kept going back and forth from the past to the present with major events happening and then reading about what happened to fill in the important gaps. Again, it’s extremely hard to write this in a way that doesn’t feel confusing or annoying. I give much respect to Due for writing this to where it just all makes sense, especially with a wild, tension-filled ending that was fantastic.  
  
Overall, I give “The Good House” a 4/5. It’s a memorable horror novel with the only knock on it being I felt this could have probably been cut by 100 pages and still delivered an amazing reading experience. Either way, I genuinely enjoyed it and would recommend this to anyone looking for a good haunted house novel with a voodoo twist.",horrorlit

1710449733.0,Seeking adventure-fantasy-horror recs!,"So, I’ve just read The Nighthouse Keeper by Lora Senf, the sequel to The Clackity.

I’m looking for similar books- all of the ones I’ve mentioned are DEFINITELY horror, but they also have some extremely cool and almost cozy other-world fantasy quest vibes- think A Wrinkle In Time, actually, which certainly has horrific stuff in it. I know many recs like this will be MG or at least YA, which I’m totally open to. 

The last element I loved about these books is the emphasis on horror reflecting the protagonist’s mental state or obstacles they have to overcome. In This Appearing House, the obstacles our MC encounters are related to her accepting and acknowledging her cancer diagnosis, and in Senf’s Blight Harbor series we see our MC grow more confident as she battles manifestations of her anxiety.

1710448885.0,Fantasticland thoughts (spoilers),"I just finished Fantasticland after seeing it recommended here a lot and it was right up my alley. I especially liked that any SA was implied and though I definitely think it occurred, the threat and implications were more than enough considering the heavy gore otherwise. Most discussions of the book on here are pretty old so I’m making a new post in case anyone is willing to discuss a few things with me beyond the posts about the warthogs that seem to crop up quite often. 

First thing that stuck with me was small but (I felt) interesting- Riley’s hostility toward Cristobal (according to Cristobal). I thought this was an effective and subtle way of emphasizing the wild group affiliations, since he was technically a joiner rather than a member. Also, coming right after Jill’s section, it gives us a (possibly more realistic) view of the Deadpool’s leadership, since Riley’s attitude and choices result in many, many more casualties than, say, Elvis’s leadership. Some of this is geographical obviously, but it’s also evident that things would have played out differently for the Deadpools if they had a leader like Elvis. It feels like there are parallels between Riley and Clara’s leadership, with maybe the women leaders feeling more at risk and reactive to the Pirates threat on account of the way the violence is gendered (“how much for the girl?”- girls going missing- Elvis’s girlfriend’s murder- etc). Because of this, the women leaders stoke the fire started by Brock, while Elvis and Glenn seem less reactive and more defensive. 

The other thing I wanted to discuss is that I disagree with the criticism that Brock’s character is flat. I actually felt the book does a great job showing how infectious the atmosphere of the Pirates would be, a chance to alleviate fear through shared purpose and action. Brock understands how to commandeer and manipulate people. I didn’t think the interview portion with him was necessary but the way he shows up and is portrayed in the various other stories was great.

1710428866.0,Having a hard time finishing Return to the Black Farm,"I just started reading this after finishing the Black Farm not too long ago. The problem I'm having is that the main character comes off stupid and selfish. So much so that it's frustrating to me that he doesn't understand the ramifications of actions and how short sighted it is.

The idea that the MC and his wife have just learned about the existence of heaven and hell as well as a demiplane of purgatory just set aside for the suicidals and simply go back to normal is baffling. Not to mention literally every problem is solved by a threat or a basic act of violence.

Dude toppled a demiplane of existence disrupting a cosmic balance and is just like ""not my problem"" after fundamentally being explained to that it is his problem is the point I put it down.

1710391383.0,Just finished Baby Teeth by Zoje Stage..?,"Let me start off with this, I really enjoyed this book. I might spoil it, so don’t read on if you plan on picking up this book. 

I enjoyed reading this, but I’m confused about a few things and wondered if other people noticed them.

Firstly, I felt like Hanna’s intelligence was inconsistent. I don’t exactly know how to explain this, because I know the idea was that she’s much too smart for her age. But there were just times where I got the feeling she didn’t understand certain things for the plot’s sake. It was obvious enough to be annoying. 

Secondly, Suzette was not a great mother, but again the damage done to Hanna felt inconsistent to her behavior. She had a deep, burning hatred for Suzette that wasn’t earned in my opinion. I don’t know if the author was trying to insinuate that there was something deeply wrong or that Suzette caused it? I was confident it was a mixture of both, but near the end of the book I couldn’t help side with Suzette. 

Some of the most frustrating parts: why not just videotape Hanna without her knowledge? Did Hanna HAVE to have unwavering hatred for her mother simply existing at all times(it got annoying)? I can forgive Alex for not believing his wife(just one person), but every school and baby sitter was lying too?? The constant back and forth competition Suzette was having with a 7 year old to win some dumb fight that wouldn’t even benefit her! 

Lastly, the ending felt abrupt to me. Like Stage was leaving it open for a sequel. I’m not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn’t that Hanna would be stuck at Marshes. 

I would love to hear how you guys interpreted the book and maybe could clear up any of my confusion?

P.s. I sympathize with both characters. Obviously, Hanna learned to mask her behavior from her mother. But I believe Suzette was valid in wanting her marriage to be the way it was before. ",horrorlit

1710300052.0,I read 57 books in 2023 and 30 of them were recommended by this sub,"I'm so happy to have found this subreddit. It has introduced me to some great books and in turn great authors. Most of the others on my list were Stephen King, which I think fit the genre, but I think he gets more than enough attention.



Books I'd highly recommend:

House of leaves - M Z Danielewski: I haven't read anything like it. The use of text was done in a way that didn't feel gimmicky and the story was good. It felt a little slow to start but had me hooked.

Sour Candy - K P Burke: This story was out there. I loved it. Crazy, creepy, and unpredictable. It made me want to read a lot more of his work. His style is entralling and with his story length nothing drags on too long.

There is No Antimemetics Division - Qntm: This one was wild. I wasn't as familiar with SCP, but I immediately wanted to know everything about the universe created. It kept me guessing and thought it was very well done.

Penpal - D Auerbach: One of the creepier books I've read and its presented in a way where I was dying to know more. I saw a spoiler about half way through and still thought it was great.

Winterset Hollow - J E Durham: Starts calm but then takes a turn in the best way. Not what I saw coming, and one of those times where you might not necessarily be on the side of the main characters

We Have Always Lived In The Castle - S Jackson: Jackson is excellent at short and unsettling. It still felt like a slow burn despite the length. I knew the ending, but still had an impact.

Migrations - C McConaghy: Bleak and depressing but well done. Not the ending I thought was coming but it all stuck with me for a bit after reading.

The Ruins - S Smith: Tense and claustrophobic for a setting thats almost entirely outside. I thought it was pretty unsettling at times and a lot of scenes really worked.

Last Days / No One Gets Out Alive / The Ritual - A Nevill: These have a but, however I liked them enough that they're still in this section. All of them are borderline scary for me and I was on the edge of my seat ... until the last section on all of them. They go off the rails and don't really recover for me. Still worth it.

Tender Is The Flesh - A Bazterrica: Love the idea. I think it was over hyped in terms of shock factor, but it was still intense. The ending still got me.

A Short Stay In Hell - S L Peck: Amazing. Short but powerful and another one I still think about. It gets a lot of praise on here and it's well deserved. Great concept. Great execution.

Between Two Fires - C Buelman: Overrated and Underrated. This was one of my favorites of the year. It was a beautiful book that hit in a way I wasn't expecting. Made me buy more of his work.

The Exorcist - W P Blatty: Great story. A classic for a reason. However, much like seeing the movie decades after its release, the scare wasn't completely there for me. I wanted it to be the book to really scare me this year but alas, maybe next year.



Books I'd recommend, but ...:

Survivor Song - P Tremblay: I love a good outbreak story and this was an intetesting take. I like Tremblay's style and his books are quick reads, but the main character gets a bit grating.

Cabin At The End of The World - P Tremblay: Great concept but it drags a bit. I would have expected a better ending with the way it lingers, but a little unsatisfying. Overall a good enough read though.

A Head Full Of Ghosts - P Tremblay: Similar to the others, a quick read and very interesting, but the blog is pretty annoying. I didn't want to skip anything but it probably wouldn't hurt.

The Kraken Wakes / The Day of the Triffids - J Wynham: Really interesting reads. Great plots with a different take on things. Even though they were short, I felt like they dragged a bit. Might be preference but I found them a bit harder to get through.

Swan Song - R McCammon: I'm a big fan of post apocalypse and this one kept me hooked for the 900+ pages. It felt a little after-school-special where the stakes don't seem to be there and it makes it feel like The Stand Lite.

Dark Matter - S J Patrick: Great concept and an interesting read, but I felt like the plot meandered a bit. It went a way I wasn't expecting, which isn't bad, just different. Worth a read, but I feel like it started strong and dipped.

The Troop / The Deep / Little Heaven - N Cutter: I enjoyed them all. They were creepy and captivating. Not a fan of animal abuse and all of them have it in some way. The endings missed the mark for me a bit. It feels like Stephen King Lite with similar issues with some of his endings.

Bird Box - J Malerman: One of the few times I feel like the movie got pretty close to the book. Its a concept that works really well visually, but reading it was still eerie.

A Simple Plan - S Smith: Not purely horror but maybe horror adjacent. It was a fast paced thriller with a few twists that kept my attention. Not The Ruins but really not bad.

The Road - C McCarthy: Definitely bleak and hopeless and a harsh reality. The formatting takes getting used to but I thought it was decent overall. A little overrated in my opinion, but your results may vary.

The Radium Girls - K Moore: Tragic story and both shocking and not surprising. Brutally real and a interesting read. Stayed a little past its welcome for me but ultimately kept my attention throughout.



Books I wouldn't recommend:

Amityville Horror - J Anson: The content was unsettling. I wish it was presented better. It felt like an article about the events, which in some cases could be effective, but I feel like it was flat and the opportunities for some creepy scenes were missed.

Hell House - R Matheson: There was some tense, unsettling scenes. But the overall plot lost me a bit and there were definitely some sections that were unnecessarily sexual.



Others:

Aside from Stephen King, I read some Gaiman and Crichton. Of these I'd recommend Coraline, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, Tgw Graveyard Book, and Airframe. Gaiman's stories are beautiful and haunting. Crichton's feel like a movie.

after I read Gerald’s Game, I was thoroughly creeped out, and then after hearing from multiple people that Pet Sematary was one of the scariest books they ever read, I decided to give it a try. Pet Sematary itself was low on my list because I was pretty ignorant about the plot and thought >!it was just a novel about zombie animals, what’s so scary about that?!<

well wow, I was so wrong. I was fucking scared, lol. for the first time in my life I had dreams about a horror novel while I was reading it. it is so much more than a scary book to me. well, not your typical horrors… >!but about the terrors of grief and how we choose to deal with it.!< I was incredibly scared throughout most of my read but by the time I finished, >!I just felt so, so sad.!< I think this book will stick with me for a while.

1710271678.0,Can we talk about how shit Out There Screaming is?,"I was so hyped for this book. I love Jordan Peele. All three of his horror movies are amazing. I was so excited that he was releasing an anthology  ook of curated horror stories.

So far, the best part of the book has been the introduction that he wrote, because these stories are genuinely awful. The first one is especially bad. It feels like it was written by a horny edgy teenager, trying to write his own Patrick Bateman. The story that comes after that is shit. The twists are so lackluster and the stories are so generic.

This feels like such a cash grab. There's no way that Peele ""selected"" these stories. They just slapped Peele's name of this as an afterthought I think.

Dude was it political though. Don't get me wrong I really appreciated the metaphor and it felt more realistic in today's political climate. But even so the weaponized ignorance and ""useful idiots"" rhetoric made it scarier in my opinion. Made it seem like it really could happen.

Im not surprised at the divisive reaction for his writing style (or the unanimous dislike for the audiobook accents!).

One thing that has not really been discussed here is the subtext of motherhood in the Reddening. Kat is supposedly unable to conceive thanks to a bout of chlamydia, and is presented as a bit of an under achiever until her encounter with the Creel cult. By the end she is no longer jealous of Helena and is pregnant.

Helena survives her attempted drowning at sea thanks to her determination to see her daughter again.

Finally it is the Mother figure of the cult who seems to be central to the relationship with the Creel, hinting that she has been granted longer life in return for sacrificing her husbands younger mistresses.

My take was that the ‘Reddening’ had curative properties but also at the expense of unleashing your inner savagery.

1710257526.0,I read 11 books in the past few months and here's a review of them all!,"Sorted lowest to highest:

**Title:** [Cold by Drew Hayden Taylor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125120532)

**Oversimplified plot:** What possible connection could a university professor, hockey player, detective, and plane crash survivor have?

**Sub-genre:** thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** Below them, the sparse forest was deathly silent and still, a condition brought on by weeks of torturous cold that hugged the rough terrain.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** A somewhat exciting start, followed by a very, very boring middle, and capped off with a rushed and predictable ending. The author mentions in the acknowledgements that this story was originally written for a movie and it is blatantly obvious in the writing style.

---

**Title:** [Last to Leave the Room by Caitlin Starling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65213922)

**Oversimplified plot:** Inexplicable geological phenomena + potentially correlated doppelgänger.

**Sub-genre:** sci fi

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** Dr. Tamsin Rivers stands in the abyss.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** This was quiet the frustrating read. The concepts, while not novel, are fascinating and done in a unique way. The main issue I found was the inconsistent pacing. A third of the book had me enthralled, a third of the book was fine, and a third of the book was a slog. And the weirdest part was that each of these thirds were spread out all over the book, so it's not like I can even say ""It started out strong but ended poorly."" The other issue with this book is that it just has soooo many tropes that I personally dislike. For example, the arrogant, cruel, and opportunistic scientist is a trope makes me roll my eyes every time I see it.

---

**Title:** [The Turning by A.L. Masters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59548079)

**Oversimplified plot:** Office mundanities disrupted by global pandemic - zombies.

**Sub-genre:** zombies/apocalyptic

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** The overwhelming stench pervaded the freezing air of the office.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** While the overall plot is interesting the characters are distractingly obnoxious and make really frustrating decisions.

---

**Title:** [I Can See Your Lies by Izzy Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205839109)

**Oversimplified plot:** She can see lies.

**Sub-genre:** Mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** From the author: >!Murder, Violence, Domestic Abuse!<

**Opening Lines:** The scarlet pool expanded over the rug, widening, consuming.

**Rating:** 2/5

**Review:** This novella started off really promising: I loved the pacing, I loved the premise of being able to see lies, the characters felt fairly strong despite knowing them shortly. However, about halfway through, the plot began to lose direction, the namesake concept stopped carrying any weight, and my connection to the characters dwindled. Unfortunately, pretty disappointed overall. (I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.)

---

**Title:** [Metaxysm by R.E. Holding](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202537553)

**Oversimplified plot:** New inventor creates something out of her control.

**Sub-genre:** sci fi

**Bechdel Test:** Fail

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** Circle Point. A posh, well-known apartment complex for septuagenarian settlers that boasts a peaceful quiet.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** To enjoy this novel you will need a large amount of suspension of disbelief and to come to peace with characters making very stupid decisions. The plot is interesting but quickly goes off the rails and the characters felt like so close to being fully developed but were missing a tiny little push. However, I will say that I really, really enjoyed the author's writing style. There are many passages in here that made me pause and reread it. Overall, I think this author shows a lot of promise and I'm excited about what she writes next. (I received an advance review copy for free, and I am leaving this review voluntarily.)

**Title:** [Island Witch by Amanda Jayatissa](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157979441)

**Oversimplified plot:** Daughter of a traditional demon-priest—relentlessly bullied by peers and accused of witchcraft herself—tries to solve the mysterious attacks that have been terrorizing her coastal village.

**Sub-genre:** historical fiction/supernatural

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!child abuse, sexual assault, incest, suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** Blood coursed through him like a rich nectar I wanted to lap up.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This was honestly an exhausting read. The amount of shit the main character goes through is just obscene. The setting is rich and colorful and raw with sprinkles of fantastical elements. It's deceptive because the reality is that this is a super bleak story. If this doesn't get you feeling some type of way then I don't know what will. Depressing, horrible, awful. Just what I love in horror.

---

**Title:** [Holly by Stephen King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/65916344)

**Oversimplified plot:** What do these octogenarians have to do with so many mysterious disappearances?

**Sub-genre:** mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** Nothing major.

**Opening Lines:** It's an old city, and no longer in very good shape, nor is the lake beside which it has been built, but there are parts of it that are still pretty nice.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** Octogenarian antagonists?! Hell yes! The conceptualization of the characters were really, really interesting and enjoyable to me. There were some aspects of the plot that I thought were unnecessary (like the focus on a couple side characters), but overall this was a very streamlined book with a surprisingly satisfying ending.

---

**Title:** [Fever House by Keith Rosson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66087060)

**Oversimplified plot:** A severed hand that induces madness is the last thing a leg breaking thug expects to find when collecting overdue money.

**Sub-genre:** Fantasy-ish? Supernatural, maybe?

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!Suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** Tim Reed sits in the driver's seat of his ancient and rust-punched Datsun hatchback, balancing a screwdriver on the tip of his finger.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** This book defies literary conventions in the best way possible, turning potential pitfalls into its most compelling features. The novel's ability to start with a focused plot and then expand into an ever-broadening tapestry is nothing short of masterful. The author skillfully navigates multiple perspectives, including some that are wildly unconventional, to keep us both grounded and on the edge of our seats. What might normally doom another novel—introducing key characters halfway through, flipping throwaway characters into central roles, and alternating between chaotic settings and the mundane backstories of seemingly insignificant characters—becomes the backbone of this story's success. I fucking love this novel. I will reread it. I will dream of it.

**Opening Lines:** I love Thursday nights.

**Rating:** 3/5

**Review:** Get ready for a shock and awe experience. The pace is breakneck with a ton of twists (shock) and the concepts are fascinating (awe). However, if you slow down and sit with it for a bit, you'll start to notice the many flaws. The narrative has some significant plot holes. But more importantly, the characters feel underdeveloped, serving more as plot devices than as fleshed out people. Despite all that, I had fun reading it. And if you wanna turn your brain off and just go for a ride, this is the perfect novel for you.

**Title:** [Six Wakes by Mur Lafferty](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28962996)

**Oversimplified plot:** Clones awake in a space ship to find their previous bodies murdered.

**Sub-genre:** sci-fi/mystery/thriller

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!suicide!<

**Opening Lines:** Sound struggled to make its way through the thick synth-amneofluid. Once it reached Maria Arena's ears, it sounded like a chain saw: loud, insistent, and unending.

**Rating:** 4/5

**Review:** This is a solid sci-fi mystery with an interesting concept and a well-executed plot. I found this novel to be entertaining and really enjoyed the pacing. There is a natural ebb and flow of tension that neither leaves you exhausted nor bored and weaves in each characters past with the horrors and challenges they are currently facing. I also appreciate that this isn't just a murder mystery with a sci-fi set dressing; the science fiction is enmeshed in and pivotal to the plot.

**Oversimplified plot:** Teacher seeks revenge on the students that killed her daughter.

**Sub-genre:** Thriller/mystery

**Bechdel Test:** Pass

**Content Warnings:** >!suicidal ideation, child abuse, child death!<

**Opening Lines:** Once you finish your milk, please put the carton back in the box.

**Rating:** 5/5

**Review:** I've said it before and I'll say it again, I love revenge stories! This one just blew me out of the water. First of all, one of the best POV switching out there. Masterfully done, no notes. Secondly, you know this story is going to be good when each chapter your eyes slowly get wider and wider and it ends with your jaw being on the floor. Each chapter!! And finally, how is it possible that I thought the first chapter told the perfect revenge story and yet there were 5 more to go?! I love this book.

1710191985.0,The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires is a must-read for vampire lovers everywhere,"“The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires” by Grady Hendrix is a hell of a ride. I’ve read Hendrix before and also enjoyed “The Final Girl Support Group” very much as his writing style, character development, plot twists, and all the creepy/scary situations are done very well.  
  
For this novel, if you love vampires and want a scary, vulgar, modern story that gives you major “‘Salem’s Lot” vibes, this checks all those boxes and then some. Everything from the main protagonist, Patricia, to the eventual villain you’ll encounter, made for an extremely memorable read. I enjoy reading vampire novels and this is right up there with one of the more unique ways to tell a compelling story that hooks you right from the start to a wild ending.  
  
Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but this is one of those hard-to-put-down horror novels. Some scenes and situations make you cringe, look away, re-read, and wince. The way Hendrix fleshes these certain situations out is so horrific that you’ll be on the edge of your seat leading to a beyond-satisfying conclusion. The buildup and momentum going into the ending were fantastic!  
  
I give “The Southern Book Club's Guide to Slaying Vampires” a perfect 5/5 as I’d consider it a must-read for anyone who loves vampires, gore, blood, and just what a Southern ladies' book club would do if this ever happened in real life. That’s what I loved the most about it as it all felt believable which added to the overall immersion of a high-quality horror novel.

I'll admit in the beginning I didn't think I was going to like it. The main character and his friends seemed too cookie cutter at first, and their banter honestly made me think they were not that smart. However, even though I knew the book was going to be dark, it kept getting darker and darker with each page, and I the twists were not what I expected them to be. This novel kind of felt like The Wickerman meets Midsommar because everything looked so fairy tale on the surface, but when years of torture and hurt turned into years of revenge and more violence madness ensued and no one was left feeling redeemed, whole or complete.

1710106743.0,"“Mexican Gothic” thoughts, without spoilers","Just finished reading Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia, first published in 2020. I picked it up after finding it on some random “best horrors list”, and because of my general interest in Mexican culture.

For the “Mexican” aspect, I must say I’m disappointed at least. Judging from the title and authors heritage I was hoping for at least some Aztec, Mayan or other pre-Colombian belief woven into the story. The main character, a very young woman from Mexico City travels to a remote village to check on her cousin, who married a heir to an old, formerly wealthy family, coming from England.

The whole setting draws (at least for me) from Poe-esque gothic novel, not adding a lot on top of it. The Mexican part of the novel ends with the entrance to the Victorian house of Doyle. All the dialogue is explicitly in English, ripping the placement from any area on Earth.

I’m not sure where the scares were supposed to come from. The dream sequences try to push the mystery forward, they don’t add anything to the atmosphere though. Some occasional gore feels weirdly out of place, neither adding to the horror nor being disgusting enough to be memorable.

I’m not “canceling” the author. I am really curious about her anthology Daughters of Cthulhu, hopefully they can deliver without promising too much.

1710098395.0,A Review of “From Below” by Darcy Coates - The Power of Environment in Horror Genre (without spoilers),"Firstly, I want to point out that horror is a genre I read only rarely but after reading through several fantasy series, I was desperate for a change in genre. As a result, I am certainly not the best judge of the quality of a horror themed novel. Nevertheless, the book left me wanting to write a review so let's hope it's worth a penny.

The book opens up with **a team of divers and filmmakers preparing to explore the insides of a long lost ship SS Arcadia**. The tensions between the team members are subtle yet tangible and so are their doubts and fears which provides a nice basis before the diving even begins. Each of the characters has nuances and secret goals. They form an intriguing group of characters while also having distinct personalities. Throughout the book, it is easy to grow fond of the whole team and by the end, it is difficult to not wish for all of them to survive despite their shortcomings and disputes.

The novel switches back and forth between the main story and the accounts of the last days of SS Arcadia before its downfall which creates a nice pacing and builds up suspense on two fronts while also offering a room to breathe.

What makes this book a truly thrilling read, however, is **the frightening power of the dark underwater environment.** Swimming through the deep dark waters with little lighting, with the ever-present consciousness of having a limited supply of air, being surrounded by the tight spaces of a surprisingly well preserved shipwreck and hearing sounds which the wreck should not be emitting. Seeing things which are impossible to explain, hoping that it is only your mind playing tricks on you. Darcy Coates takes advantage of these environmental aspects to the fullest and intertwines it brilliantly with the **mental struggles** that sprout alongside it. I felt fear crawl down my spine just reading about the unforgiving nature of this dark domain.

**The supernatural elements** are slowly but surely creeping into the story and eventually **join forces with the environmental horrors** which never truly disappear. Combined together, these elements create a truly engaging read.

If I had to slightly criticize the novel for something then it would be its length. The team undergoes a few separate dives and I did feel like one dive less would have been perfect for the length as the “break” between the last two dives did lower the tension and feeling of urgency a bit.

To conclude, I enjoyed *From Below* so much that I even pushed myself into writing a review and that says something. Till the very end the book keeps you on the edge wondering whether someone's existence will have to end so that everyone else's can be preserved. I cannot recommend this novel enough and have to praise the use of environmental horror especially (but it wouldn’t be enough without an enjoyable set of characters).

I would appreciate some recommendations for horror novels where the environment plays a big part. I can imagine that environments such as dark forests, deep caves, frozen mountaintops or barren wasteland could also provide a great foundation for a horror story. Recommendations for other novels from Darcy Coates certainly also wouldn't hurt!",horrorlit

1710088739.0,Damnation Game,"Ill preface this by admitting that Clive Barker has played a large influence on my life. He was my first horror author, first inklings of realizations of my sexuallity so please take this review with these in mind. Im a person and able to be bias.

I really enjoyed this book by the ending, throughout the pages the characters had depth and motivations. Their flaws and goals seemed to class and build off on another in interesting dynamics. Specific characters came off chilling or grotesque as the scene needed it. Powerful and pitiful. There were though two characters who showed up near the end who I felt didnt add much to the plot besides their exploitation. 

There were scenes that linger on the edge of my thoughts at certain sights, like when i see my dog bite her leg I get flashes of grotesque imagery. There were scenes that managed to give a lingering sence of dread where I didnt want to see what I thought would happen next but I kept reading.

The start is slow, there is no denying this as it seems to be to common issue described by other readers. However, I enjoyed the slow burn of the candle. I also felt that it didnt fall into the trap of explaining too much letting the fear of the unknow linger and the readers imagination attempt to fill in the gaps.

While Sacrament still remains my faviorte of his work and Mister B Gone the most nestalgic for me I would still reccomend this book if youre willing to enjoy a slow start ",horrorlit

1710044495.0,Finished Episode Thirteen,"I just finished the audiobook for Episode Thirteen by Craig DiLouie. I thought it was fantastic overall, with a really strong middle and a satisfactory ending (that didn’t grip me quite as much as some of the earlier scenes). I had to turn off the audiobook several times because I am a wuss and the song that would play when things acted up freaked me out so badly. I was at my desk in the middle of the day having to take deep breaths to get through one scene (without spoiling anything for people who haven’t read it, the scene where they capture it on camera for the first time). 

I thought the characters were well written, although I did have trouble distinguishing a couple of the male characters. Jessica was my favorite, I felt really connected to her and why she was working with the group. Claire also felt fleshed-out, especially when she was making decisions I disagreed with as a reader who wanted everyone to run to safety. 

About the audiobook production: I listen to a lot of audiobooks at work, and this might be my top listening experience so far. Most of the books I listen to don’t have a full cast, so that was already exciting. The sound effects were so well done, it was kind of terrifying. 

I’m re-reading what I wrote next and it might be veering into spoiler territory by comparing it to a different book, so warning if you are planning to read and want the surprise. 

I found the ending to be pretty solid, but I saw some reviewers who felt it wasn’t quite as fresh for those who’ve read House of Leaves. I haven’t read House of Leaves but kind of know some general elements. Based on the little I know, I could see how the setting near the end might be similar. For me, the ending segment felt like a fitting and very scary ending for the characters, but I could see how it might have been underwhelming for others. The middle portions were just outstanding once the action picked up, so it was tough to top that. 

I’ll definitely look into Craig DiLouie’s other books to see if there’s anything else that might be a good fit for me. 

As a side note, my other favorite horror book is A Head Full of Ghosts. I think I really loved the reality show element of both books. If anyone has any recommendations for more horror with a reality show element, I’d love to hear them! I watched Ghost Adventures religiously as a kid, so I think on some level stories with the reality show component feel more “real” to me, and make me more terrified from the jump. 

Super glad I found a great audiobook experience/story combo. If I ever hear the song from the book in real life, I’m going to run first and ask questions later. ",horrorlit

1710037526.0,unknown horror movie,"im looking for a horror movie i watched around 2015-2018 but idk when it came out. it was on netfix in 2015 and it was a asian, chinese, japanese, malaysian, mandarin or somewhere in that league. the movie it had a antagonist (girl) with black long hair rlly white pale skin and her mouth was closed in the middle. there was a little girl protagonist and at one point in the movie her mouth was sealed and she clawed it to get her mouth back. the antagonist would hide under the bed and hurt ppl im not sure but i think she would suck the souls out of ppl like a [dementor.](https://dementor.im/) idk if there was.. but i think there was a point that there was almost like.. a seance. i think there was a point where they had a certain amount of time to get rid of the antagonist before they die and the movie had something to do with the number 7. (no it was not the ring or the grudge) and the antagonist wore black clothes. her mouth was closed in the middle but it wasn't sewn shut it was just like that naturally. i think it was made 2009-2018. does anyone know any horror movies like this?",horrorlit
1710030772.0,Between Two Fires by Chris Buehlman was incredible,"I made a post about this book a few days ago through the first 12ish chapters and it gained decent traction, so I figured I'd give my thoughts now that I'm totally finished. I feel like I can give a different perspective because I would never consider myself a fan of horror in any medium, and this book would be great for someone trying to get into horror literature. 

Buehlman's writing is slightly advanced. Keeping up with 14th century vernacular can be difficult, but he made it as easy as possible to navigate. He spent the perfect amount of time detailing a characters image and the setting. I can't stand when someone goes on and on with every minute detail, and Buehlman gave to exactly what you needed without rambling. 

The characters aren't the most unique in terms of archetypes, but they're executed so well. Thomas is your typical anti-hero who ends up on this journey begrudgingly after saving Delphine from his own crew. He's honestly the only character from the main trio with any major progression in my opinion, and he is my favorite from the book. His humor and the playful, yet brutal, back and forths he has with others (Delphine in particular) are hilarious. He is a shining example of what makes this book so great - the perfectly timed humor throughout this horrific tale. Delphine can be annoying at times, but I feel like this was intentional. I'm a grown man, so I'm looking at the events through a grown man's eyes, and it would be extremely frustrating to deal with a young girl crying over a flute when literal Hell has been brought to Earth. However, her ability to remain a child throughout the story kept everything pleasantly grounded. I also love how she was more so a vessel rather than a ""chosen one"" character type. The Priest, Matthieu, was the glue to the group. The one who kept Thomas from offing Delphine when he was being headstrong, but also making sure Delphine understood the gravity of the situation when she was being emotional. He's the most stereotypical character to me, the heavily flawed priest, but I didn't mind it. The way this group came together, and the way both Matthieu and Thomas protected Delphine, was so humbling. They made me laugh and cry numerous times throughout. This book is a decent length, not incredibly long, but I felt like I knew them throughout a 10 book series. The side characters were also great. Most of them are very short lived, but Buehlman maximized their ""screen time."" Jehan and Annette, and the big man on the raft leave a huge impact on the whole story despite lasting maybe 2 chapters each.

The horror in this was unsettling. Like I said in my first post, I didn't think a book could ever scare me, but this scared the shit out of me. What I loved was the mental horror was just as bad as the physical horror. My only complaint about the entire book, which is very nitpicky, is the scariest part was fairly early with the Paris arc. Other parts were still great and also scary, but I lost sleep over Paris and it stuck with me for days (honestly still with me). 

I truly do give this a 10/10 and wish I had someone to lend the book to just so we could talk about it

1710027303.0,Love finding books I almost bought at Barnes and Noble at hole in the wall bookstores for $2-$7,"I found a few horror books, Adam Neville books  and a few other books that caught my eye, but thought better of it. And just bought an expensive ass bookmark 🙄 

Walked into a small ass bookstore and found 3 out of 4 books i almost bought 

Would’ve spent $60-$70 but ended up spending $26 (bought 7 extra books lol) 

I’m am 

Content 😂 


But also 

What are some of your recommendations?? 

I love horror that has a twist, that makes me say out loud “ok…what the HELL???” And makes me feel queezy but excited to stay up until 3 am. 

But I don’t enjoy shock horror just to shock you, like child SA, incest, body horror for the reason of “just cuz”. 

Books that kind of are like Hereditary. Give me PASSION make me FEEL lol",horrorlit
1710026784.0,Thoughts on The Big Meat by Carlton Mellick III,"I was kind of disappointed. I think it's partly my fault as I had massively hyped myself up to the idea of it. I think it's main problem was that it could have used another 100 or 150 pages to really explore all the grimy facets of this world in which a gargantuan monster is rotting in the ruins of downtown Portland. I don't regret reading it for sure, but I just wanted more. ",horrorlit

Finding a comprehensive list of b to z grade horror movies is easy... Having less luck with novels! Thanks :)",horrorlit
1710021815.0,The House Across the Lake made me never want to read Riley Sager ever again,"“The House Across the Lake” by Riley Sager starts pretty interesting but as you keep reading, it starts to drag on. I felt several chapters going back and forth between “Before” and “Now” were repetitive. It took way too long for a real plot twist to happen as this was a slog to get through between the 20% - 70% mark of this novel.  
  
I felt that many situations involving the main protagonist’s drinking adventures, Casey, could have been truncated to make this novel tighter and a better read. A lot of these situations kept repeating themselves and honestly felt like fluff to me. This novel could have easily been about 100 pages shorter and it would have been a better reading experience. It starts creepy, fizzles out tremendously for a huge chunk of the novel, and by the time things get creepy again, it happens a lot later than it should have.  
  
When it comes to the dialogue and conversations between characters, I also noticed that a lot of things continued to be repeated to the point where I started to get frustrated because it’s a recurring theme. I’m all about a great story and the development of characters, but why explain a situation and then have that same situation repeated all over again in dialogue? I kept saying to just get to the point already and again, stop dragging things on.  
  
Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but towards the end when things finally get interesting, it does get boring because again, Sager keeps fleshing the obvious out to the point of no control. I wish things were edited down a bit and made sure that every word counted, not elaborate on every little thing three or four times over just to add more pages for the sake of adding more pages.  
  
When it came to the ending, I also felt it was unrealistic considering what went down with the lake and what eventually gets revealed. It’s like reading two different stories when it would have been better to simply stick to the creepiness of the lake and run with that, not trying to jam in something else that didn’t need to be added in. It just felt very unbelievable and took me out of the reading experience entirely, which I’ve dealt with in the past with Sager in “Survive the Night” with unrealistic situations and endings that would never, ever happen in the real world.  
  
Overall, I give “The House Across the Lake” by Riley Sager a 2/5 as I did enjoy the plot twists but they came way too late. I wish more was explained about Lake Greene to wrap things up and not have all this fluff that just made for a mostly boring reading experience. I should have learned from “Survive the Night” but make no mistake about it, I am done with reading anything Sager writes from here on out.",horrorlit

1710014912.0,Please help me find a book based off previous horrors I’ve liked and disliked. ,"The Only Good Indians - loved this book. The basketball scene was a bit much but emotionally by the end I was wrecked. 

Head Full of Ghosts - did not like at all. 

The Fisherman - I loved the atmosphere of this book but I don’t think I like science fiction horror at all. As soon as there was some monster fish or whatever I mentally checked out. 

House of Leaves - I haven’t technically finished this but I’m so far loving it. I lost the physical book and am still trying to find it. 


I love any horror movies that are set in a foggy outside atmosphere. I loved Haunting of Hill House (the tv show), I loved Midsommar and Hereditary. Despite never being able to watch it again (out of sheer horror lol), The Ring’s atmosphere is exactly what I am drawn to. 

I also LOVED the movie “I’m Thinking of Ending Things.” I love liminal space movies, or movies where something is off. I loved the Shining. If you watched season 1 of The Sinner, I would like to find something like that. It’s not technically a horror but there are a lot of unsettling bits. ",horrorlit

1710011058.0,"Well, I just finished reading American Psycho","I really enjoyed it. Several chapters are quite tedious, though, with all of Patrick's explicit details of what people are wearing, the things in every apartment or office and his music reviews, but I guess that's the point to emphasize Patrick's shallowness and materialism. Other than that, it's a pretty hilarious story with lots of absurd shit. As for the horror and violence scenes... Wow. That's all I can say. Wow. The murders are fucking brutal and unpleasant. I'm not someone who irks that much at ficitonal violece but the murders and tortures broke me.",horrorlit
1710011035.0,How many of Adam Nevill’s books are connected? ,"I’m currently reading No One Gets Out Alive and Kyle Freeman from Last Days is mentioned in this. For those that have read Last Days, you know that Kyle is a documentary filmmaker tasked with researching the Last Days cult.

“Kyle had accepted Amber’s story at face value, and so easily she had even questioned his readiness to believe her.” No One Gets Out Alive Page 523

It’s safe to assume after the events of Last Days, Kyle went back to his filmmaking and came across Amber’s story. I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts on this and to see if any more of Adam Nevill’s work connects like this. ",horrorlit
1710010455.0,My Stephen king rant. ,"Having a bit of trouble with my man SK lately. I’m new to reading and to SK I’ve heard from almost ever source available he’s the goat of the genre. Iv read now salems lot and the shining after which I really enjoyed. I gave salems lot a 3/5 stars on good reads and the shining a 4/5. I think I’m in the minority when i say his books are incredibly hard to pickup until the last 3rd of his books. I also read the exorcist and was blown away how good the pacing was comparatively. I’m a little disappointed I bought so much SK thinking salems lot was an outlier and more of his books would keep a better pace but they are just so slow. If you can get to the last 3rd they are very good. I tried pet semetary and decided to stop and take a massive break from the style. I’m now reading the girl next door and the pacing is so good. It’s such an easy read pacing wise.  The thought of giving SK the time to flesh out a book like the stand horrifies me how slow that book has the potential of being. And maybe no one else sees it as slow but just world building and character development which is true. But if we look at the shining I couldn’t stand reading about the history of the hotel. You could have quickly summed it up but instead we spent so much time following the entire history. I’m sure this rant is all over the place I’m at work and typing quickly. What’s your thoughts on this y’all? Am I crazy? 


EDIT: I’ve decided the books are  still worth consuming so when I workout/clean I’ll consume his stories via audio books as a compromise idk why I didn’t think about this before LOL",horrorlit

1710006590.0,A.M. Shine,"So I recently read both The Creeper and The Watchers back to back. And while I wasn't a big fan of the direction he took for The Creeper, I gotta say, I would read it again just for the style of his writing. The author is incredibly talented. Reminded me of listening to a hip-hop album of a great lyricist where I would here a great bar, have to rewind, and listen again. As for The Watchers, I genuinely loved it. It's not particularly scary. And maybe doesn't have the same flair as The Creeper. Although that's debatable. I loved the story and really cared for the characters. I'm calling it now, this guy is gonna deliver a commercial and critical classic one day. ",horrorlit
1710003411.0,How To Sell A Haunted House didn't hit for me...,"...and I don't really understand why. It's well-written enough, decent story, mostly developed characters (though throwing that one in toward the end was stupid, and there was another one again toward the end that I legitimately couldn't remember ever being introduced before but is casually mentioned like we know who it is), but something was missing. I guess I was never on the edge of my seat wondering what's going to happen next; everything felt largely predictable and I had the ""twist"" figured out way too early. I was just kinda waiting for it to end, yet it's on all of these best of lists. Anybody else? 


Also if you've got any recs for some sci-fi horror like *Recursion* or *Annihilation*, I think I'm leaning that way next. ",horrorlit

I’m not sure if “hands” is a typo. It appears in both Kindle and the Granta paperback edition. If the translation is correct, then the entire story has been altered. Can anyone compare with the Spanish original?

1709985694.0,The Troop,"Just finished The Troop (Nick Cutter) as it kept popping up on people’s lists of the most horrifying horror that they’ve read. I enjoyed the book a lot, I thought it was a classic monster horror story with a lot of body horror and gore thrown in. However, it didn’t really repulse or horrify me. Some scenes were definitely unsettling and gave me the creeps, like going into the dark cave with the monster, descriptions of the chimp who was experimented on, and the overall horror of human experimentation is always uncomfortable to say the least. Overall I thought it was an enjoyable horror story but not outstanding in any way. 

Cows, which also always pops up on such lists, I found disgusting in a put-me-off-my-food way and I had to put it down every now and then to take a deep breath. I was expecting more of these reactions from reading The Troop. 

I’m curious to hear others’ reactions to the book and if it did put you off your food or you had to put it down, which scenes or themes were the worst for you?",horrorlit
1709963565.0,Dean Koontz Explained,"If you are like me and have been to a used book store, you have likely seen Dean Koontz paperbacks scattered everywhere. They range in condition from band new to utterly destroyed. And often you see them on the clearance shelf. You have likely thought how can a guy have so many books published but so many of them rotting on a used book store clearance shelf. I don't claim to be an expert but here is my answer.

I have read 1 novel and 1 short story of Mr. Koontz because I was curious to uncover this mystery. Some may say this isn't enough to get a through perspective but I feel it is for this author in particular and to be honest I really did not want to read anymore of is writing.

The good:
- has great overall ideas for his stories
-his ideas for horror are excellent and I've seen great potential in the stories and a uniqueness that if done correctly can be truly horrifying
- some of the writing is excellent. I love the way he describes some things and has a unique way with great vocabulary to set a scene.

The bad:
- he is so heavy handed in everything he is trying to to say in the stories. It is almost as if he believes the readers will not be able to dicern an idea unless it is explicitly laid out for them
- the dialogue is brutal. Sometimes it's ok but sometimes you wonder if you could really picture someone saying those things. It doesn't sound like like how anyone I know would talk
-heavy handedness with Religious themes. Mr Koontz converted to Catholicism and it is very apparent in the short story I read. I am Catholic as well but he really really beats you over the head with the themes of Christianity to the point of nausication. I think stories can do great with Religious allegories but not written like this. It hurts.

Overall I would say if you like horror read one of his books (I'd probably want to research in advance like I did) to understand the author but I would not recommend reading more than that. Hopefully this explains a little more about the author. Like I said I claim to be no expert so if you have any input or think I missed the mark on anything please let me know. I'd love to hear other's thoughts!",horrorlit

1709933163.0,HELP NEEDED: Looking for the title of this horror book (collection of short stories)!,"Hi all!

When I was little (some 20 years ago) I had a book that absolutely terrified me (and probably would to this day). It was a small collection of short horror stories, of which I remember some. The book included some of the most horrifying illustrations I've ever seen. Sadly I no longer have the book, but I'm dying to find it again to read once more. The short stories felt old (like written around the era of Charles Dickens) and the settings were in old England if I recall correctly. 

The short stories I remember include:

\- A man entering a library to find an ancient old man sitting in a chair in the corner, which creeps him out. One day the man approaches the old man to find out that the wrinkled old man has no eyes. (included black and white drawing of wrinkled old man with huge empty eye sockets)

\- A man looking out of the window of the inn he's staying at to see that outside the window of a room in the floor below him, a strange skeletal thin man-like entity is beckoning to the occupants of the room inside. (accompanying illustration of a horrible demonic skeletal figure beckoning to someone inside a room from outside the window) Eventually the occupants are reported missing, and their corpse is found entertwined with a strange skeletal corpse in the bottom of a nearby well (or something like that)

\- A story of an evil stumpy tree that spews out demonic spiders

\- A short story of an uncle who welcomes his newly orphaned niece and nephew into his home, only for his niece and nephew to see horrible ghosts of children with their hearts cut out in various parts of the home. They eventually uncover the corpses of these heart-less children underneath the floorboards, and discover their uncle is going to ritually sacrifice them to the devil (or something) to obtain immortality by cutting out their hearts, and he has been collecting children's hearts for a while.

1709909689.0,Horror that actually makes you care about characters?,"After reading a good amount of horror, it seems that we tend to use characters as simply a device to advance the story. This is a lot worse in movies, but in general there is a trend of treating characters as disposable. This one will be torn apart by a zombie, that one  over there will have her head chopped off because why not, and that other one will just drown because I need to kill someone off this chapter.

Half Way Check In
I really really like the main character Colquitt Kennedy. She’s talkative and vivacious and I care about her. She makes good cocktails and she’s a great hostess. I told my s.o. I want to live in a neighborhood like Walter and Colquitt do. Full of life, friendship, comfortability and cocktails. It seems like a slower pace of life but I really would like to live that way. 
All the characters I didn’t care for too much have been killed off at a lovely pace, the story hasn’t been slow or boring at all even half way through. I’ve had to look up so many words that I didn’t know from this book. In a good way. I love novels like this.

End of Book Review

Wow. What a great book. I found this book through a tik tok recommendation, and randomly it didn’t disappoint. I found the main characters Walter and Colquitt Kennedy to be extremely relatable. This book being set in the 80’s didn’t affect its readability or relatability for me at all. Even though I am neither southern or rich, lol. This book makes me want to write a book. 

The ending was a little mysterious, with Kim Dougherty coming back to get married and purchase the haunted house. I don’t know why they had to kill him and the cats to burn the house down. Though I do think I would burn it down as well. I did love that the author described their slow descent into incredulity to their neighborhood friends. It was exactly how I would have gone about telling the world about a haunted house. I want to know more about Kim’s adoption and why he was made to build the house. I want to know what starts the fire that kills the house, colquitt, Walter and the rest. In retrospect? This book wasn’t blood and guts scary, but one that road the line between anxiety and societal fears. The ending made me think. It really did affect me. Could Colquitt and Walter be having a share delusion? But what about Kim pretty much being destined to build the home? Such a great read.

WHY COULDNT THEY JUST REHOME THE CATS MAN??

1709849317.0,Between Two Fires Question: Monkey Brains/Feast Scene,"Hi!

I am listening to Between Two Fires as an audiobook and I have hit a point in the book that has me in a psychic-stun lock, hoping someone can help me understand the passage with Father Matthieu speaking Latin at the feast.  During the strange feast with the Monkey Brains - the Count/Lord is antagonizing Father Mathieu about how to say ""These are my brains"" in Latin. 

&#x200B;

When Father Matthieu is translating the phrase to Latin he says, something about it ""sounding uncomfortably close to..."", since I don't have the text in front of me, I'm not quite sure what this could mean. Is it just that it sounds close to the phrases ""this is my body and blood"" during communion or is it specific to the Latin?

1709833270.0,I wish The Woman in Black had a different ending *spoilers*,"Sorry if you’re all tired of posts about The Woman in Black by now, but here goes…

I really enjoyed the book, it was a fun and creepy read, and though I wasn’t amazed by the way it was written I found the atmosphere it depicted to be incredible, haunting and somewhat unique. However, I would really wish a different ending for it.

It seems to break with the logic of the book that Arthur’s sightings of the Woman in Black the first time around doesn’t cause any child death, as the curse would normally go, but that the woman would rather show up AGAIN more than a year later, far away from Eel Marsh, to take away his son. This seems out of character from what we’ve learned previously, and also makes it seem that she has a specific vendetta for Arthur. I get that he was insistent and prying, but I get the sense from the things we learn in the book (from Jerome, for instance), that he is not the first to be too brave and curious for his own good. I think this takes away from some of the eeriness of the tale. Not to mention that this turn of events throws off the dates we’ve learned previously – in the first chapter of the book, we learn that Arthur was twelve years a widower by the age of 35. We also learn that he is 23 when he first travels to Eel Marsh (unless “barely 23 years old” can be taken to mean that he is 22? Sorry, English is not my first language). I loved the suspense of knowing by the very start of the story that Arthur’s wife would pass away within the year, and wondering how it would come about seeming as she was so far away from where the events take place. Having her finally show up in the village, only for them to leave, with nothing happening for more than a years time, made the story seem less tight-knit to me. The Woman in Black showing up in London then felt like a random insert.

I think it would have been cool if Stella showed up in the village to take Arthur home, and tell him she was pregnant. This could send Arthur into a disarray that would tarnish his last time spent with Stella, until she passed away in childbirth or similar within the year. It would feel more in keeping with what we had learned thus far, and give a sense that Stella’s coming to the village allowed the Woman in Black to grab on to her and mark her with the curse. 

I would also love to know if Arthur ever got that dog haha.",horrorlit
1709832540.0,A Few Under the Radar Recommendations,"I love getting book recommendations from this sub and seeing what other people are reading, so I thought I’d share a few things I read recently that I don’t see mentioned very often.  
***Knock Knock, Open Wide*** **by Neil Sharpson.** I loved this novel. It was funny, scary, and also romantic at times. KKOW follows a young queer couple, Betty and Ashling, as they meet in college and form a relationship. Ashling has a deeply troubled family history that is intertwined with a mysterious children’s TV show. The show features a puppet of a black goat that lives in a box and only comes out if children are naughty. Weirdly, Ash seems to be the only person who remembers the episode where the goat appears. Sharpson is Irish, and KKOW is deeply informed about Irish history and folklore. If you’re looking for a novel that delves into some slightly different scares and explores another culture’s myths, this is one to read.   
***The Militia House*** **by John Milas.** The novel follows a young marine deployed to Afghanistan around 2010. When you hear military horror, you might imagine a book about combat, but there’s no real battles in TMH. Instead, it is a book about the slow, grinding horror of the narrator’s experience. Things start to go awry for him when he and few others sneak out of the safe zone to enter an abandoned building (the titular militia house) where Soviet-era soldiers were supposedly skinned alive. A few reviews have compared it to *House of Leaves* and I can see that thematically, if not in narrative style. I really enjoyed it because I love a good unsettling slow burn and I am always on the hunt for horror in interesting locales.   
***An Ordinary Violence*** **by Adriana Chartrand.** I keep waiting to see this book on lists of Indigenous horror and it never comes up! A rec for anyone else who loves that genre—read this book. It’s an unsettling and unrelentingly bleak story that follows Dawn, a young Canadian woman who returns to her hometown when her troubled brother is released from prison. It’s cosmic horror but intensely focused on the familial relationships. The vibes are immaculate— the closest thing to it that I’ve read is Gus Moreno’s *This Thing Between Us.*   
Would love to know if anyone has read these and what you thought! If you have recs for similar stuff that isn’t mentioned as often on here, I am all ears. Happy reading!",horrorlit

1709819583.0,"I've been translating the 800s AD Chinese story that Lafcadio Hearn's ""Akinosuke's Dream"" was based on","I'm a big fan of Kwaidan, and as a professional translator, Hearn's work has really inspired me to dig into the treasure trove of old / ancient Chinese ghost stories that appear in the record from around 500 BC to 1600 AD.

In Kwaidan, Hearn says that ""Akinosuke's Dream"" was based on an old Chinese story, and I'm happy to say I was able to find the original with little trouble.

The original Chinese version is actually quite long. It's a multi-chapter novella known as a Tang Legend, from the Tang era of Chinese history (roughly 600 - 800 AD). This is also around the time that Japan was going full Sinophile and importing everything from Chinese culture it could get its hands on.

**Here's a fraction of the translated text.** I'll add a link to the article version (my website / blog) for those who are interested in reading on (though I've only completed parts 1 and 2 out of what will probably be 6 or 7).

Would love to know what you folks think.

[Article Version Here](https://ericrstone.com/2022/02/24/akinosukes-dream-chinese/)

There once lived a man named Fen Chunyu from Dongping County — a character of chivalrous exploits of the Southeast lands of Wu-Chu. He was fond of liquor, ill-tempered, and unrestrained in manner, and his family had amassed a large fortune, with which they housed a number of bold retainers.  
東平淳于棼，吳楚遊俠之士，嗜酒使氣，不守細行，累巨產，養豪客。  
Due to his martial talents, Fen had previously served as a deputy general for the Huainan military. However, after defying his general in a drunken outburst, Fen was stripped of his rank and left with nothing, and from then on wasted his days away drinking.  
曾以武藝補淮南軍裨將，因使酒忤帥，斥逐落魄，縱誕飲酒為事。  
Fen lived about 4 – 5 kilometers east of Guangling Commandery. At the southern end of his residence, there was a large pagoda tree with a dense canopy of long branches, the shade of which extended several meters. And it was under this shade that Mr. Chunyu spent his days drinking with his bold companions.  
家住廣陵郡東十里，所居宅南有大古槐一株，枝幹修密，清陰數畝，淳於生日與群豪大飲其下。  
One day, in the Ninth Month of the 7th year of Tangzhen (791 AD), Fen fell ill from his drinking, and two of his friends propped him up from his seat and walked him back to the house, where they laid him down in the eastern wing of the main hall.  
唐貞元七年九月，因沈醉致疾，時二友人於坐，扶生歸家，臥於堂東廡之下。  
They said to him: “You should rest. We’ll feed the horses and wash our feet, and leave later once you’re feeling better.”  
二友謂生曰：「子其寢矣，余將秣馬濯足，俟子小愈而去。」  
Fen unraveled his head wrappings and lay down to sleep in a daze, as if dreaming.  
生解巾就枕，昏然忽忽，彷彿若夢。  
Suddenly, he saw two emissaries in purple, and they prostrated themselves before him and said: “The Emperor of Huai’an has sent us humble servants to deliver an invitation.”  
見二紫衣使者，跪拜生曰：「槐安國王遣小臣致命奉邀。」  
Without knowing what he was doing, Fen got out of bed, tidied his clothes, and followed the emissaries to the door. There, he saw a small catalpa-wood carriage pulled by four livestock, with 7 – 8 attendants on either side. They helped Fen onto the carriage, and it exited through the gate, toward a cavern under the pagoda tree, into which the emissaries promptly drove them. And though Fen thought this peculiar, he didn’t dare ask questions.  
生不覺下榻整衣，隨二使至門。見青油小車，駕以四牡，左右從者七八，扶生上車，出大戶，指古槐穴而去，使者即驅入穴中。生意頗甚異之，不敢致問。  
In a flash, Fen saw mountains, streams, roads, and greenery, in a landscape most unlike that of the world of men. And after traveling several kilometers, they came to a city wall with parapets, where the road was an endless sea of people and carriages.   
忽見山川風候，草木道路，與人世甚殊。前行數十里，有郛郭城堞，車輿人物，不絕於路。  
Attendants barked orders sternly from Fen’s left and right, and the pedestrians raced to part to the roadside. And as they entered the city’s walls, there stood a crimson door and a storied tower with the words “The Great Nation of Huai’an” written in gold upon it.  
生左右傳車者傳呼甚嚴，行者亦爭辟於左右。又入大城，朱門重樓，樓上有金書，題曰「大槐安國」。  
The door guards rushed forward to prostrate themselves before immediately withdrawing, and a rider on horseback announced: “As his royal son-in-law has traveled far, the Emperor has arranged for you to take lodging in the Donghua Building.”  
執門者趨拜奔走，旋有一騎傳呼曰：「王以駙馬遠降，令且息東華館。」  
The rider turned to lead the way; and, in the next moment, a door opened, and Fen descended the carriage to enter.  
因前導而去。俄見一門洞開，生降車而入。  
The Donghua Building was a spectacle of intricately carved and colorfully painted columns and banisters. Gorgeous trees bearing rare and precious fruits were planted in rows outside of the main hall, while cushions, tables, refreshments, and drapery were arranged within. And Fen was inwardly most pleased!  
彩檻雕楹，華木珍果，列植於庭下；几案茵褥，簾幃餚膳，陳設於庭上。生心甚自悅。  
A voice announced: “The west-minister has arrived.”   
復有呼曰：「右相且至。」  
And Fen descended the steps to pay courtesy, as a man in purple with an ivory flat-scepter rushed forward. Host and guest exchanged formalities, and the west-minister said: “My emperor has invited Sir here — not on the premise that my humble nation is distant and secluded — to make ties to you through marriage.”  
生降階祗奉。有一人紫衣象簡前趨，賓主之儀敬盡焉。右相曰：「寡君不以弊國遠僻，奉迎君子，托以姻親。」  
Fen replied: “I am but a wretched body; I dare not hope for such.”  
生曰：「某以賤劣之軀，豈敢是望。」  
And thus, the west-minister led Fen away.  
右相因請生同詣其所。  
After about 100 paces, they entered a crimson door, on the other side of which spears, halberds, hatchets, and battle-axes were on display to the left and right, and hundreds of imperial military officials parted to make way. Among them, Fen saw his life-long drinking buddy Bian Zhou, and he felt joy in his heart, though he didn’t dare to approach him for inquiry.  
行可百步，入朱門，矛戟斧鉞，布列左右，軍吏數百，辟易道側。生有平生酒徒周弁者，亦趨其中，生私心悅之，不敢前問。  
The west-minister led Fen up to a spacious palace, and there the guards were especially grim — this apparently His most reverent abode. Fen saw a magnificent figure in the room’s center, wearing pure-white silk robes and a crimson decorated crown, and he began to tremble, not daring to look up, as attendants on either side of him made him prostrate...

This might be a hot take, but i found the first half (and i mean that so literally, like split HOTTT down the middle) was donkey cheeks. Honestly it was so mind-numbingly slow that it took me an entire month to get to the halfway point, and this is a very short read. BUT i kept hearing great things about it, so i powered through, and my god was it worth it. Sure, the first half had its ominous moments of a potentially haunted Alexa-equivalent smart speaker, and the exploration of Thiago’s grief felt quite real, like the loneliness and regret creeped up on him slowly, but rarely did it keep me flipping the pages. The second half started picking up and i found myself picking it up and flipping pages more and more often. The whole plot line of Thiago and Brimley was a nice positive addition to an otherwise depressing story until *that part* happened. From then on, i was hooked. Everything got so incredibly creepy and sinister, sometimes even humorously ironic like in the part where the vet swiped the salt from the doorway. I loved how much of a lurking threat the wall felt like and how uneasy the beach and cook seemed during that dream-like sequence. Let’s see if the end holds up. I’m about 40 pages from finishing, but i couldn’t wait to post this. I’ll see if i put an update in here after i’m all done, but wow, i’m loving it after the first half. ",horrorlit
1709772469.0,Dead Inside by Chandler Morrison,"I got this book because I have been on a cannibal theme lately, and wasn’t quite prepared. I went in not knowing anything but that it features cannibalism, but what the actual fuck?? I read it all and quickly, it was like the most horrific train wreck ever that I couldn’t peel my eyes away from. Every time I finished reading a part that was more extreme than the last, and it just kept going. The writing was good, but the subject matter just felt like it was going for more and more shock appeal. I mean there is corpse-fucking within the first 16 pages smh. I don’t think I need to read anything else like it, Woom was probably even a bit much for me. What are some other cannibal themed books that you guys have enjoyed?

My Nope List - Books I’ve read but can’t recommend, but others might like since they cosmic horror:

•Nightside Series  by Simon Green - ‘ and it was the easiest thing in the world ‘ to put this series down - repetitive writing, lame troupes, the ‘damage girl’ sub plot.   

•The Man with the Golden Torc - I think I’m just not a Simon Green fan, good world build but dull characters.

•The Abyss above us ( just a sloppy story).   

•Beneath the Ring by Premee Mohamed  books - Characterization/romance kills the story for me, comes of as YA. Good world building, though.

•Anomaly Flats ( Weird town troupe but not well done, the main character sucks as a human being).  

•The Others Series - I just couldn’t get into it. 

•Boom (Harry Potter meets George Washington/period fanfic but ridiculous with huge plot hole - at one point the MC fight evil suits, like the literal clothing item)

•The Gone World - Good core concept, badly executed. A classic example of men writing women poorly).   

But hey, that’s just like my opinion, so if you like any of the above more power too ya!!

Ok, so now add your favorites and suggestions please!!!

❤️ Lists are great!
👍 single title recommendations also great!

1709735024.0,Looking for dead space/ diseased horror,"Hey everyone, I was playing the dead space remake and kinda wanted to listen to some books with similar vibes. Particularly the enclosed environment, and the characters getting chased and picked off. Doesn't have to be in space or the future, the only monster or whatever I don't care for is ghosts/spirits. Just never liked or cared for them. Was also interested in something more diseased based. The only requirement is being on audible. I listen to audiobooks during my shift and don't have the time to sit down and read during my freetime. I've listen to the troop, the last plague and from below. The only one I didn't like was from below. The last plague was good but I didn't care for the narrator at all. Thank you in advance",horrorlit
1709733361.0,"Just finished the Final Destination Books...looking for more like that! (Gamified death - ""We must figure out what's killing us before it picks us off one by one!"")","Looking for adventuresome books where the characters are trying to deal with something that's picking them off in a manner that they need to figure out/fight to win against. 

Doesn't matter too much what it is! Cursed object, monster, shadowy demon. Whatever! Bonus points if it's something that I get to learn about as the book progresses.

I'd prefer if it's not just a standard serial killer. In fact, the more ""human"" the killer is, the less interested I am. Something along the lines of Battle Royale or the Escape Room movies, is fine, since an entity making people play death games is right up my alley, but a dude in a mask just isn't for me. 

Interesting/weird deaths are also a major plus. 

Books kind of in the same vein that I've read and liked - **The Ruins, The Troop, Dead Silence, Amulet, Rolling in the Deep/Into the Drowning Deep.** 

The writing should at least aspire to good...I'm unfortunately a bit of a snob and can't really sacrifice writing for story. 

Thanks in advance, and I promise to one day recommend the perfect book to one of you. 😊",horrorlit
1709727849.0,The Lovely Bones,"This book was not really what I had anticipated. Given that I could watch the film, I was expecting some sort of thriller or mystery-solving novel involving a dead girl, driven by revenge to help people solve a murder.

This is not what I got at all. The Lovely Bones was more about grieving families, if anything else, and watching as a fly on the wall. There were some thriller elements but far and few between.

With The Lovely Bones, I felt like you had to be in a specific mood to finish it. I did find it quite difficult to read, as I dragged my heels throughout the entire book, realising it was not going to be the thriller I expected.

The more I think back to the story, the more I note that it is a well-written book but just not to be fooled by the film feature. The book is nowhere near as exciting as the movie, and can definitely drag. 

Abigail, Susie's mother, was literally the worst. I absolutely loathed her as a character—an utterly disgusting, cowardly woman who literally ditched her only other child and husband to go ""soul-searching."" I wanted to push her and her ocean eyes into the sinkhole. We don't need any more deadbeat parents in this world!

If you're a horror lover, I wouldn't recommend this book to you. It's more a book giving you a different perspective on life, maybe helping you appreciate what you have. It makes you realise and remember that everybody is disposable at any point; you could lose someone you love in a horrible accident in a matter of days.

I liked aspects of the book, but it definitely wasn't my favorite.",horrorlit
1709722722.0,The Watchers,"This was a very satisfying read, considering I had just wandered into Waterstones and looked at a few books that caught my fancy. Thanks to all you guys who recommended this book; it was a delight.

The overall atmosphere in this book was described beautifully and left me with a chill down to my core. I really felt emerged in the world, especially the intertwined forest!

Mina was a safe protagonist to follow. I loved that she brought a Golden Conya named ""The Yellow One"" with her literally everywhere. I knew that was symbolic of hope, considering she was trapped in a literal nightmare!

I'll be honest; I felt like this book was missing one tiny detail, and that's a bit of intimacy. In this cruel world, if there’s a few people trapped in a forest surrounded by monsters and there is an attractive young lad named Daniel, obviously interested in a girl like Mina, there would normally be a little action. It brings the whole realism factor into play, and adds more layers to their relationship.

I saw the twist coming halfway through the book, so I wasn't surprised when I was right. I felt like the author mentioned too many specific things that would be hard to miss. Despite that, I still very much enjoyed the story! The scene with Keira’s house was honestly terrifying, and I was on the edge of my seat.

A very good book; I would thoroughly recommend it if you enjoy creepy creatures in the woods!",horrorlit
1709716065.0,Horror recommendations: not supernatural/paranormal ,"I'm after some horror book recommendations. I love horror but nothing seems to scare me. 

As with films, I prefer human horror to monsters/supernatural/paranormal etc. I'm not into fantasy or sci-fi either. If it can happen in real life, that's what gets me. I'm ok with gore but not if it overtakes the plot.

Gone To See The River Man - Kristopher Triana (didn't like the folklore parts)

The Venue - T.J Payne (fun but nothing original)

1709699471.0,The Ruins,"I’m reeling. So much about this book has filled me with dread and horror and sadness. Some thoughts:
- The description of Eric’s final moments in which he flays himself is among the most brutal I’ve ever read. I was squirming under my covers the entire time. 
- Stacy’s suicide is so profoundly sad. The terror of being alone there makes me feel like there’s an anvil on my chest.
- The novel feels so incredibly hopeless, yet I was constantly thinking of a way for even one character to survive. That being said, I like how Smith subverted the expectations of Amy being a “final girl” type.
- I can’t decide how I feel about Jeff. I’m a fan of characters that cause internal conflict. 
- The dread I felt at the end when the Greeks showed up…
- At times I felt that Mathias had intentionally led them to the ruins, which I definitely think was purposeful on Smith’s part. He’s an interesting character.
- I’ve realized that some of my favorite horror has concerned parasitic creatures (The Troop, a particular scene from My Best Friend’s Exorcism). Something about playing host fills me with terror.

For my New Year’s resolution I set to read everyday, as I did not grown up reading and maybe read 5 books in my whole life. I just finished my 5th book of the year! All horror!

I’m looking to get into a short story collection next. I think I will get through all of these at some point this year but wondering if you all could suggest what would be a good next step for me?

Books of Blood Clive Barker 
Teatro Grottesco Thomas Ligotti
Behold the Void (or Beneath A Pale Sky) Philip Fracassi

1709650107.0,Never thought horror writing could scare me until Christopher Buehlman's Between Two Fires,"Disclaimer: I have only recently started reading novels again. I've always loved comics and that's where I've stayed since I graduated HS (I'm 29 now) because back then reading novels was a chore. I'm not the biggest horror fan in general, but the synopsis of Between Two Fires intrigued me. People said it was horrifying, but I didn't believe an author could truly scare me with merely words. For those that have read this book - I just finished chapter 11 or 12, the part where Delphine, Thomas, and the priest stay with the Woodcarver and his wife in Paris. As the statues knock from door to door getting closer and Mary eventually gets into their house I bet I had a BPM of 120. The description of Annette and Jehan's death was brutal, the visual of the dead baby being thrown around swarmed by flies was unsettling, and Thomas' initial failed attempts at taking the statue down gave me a sinking feeling. Just when you think it's over, as the trio pass the church from which the statues came and are mentally attacked by the statues... it took me a bit to fall asleep last night. I can definitely say I'm a fan of what a good horror novel can do.",horrorlit
1709638077.0,In the Suicide Motor Club is Judith... *MASSIVE SPOILER WARNING*,"Recently finished the above and enjoyed it like a lot of Buhleman's books I hate the ending initially then love it later.

Anyways, at the end of the book I felt quite a few hints were dropped that Judith had become a vampire in the final pages. During the big climatic battle she gets bit a couple of times and though it never says anything along the lines of her blood being drank and then spat back in (the way vampires are made in this universe) it seems fairly plausible with all the throwing around in the car and the fight this could easily happen accidentally.

Shortly after this when Judith is walking towards Luther with the big cross she gets shot in the stomach, but as she marches towards him the bullet comes out and the wound heals just like for the vampires. It is still vague though as the cross does have supernatural powers ie heals itself, creates a huge explosion which wipes out Luther and Neck Brace.

Later on it seems less likely because Judith does go into the sun to kill Robert so it would appear she's not a vampire except for two things:

a) despite there only being a relatively short time since the sun rose and Judith getting back to Clayton's hiding spot she has 'severe sunburn'.

and

b) a passing comment is made to how 'older vampires burn quicker.'

At the very least I think Buhleman is being ambiguous and suggesting that due to her only being turned minutes earlier the sun would weaken her/burn her, but not to the level we've seen on the older vampires. 

Personally, I believe she was turned. What do you guys think? I've tried searching for this topic but to my surprise none seems to have written about this theory so am curious about what others think? ",horrorlit

In the past year or so I’ve become a big fan of classic gothic/victorian horror, and I’m wondering if anyone had any good recommendations for novels or short stories with a specific gothic amosphere to them. Dracula and Dorian Gray most capture the vibe that I love, with a very gloomy and atmospheric London setting and slow, methodical pacing. I’ve recently been reading more short horror stories of the period (Poe, Henry James, Etc.) and while I do love them I’m having trouble finding something that really encapsulates the very dark gothic vibes of Dorian Gray & Dracula- any recommendations? I typically only like older literature like that but I’d be open to newer stuff too.
Thanks!

UPDATE: At some of you guys’ recommendation, I have finally read all of Frankenstein and am now about halfway through Wuthering Heights (I know, I read fast) and while I enjoyed Frankenstein a lot, it felt more like proto sci-fi than the bleak atmospheric horror or drama I like- but I am LOVING Wuthering Heights, definitely similar vibes to Dorian Gray as a few of you have said.

Here I am again. 
Last time I covered my distaste for endings in the Invited, Children on the Hill, and the Winter People. Now I give you the drowning kind, and the night sisters.
Drowning kind? I applaud it. The mystery of the water kept me reeling and hooked me in. Layered characters and everything- however I am a sucker for explanations, I just so badly wanted to know what, when, why the pool is the way it is. The ending however? I think it was perfect. Kind of she finally chose a good stopping point and didn’t over complicate it. 
Night Sisters? I loved the base. A firm base, with eerie elements all over. But, this one did leave me disappointed by the last half. With this one, I felt she revealed her secret surprise twist too ample too early, cause I had it figured out. But also it just didn’t creep me out enough, I also wanted a back story on why their family was cursed to be the way they were? Also they treated Rose so horribly, and I felt like the whole uncle Fenton-sylvie affair needed to be a bigger deal. 
I did like the base better than the drowning kind, but drowning kind won with ending it right. The family inheriting the Marr thing, I just think it was a last minute rash decision.

1709578995.0,My Darling Girl: I have some THOUGHTS on Alison’s husband,"I read My Darling Girl by Jennifer McMahon in January, and I’m still mad about the way Alison’s husband acts throughout that book. I hated him so much I wished they’d kill him off, honestly. Like, your mother-in-law, who has a record of abuse and mistreatment of your wife, moves in to die in your house. Your wife’s mental state begins to decline as she claims her mother is treating her differently behind closed doors than she is in front of the rest of the family. Do you believe your wife that MIL is back to her old tricks and tell her mother to GTFO and die on the street like the abusive PoS she is know to be? No, how about instead you let the known abuser continue to live in your house and torment your wife. When your wife complains, convince her that SHE’S the one who’s losing it and that she’s cruel for wanting her out of the house.

Like, come ON. I think this book hit close to home because I have major mommy issues, but it makes me go a little insane when people won’t believe victims of abuse even when it’s right in front of them. “You need to be nicer to your mom” was a refrain I heard all the time growing up, because abusers are EXTREMELY capable of pretending to be another person in front of others. Sure, she’s nice to you, but she ISN’T nice to me, and her being occasionally nice doesn’t cancel out the bad shit she’s done. If my partner sided with my mother over me on something like this, I would never be able to move past it. Ever. It would be an instant relationship over. 

It’s so crazy how the entire plot of the book could be resolved by the husband saying “okay that’s enough of that, you need to leave” after the first couple incidents, and it’s even crazier to me that Alison can bear to look at him after all is said and done.

I did not take note of the author (how many books called Exquisite Corpse could there be??) And borrowed it from my library.

Turns out I had borrowed the Marija Pericic version rather than the Poppy Z Brite version mentioned in this sub.

This book is still a horror, but rather than a book about a serial killer, it is about the lengths a person will go to preserve the one they love.

The horror elements come in slowly but they are pretty much exactly what you would expect from a book with the title Exquisite Corpse and the tag line ""romance is dead"". 

I enjoyed this book because of the story, but also the fact that it was written as an actual exquisite corpse (a writing game where different people take up the thread of the story and continue it https://www.moma.org/collection/terms/exquisite-corpse).

I’m talking an intact conscience while actively being consumed by delusion and fear and outside forces, not exclusively internal forces like Jekyll and Hyde. My favorite realistic horror film is Climax, and the way it portrays so many horrifying situations is so eerie and consuming. I LOVE tropes like this especially when the whole “who dunnit” slowly loses priority to the horrors of the plot. It doesn’t have to play out like that movie or how I described it but I think it’s a good starting point for now ! ",horrorlit

1709496859.0,Consuming Horror Books,I’ve been struggling and just want some horror books to curl up with and be absolutely consumed by. That gobble you up and make you feel like you’re there (somewhere else). What do you recommend and why?? Thanks! ,horrorlit
1709496399.0,Which book should I pick next? ,"I listen to audio books on the way to work. So far I have listened to Ghost Radio, Devolution, and The Lost Village. I enjoyed devolution the most, which is surprising because the premise of the other two stories should be more up my alley. 

Could people suggest next audiobooks for me? Happy to answer any questions that may help us narrow down the selection. 

Thank you :) ",horrorlit
1709495113.0,Looking for a very specific kind of horror,"My favorite --absolute favorite -- stories involve people who, over the course of the story, become the monsters. I don't mean figuratively either, like literally turns into a monster, a la >!The Magnus Archives!< Or the movie >!The Cave!< Or >!that one movie about the soldier in the Mexican American war that accidentally becomes a windego!<

I know vampires or werewolfs fall under that category and I like them well enough but they don't tend to be .....slow burn? Enough for me? Or I have yet to come across any that hit that sweet spot I'm looking for. I don't know if I'm explaining this in a very well, but I'm kind of jonesing for something like this after finishing >!The Magnus Archives!< and so far haven't been able to find anything to scratch that itch. Hopeing this sub can help.",horrorlit

1709493469.0,I just finished The Doll Master by Joyce Carol Oates. Loved the stories.,"Hello, I enjoy Oates’ horror short stories and how they are open ended or left up to the reader to assume what’s happened. Usually, there’s something supernatural or a hinted delusion of the characters involved. The Doll Master stories are horror but the reader knows what the main character refuses to see or is naive. It’s great because of how each story unfolds and Oates’ storytelling from the perspective of the main character. Infuriating for the reader but absolutely engaging! Recommend it to horror fans! Anyone else have thoughts about the stories?",horrorlit
