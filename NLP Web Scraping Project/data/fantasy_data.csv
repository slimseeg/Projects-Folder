1595798574.0,"Patrick Rothfuss's editor confirms that, after nine years, she is yet to read a single word of THE DOORS OF STONE","In somewhat surprising news, Patrick Rothfuss's editor Betsy Wollheim [has reported](https://www.facebook.com/betsy.wollheim/posts/3449737608372826) that she is yet to read any material from his next novel, *The Doors of Stone*, the third and concluding volume in **The Kingkiller Chronicle**, and notes a lack of communication on the book's progress.

Rothfuss shot to fame with the first book in the trilogy, *The Name of the Wind*, in 2007. With over 10 million sales, *The Name of the Wind* became one of the biggest-selling debut fantasy novels of the century. The second book, *The Wise Man's Fear*, did as well on release in 2011. Nine years later, the third book remains unpublished.

*The Doors of Stone* is probably the second-most-eagerly-awaited fantasy novel of the moment, behind only George R.R. Martin's *The Winds of Winter*, which it actually exceeds in waiting time (though only by five months). Martin has [provided](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/06/23/writing-reading-writing/) [updates](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/07/19/writing-2/) on *The Winds of Winter*, albeit extremely infrequent ones, but has recently reported much more significant progress being made. Rothfuss, on the other hand, has maintained near constant zero radio silence on the status of book in recent years, despite posting a picture of an apparently semi-complete draft in 2013 that was circulating among his beta readers.

Reasons for the delay, as with Martin, have been speculated. Rothfuss has reported bouts of ill health, as well as trauma related to family bereavements. Rothfuss was also closely involved in an attempt to launch a multimedia adaptation of his books, which would have involved both a trilogy of films based directly on the novels and a prequel TV series revolving around the parents of his protagonist, Kvothe. However, the TV show was cancelled mid-development at Showtime, apparently due to massive cost overruns on their **Halo** television series, and a new network has not yet picked up the series. The movies also fell out of active development when director Sam Raimi, who had expressed interest, decided to move forward with a different project. Both projects now appear to be on the backburner at Lionsgate (unsurprisingly, the pandemic has not helped this situation).

Rothfuss has also been involved in charity work, blogging, video game commentary, spin-off material and contributing writing to other projects, causing comparisons to be drawn with Martin's similar engagement in secondary projects, which some commentators have speculated is the main cause of delays on the books. Without having access to an author's schedule, it is of course impossible to say if this is really the case, only that the *perception* of it being the case becomes unavoidable if the author in question is refusing to provide concrete updates on their book progress whilst discussing other, unrelated work in multiple public communications. Questions of ethics and obligations on the part of authors to their readers have circulated on this subject for decades, ever since the delays to Harlan Ellison's *The Last Dangerous Visions* (originally due to be published in 1974, Ellison was allegedly still occasionally promising to publish it at the time of his death in 2018) stretched into the decades, and have been debated ad nauseam online enough to avoid going over them again here, suffice to say that the tolerance for such activities will vary dramatically by reader.

>""[This article](https://bookriot.com/authors-dont-owe-you-books/amp/?fbclid=IwAR3EjfvLBvDLzzbOe9qdARUQISwCx0uD6Rz9txcT3QbDea3IVg01Y9_tAk8) is right: authors don't owe their readership books, but what about the publishers who paid them? Book publishing is not as lucrative as many other professions, and publishers rely on their strongest sellers to keep their companies (especially small companies like DAW) afloat. When authors don't produce, it basically f\*\*\*s their publishers...When I delayed the publication of book two, Pat was very open with his fans--they knew what was happening. I've never seen a word of book three.""

Wollheim's statement is surprising, however. Martin has noted being in communication with his editors on numerous occasions, flying to New York to provide in-person updates and apologise for the book's lateness, and periodically submitting completed batches of chapters for them to work on whilst he continues to write new material. In the case of **The Kingkiller Chronicle**, Wollheim reports not having read a single word of *The Doors of Stone* in the nine years since *The Wise Man's Fear* was published, which is mind-boggling. If Rothfuss had a semi-complete draft in 2013 that he was circulating to friends and early readers, the question arises why he didn't also share this draft with his publishers. Furthermore, if the book's non-appearance since 2013 indicates considerable problems with this draft (as would appear inevitable), it would also appear to be common sense to share that draft with his publishers to see if they agree. It's not uncommon for authors to believe their latest novel is poor and a disaster and threaten to delete it and having to be talked off the ledge by their editors, since they've been working so closely on the material that they've lost all objectivity.

Normally, of course, authors only share completed manuscripts (at least in first draft) with their editor, but when the author in question is a decade behind schedule and one of the biggest-selling authors in the publishers' stable, that normally changes to having much more regular feedback.

Although she notes the impact a long-missing manuscript can have on the margins of a small publisher like DAW, Wollheim notes no ill feeling towards Rothfuss and she continues to be proud of him and the work they've done in the first two volumes:

1655851518.0,11 questions I wish male fantasy authors would ask themselves before publishing.,"I’ve been a diehard fantasy fan all my life, but I am so constantly frustrated by series like WoT and Night Angel that simplify women or use them to make men look cooler. I wrote these a while ago and thought I’d share. Would love additions!

1. Do your female characters have inner struggles/ identity journeys or emotional developments that have nothing to do with motherhood or romantic love?
2. Are your female characters as complex as their male counterparts?
3. One in four women has been raped. The rape scene you’re thinking about including  could very well alienate, traumatize, or lose you the loyalty of a big chunk of your potential audience. Knowing this, do you still think it is essential to the plot? Are you using it to create a meaningful motivation and essential piece of the story, or are you just trying to create a general aura of evilness for this (rapist) character or this world? Could something else work instead?
4. Are your any female characters single dimensionally morally pure or single-dimensionally seductive sex pots? Do you have madonnas and whores? 
5. If we know your character’s breast size, do we also know what her face looks like and at least three facets of her personality? 
6. If your (male) hero has a love interest or, especially, TWO, have we as readers seen enough evidence to justify that love? Have we seen growing intellectual connection, mutual respect, etc . , or is this just adoration from afar? Are you using female characters as foils to make your male characters look cool?
7. Have you considered drawing from aspects of real women you know—like capturing your mom’s propensity for taking new neighbors under her wing or your friend’s struggles feeling comfortable working in a male-dominated field?
8. Do you have characters whose gender doesn’t matter? Could they be women?
9. Do you have opportunities to ground your female characters in ways that make them feel relatable rather than idealistic? (E.g. body hair/acne, coping with societal pressures, identity crises, family obligations warring with dreams, depression or other mental health issues etc.)
10. Are you sure your understanding of a an experience in the female body (like pregnancy or periods) is accurate? Have you asked at least one and ideally multiple women who have gone through that experience to read it and confirm that it is? 
11. If you have a hero that we’re supposed to like and be rooting for, how does he treat the women in his world?

Edit: shout out to my boy Brandon Sanderson, though, for doing female characters (imo) exceptionally well.

Edit 2: Wheel of Time might have been a bad example (there are lots of women characters, and many have depth). I didn’t mean to condemn either that series or Night Angel, both of which I enjoyed. 

And edit 3: To the people who are angry with this post, I never meant to antagonize male writers or suggest they’re all bad. I just wanted to express my personal sense of feeling misunderstood and possibly be helpful if new writers ARE looking for guidance. If you’re on the fence about whether to send an angry message, please don’t. I have immense love and respect for everyone in this community.

Also, I’d personally love a similar list for women authors to ask themselves about male characters! 

Another edit (I’m so sorry lol): the rape stat in question 3 varies by source ([here](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence) is one that says 1 in 6). My point is just that it’s common.",Fantasy

You’ve a gift for language, you’re a deft hand at plotting, and your books seem to have an enormous amount of attention to detail put into them. You’re so good you could write anything. Why write fantasy?**

Pratchett: I had a decent lunch, and I’m feeling quite amiable. That’s why you’re still alive. I think you’d have to explain to me why you’ve asked that question.

**O: It’s a rather ghettoized genre.**

P: This is true. I cannot speak for the US, where I merely sort of sell okay. But in the UK I think every book— I think I’ve done twenty in the series— since the fourth book, every one has been one the top ten national bestsellers, either as hardcover or paperback, and quite often as both. Twelve or thirteen have been number one. I’ve done six juveniles, all of those have nevertheless crossed over to the adult bestseller list. On one occasion I had the adult best seller, the paperback best-seller in a different title, and a third book on the juvenile bestseller list. Now tell me again that this is a ghettoized genre.

**O: It’s certainly regarded as less than serious fiction.**

P: (Sighs) Without a shadow of a doubt, the first fiction ever recounted was fantasy. Guys sitting around the campfire— Was it you who wrote the review? I thought I recognized it— Guys sitting around the campfire telling each other stories about the gods who made lightning, and stuff like that. They did not tell one another literary stories. They did not complain about difficulties of male menopause while being a junior lecturer on some midwestern college campus.

Fantasy is without a shadow of a doubt the ur-literature, the spring from which all other literature has flown. Up to a few hundred years ago no one would have disagreed with this, because most stories were, in some sense, fantasy. Back in the middle ages, people wouldn’t have thought twice about bringing in Death as a character who would have a role to play in the story. Echoes of this can be seen in Pilgrim’s Progress, for example, which hark back to a much earlier type of storytelling. The epic of Gilgamesh is one of the earliest works of literature, and by the standard we would apply now— a big muscular guys with swords and certain godlike connections— That’s fantasy. The national literature of Finland, the Kalevala. Beowulf in England. I cannot pronounce Bahaghvad-Gita but the Indian one, you know what I mean. The national literature, the one that underpins everything else, is by the standards that we apply now, a work of fantasy.

Now I don’t know what you’d consider the national literature of America, but if the words Moby Dick are inching their way towards this conversation, whatever else it was, it was also a work of fantasy. Fantasy is kind of a plasma in which other things can be carried. I don’t think this is a ghetto. This is, fantasy is, almost a sea in which other genres swim. Now it may be that there has developed in the last couple of hundred years a subset of fantasy which merely uses a different icongraphy, and that is, if you like, the serious literature, the Booker Prize contender. Fantasy can be serious literature. Fantasy has often been serious literature. You have to fairly dense to think that Gulliver’s Travels is only a story about a guy having a real fun time among big people and little people and horses and stuff like that. What the book was about was something else. Fantasy can carry quite a serious burden, and so can humor. So what you’re saying is, strip away the trolls and the dwarves and things and put everyone into modern dress, get them to agonize a bit, mention Virginia Woolf a few times, and there! Hey! I’ve got a serious novel. But you don’t actually have to do that.

(Pauses) That was a bloody good answer, though I say it myself.",Fantasy
1622429952.0,"If an author doesn't bother to write female characters well, then they don't write characters well. Period.","*EDIT: Please stop sending me antagonistic DMs. If you have something to say, you can say it here where everyone can see you. I've had to block several people already. Grow up.*

A female character is a character that is female. The ""character"" part should be more important than the ""female"" descriptor in regards to their place in the fictional story. If an author is consistently writing them with a sexist lens or a shallow manner, or not making the effort to create nuanced female characters on the same level of the males, then maybe we should stop saying ""they don't write female characters well"" as a minor criticism but rather ""this author doesn't write characters well"" as a major criticism, because after all, the female characters... are **characters**, just like the males. They are people the author created, people inhabiting the story. Females are 50% of the human race and if an author is consistently *choosing* to write them in a lesser, demeaning, or shallow way, then that should be a major criticism of the way they write characters in general. 

I'm really aware of the way people talk about these things, the type of language they use to talk about characters, and I'm sick of women in fantasy books being referred to as almost an afterthought; for example, some version of this comment I've seen so many times for various series: ""I love this authors's work, but I definitely think they have a problem writing women,"" or ""I adore this series and I think the author is really talented, if you can just look past how they write women."" Like sorry, but no, I don't want to ""look past"" this. That's a quick way to make me never want to pick up that author's work. Life is way too short to spend time reading shitty ~~female~~ characters. 

**""Female character"" shouldn't be a separate sub-category, an afterthought... They're just characters, and how they are written is as indicative of an author's intent and character-work and storytelling ability as how they write male characters**. The level of criticism shouldn't be raised and lowered depending on the gender of the character. Whatever level of writing talent and character-work you expect for male characters shouldn't suddenly change for female characters in a story. And if it does, if you notice yourself doing this, if you notice yourself making excuses for the author and treating ""female characters"" as a lesser sub-category of ""character"" then take a moment to think about why that is and whether or not you want to continue reading that way. 

And yes, because I am certain someone will comment this, because a topic about women in literature can never just be discussed without someone needing to flip the argument, yes it goes the other way- if a female author consistently writes male characters poorly then they too should be criticized for their character writing.",Fantasy

Edit: Wow, I didn't expect that kind of response. Super happy so many found this useful! :)

Hey guys,

To make the fighting scenes in my low fantasy novel more realistic, I went to see a trainer for historical sword-fighting last week, both to barrage her with questions and to develop realistic choreographies for the fight scenes in the novel. Since I figured some of what she told me might be useful for you too, I put together a small list for you. Big thanks to [Gladiatores Munich](http://www.gladiatores-muenchen.de/) and Jeanne for making time! (More photos [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Sa-SZoWuP/))

*Caveat: I’m by no means a sword-fighting expert myself, so take these nuggets with a grain of salt – I might have misremembered or misinterpreted some of the things Jeanne told me. If I did, feel free to tell me.*

**1.)** **Weapon choices need to make sense**

Let’s start with a truism: always ensure your character’s weapons make sense for a.) their profession, b.) their cultural background and c.) the environment they’re going to fight in. A farmer probably couldn’t afford a sword and might use a knife or threshing flail instead, and someone who doesn’t want to be noticed probably wouldn’t be milling about sporting a glaive or another large weapon. Also, soldiers native to a country with wide open plains would be more likely to carry long-range melee weapons such as spears or large swords, than those from a country consisting of mostly jungle or dense forests. The same applies to situations: if your character is going to be fighting in close quarters (even just a normal house), he’d get little value out of a spear or even a longsword, as there’d be no space to swing it effectively.

**2.)** **Boldness often beats technique**

In real swordfights, recklessness was often more important than technique . The fighter who was less afraid of getting hurt or wounded would often push harder, allowing them to overpower even opponents with better technique.

*(Edited this because the phrasing wasn't ideal. Thanks for pointing it out!)*

**3.)** **Even a skilled fighter rarely stands a chance when outnumbered**

While a skilled (or lucky) fighter might win a two-versus-one, it’d be extremely unlikely for even a master swordsman to win a three versus one against opponents below his skill level. The only way to plausibly pull this off would be if he split the opponents up, perhaps by luring them into a confined space where he could take them on one by one. The moment they surround him, he'd probably be done for – because, unlike in Hollywood, they wouldn’t conveniently take turns attacking but come at him together.

**4.)** **Dual wielding was a thing**

... at least in some cultures. I often heard people say that people using a weapon in each hand is an invention of fiction. And while my instructor confirmed that she knew of no European schools doing this—if they did, it’s not well-documented—she said it was a thing in other cultures. Example of this include the dual wakizashi in Japan or tomahawk and knife in North America. However, one of the biggest problems with the depiction of dual wielding in novels/movies/games are the “windmill”-type attacks where the fighter swings their weapons independently, hitting in succession rather than simultaneously. Normally you’d always try hitting with both weapons at once, as you’d otherwise lose your advantage.

**5.)** **Longswords were amazing**

Longswords might seem boring in comparison to other weapons, but they were incredibly effective, especially in combat situations outside the battlefield. The crossguard allowed for effective blocking of almost any kind of attack (well, maybe not an overhead strike of a Mordaxt, but still), the pommel was also used as a powerful “blunt” weapon of its own that could crack skulls. Though they were somewhat less effective against armored opponents, the long, two-handed hilt allowed for precise thrusts at uncovered body parts that made up for it.

**6.)**  **“Zweihänder” were only used for very specific combat situations**

Zweihänder—massive two-handed swords—were only used for specific purposes and usually not in one-on-one combat as is often seen in movies or games. One of these purposes was using their reach to break up enemy formations. In fact, one type of two-handed sword even owed its name to that purpose: Gassenhauer (German, Gasse = alley, Hauer = striker)—the fighters literally used it to strike “alleys” into an enemy formation with wide, powerful swings.

7.) **It’s all about distance**

While I was subconsciously aware of this, it might be helpful to remember that distance was an incredibly important element in fights. The moment your opponent got past your weapons ideal range, it was common to either switch to a different weapon or just drop your weapon and resort to punching/choking. A good example of this are spears or polearms—very powerful as long as you maintain a certain range between you and your opponent, but the moment they get too close, your weapon is practically useless. That’s also why combatants almost always brought a second weapon into battle to fall back one.

8.) **Real fights rarely lasted over a minute**

Another truism, but still useful to remember: real fights didn’t last long, especially when only using light or no armor. Usually they were over within less than a minute, sometimes only seconds – the moment your opponent landed a hit (or your weapon broke or you were disarmed), you were done for.

**9.)** **Stop the pirouettes**

Unfortunately, the spinning around and pirouetting that makes many fight scenes so enjoyable to watch (or read) is completely asinine. Unless it's a showfight, fighters would *never* expose their backs to their opponent or turn their weapon away from them.

**10.)**  **It still looks amazing**

If your concern is that making your fight scenes realistic will make them less aesthetic, don’t worry. Apart from the fact that the blocks, swings and thrusts still look impressive when executed correctly, I personally felt that my fights get a lot more gripping and visceral if I respect the rules. To a certain extent, unrealistic and flashy combat is plot armor. If your characters can spin and somersault to their heart’s content and no one ever shoves a spear into their backs as they would have in real life, who survives and who doesn’t *noticeably* becomes arbitrary. If, on the other hand, even one slip-up can result in a combatant’s death, the stakes become really palpable.

That’s about it! I hope this post is as helpful to some of you as the lessons were to me. Again, if anything I wrote here is bollocks, it’s probably my fault and not Jeanne’s.

1612075372.0,The end of a 30 year relationship,"So roughly 30 years ago I was in a dusty military thrift shop in southern Arizona. My dad had just deployed overseas and my mom was ""thrifting"", a favorite hobby of hers. As any kid would do I wandered off on my own, eventually finding myself in the book section. It had maybe 40 books, mostly romance (those Army wives loved them some romance).

On the shelves I found one single book that looked interesting. Some strange 'The Wheel of Time' thing. It was a paperback and the thrift shop wanted 49 cents for it, and with at least two dollars burning a hole in my pocket that was a fantastic deal.

Once home I tore through this book faster than anything I had ever read. But it ended in such a cliffhanger. A really confusing, abrupt cliffhanger. It felt like there should be way more. And that is when I realized it wasn't a complete book! It was a promotional copy of The Eye of The World, by Robert Jordan. It was about the first 6 or so chapters. Imagine reading a great book and someone walks by and tears it in half and takes the entire ending with them. That is what it felt like. And this was pre-everything. I couldn't just pop onto my Kindle and be reading an eBook copy in a few seconds.

My mom didn't even drive, we had walked that day I bought the book.

So heading off-base to a legit book store was not happening. And the nearest book store was miles away in a neighboring town. My hopes were dashed. I did the only sensible thing I could think of: I grabbed my friends and we skipped town on our bikes. We rode off the base. To the next town. Across that town and found the store. And I found The Eye of The World in glorious hardcover edition. And couldn't afford it. Not even close. All of us putting our money together wouldn't have been able to buy it. I hadn't known how much new books cost, I had never owned one.

That thrift shop had ruined my economic perception of the world.

I rode all the way back home. It was the saddest bike ride of my life. This exact moment led to me and all my friends starting a thriving lawncare business to make money, but that is another story.

A few months later I found the book in my bedroom. My mom had bought it. And every single release day for the next 7-8 years, even though I had money of my own, she'd buy me the next of the series. It was the one gift she knew I'd love. It became our thing. She became almost as excited about an upcoming book as me, and she didn't even read them. But that was how my love of the series was born. When Mr. Jordan eventually passed away, with the story unfinished, it broke my heart. An author and a story it felt like I had grown my whole life with, gone.

In fact it affected me so deeply that, even after learning the series would continue, I didn't read the final 3 books. Not because I feared Brandon Sanderson wouldn't do justice to the story (I love all of his books, for what its worth) but because I knew it was over. After I read those final books, it was done. There would be no more story. That world would be over.

It wasn't until this week, years and years later, at the ripe old age of 40, I read them. And yes, I did put the last book down with a tremendous sense of loss. Almost a hollow feeling. Like saying goodbye to a friend for the very last time, and knowing it *is* the very last time. But also I just had a feeling of gratitude. For Robert Jordan for starting me on this journey, his estate for allowing the journey to continue, and above all, to Mr. Sanderson. The skill, love and respect you brought to these final novels, it honestly makes me emotional.

I don't know what the mass reception of these books has been, for obvious reasons I had never read a single review. I don't know if they were hated or loved. All I know is what I feel, and all I can say is I'm glad you were the one.

Thank you, Robert Jordan. Thank you, Brandon Sanderson.

So what about you?

What is for you the one fantasy saga big TV networks needs to get their hands on asap?

My personal answer would be Robin Hobb. 

She may be my favorite fantasy writer. She is absolutely a master at crafting brillant and deep characters and making them go on such emotional journeys...

And the physical journey is one to behold as well, she's just as good at building a world... from Buck to Jamailia, from the Rain Wilds to the pirates isles, the world of the *Realm of the Elderlings* simply stays with you.

And I would absolutely love to see it on TV one day... I know Robin previously said she wasnt really open to the idea but things have moved on, we live in a golden age of TV and some networks could really do with a prestige fantasy TV show. And the story of Fitz is up there in terms of prestige. Though I hope they'd go all the way in and adapt all sagas.

The writer in me would give an eye (well, maybe not) to be involved in adapting the entire story on screen.

But I'm curious to read what would be your top choice.",Fantasy

1607795386.0,Middle-earth from Sauron's Perspective,"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I'll be honest, I actually have a bit of a soft spot for Sauron. That's not to say he's in any way a good guy, but I do really enjoy his character, and I'd consider him (possibly) the most interesting villain in the Legendarium. Which is pretty nuts when we consider that he only has the *most* limited appearance on the pages of *The Lord of the Rings,* despite the fact that he *is* the titular Lord of said rings. The problem is that by the Third Age, Sauron was  just a (metaphorical) shadow of his former self, and by the time of the more recognisable elements in the Legendarium such as Gondor, Hobbits, and the Wizards, Sauron's most interesting days are behind him. So today I want to chronicle the Ages of Arda from the perspective of Sauron, and try to explain what makes *The Deceiver* such a great character. 

Now Sauron is a being with many many names, and way back in the beginning, no one would have thought to call him Sauron. You see what Sauron actually means in the Quenya language of the Elves is *""the abhorred""*, and so this name was used only *after* his fall into darkness. However in *The Silmarillion* his original name is never given, and when *Morgoth's Ring* was published 17 years later, all we're told is that Sauron was what he was ""*afterwards called.""* So what was his original name? Well it wasn't until 2007 that this question was finally answered. So in the 17th issue of the *Parma Eldarlamberon,* which is a book of Elven Tongues concerning names and words from Tolkien's fictional languages, which was written by the Professor in the 1950s but not published until *way* more recently, we're told that Sauron's original name was *Mairon*. Which means ""*the Admirable.""* And this is key to understanding Sauron's character. 

Because back in the beginning Sauron was not a creature of darkness. He was in fact the complete opposite.

Right at the beginning, before the universe was even made, Eru Ilúvatar (God with a capital G) created the Ainur, *""the Holy Ones, that were the offspring of his thought.""* Now the mightiest of all the Ainur was Melkor, and he was destined to become the first Dark Lord. And to be honest, in my opinion, Melkor absolutely sucks. After him, the fourteen most powerful Ainur are known as the Valar, and in some ways they're kind of similar to a pantheon of gods and goddesses (with a little g). And the rest of the Ainur are known as Maiar, sort of like angels or demi-gods. And one of these Maiar was Mairon. And unlike most other dark Maiar such as the balrogs, Mairon was not originally a follower of Melkor. Instead he was a pupil of Aulë, the Vala of crafting.

And this is also very important to Sauron's character. Because, if for a moment we remove all the ethics and all the morality from him, at his core, Sauron is the greatest craftsman ever to live in Middle-earth. And this love of crafting is central to his purpose and motivation. It's very important to note that whereas Melkor turned to evil out of a jealous desire to bring about discord, ruin, and dominion, Sauron's motives are much more understandable. Mairon was a lover of order and perfection. And as the greatest of the Maiar, he believed himself worthy of ruling Middle-earth and crafting his vision of a world without waste or turmoil. Now as is so often the case with geniuses, this desire soon turned to obsession, and before long, Mairon found himself admiring Melkor's power ""*to effect his designs quickly and masterfully.""* And thus Mairon was corrupted into Sauron, and *""for long he served another and not himself.""*

Now in order to keep this story moving, I'm going to have to skip forward tens of thousands of years, to the moment where Melkor is defeated and imprisoned by the Valar, after the War for the Sake of the Elves. So for three long ages, (which with a bit of Tolkien maths we can calculate as 2874.6 years as we'd reckon it), Melkor is locked away in the West, but Sauron is not locked away with him. Instead Sauron simply remains in Middle-earth, and he spends these long ages faithfully rebuilding Melkor's armies and awaiting his master's eventual return. And in this time we can speculate that Sauron may have given some thought to the future, and to the perfectly ordered world that he hoped to build with Melkor. 

But this is not what happened. When Melkor eventually did return to Middle-earth, he was angrier, pettier, and more bitter than ever before. And instead of crafting Middle-earth into a perfectly ordered kingdom, he simply wanted to pollute, ruin, and pervert everything that the Elves and the Valar had built. His goal was to corrupt Middle-earth into something obscene. And I imagine this must have struck a sour chord with Sauron. But still, Sauron remained faithful to his master. 

Now throughout the First Age of the Sun, Sauron became Melkor's chief disciple, and along with the Lord of the Balrogs, Gothmog, he was the Dark Lord's highest ranked servant. But unlike Gothmog, Sauron was no warrior. In fact in the entire Legendarium, he only wins one single fight. However it's at this time that we get some more of Sauron's many names. Because among the Sindar Elves of Beleriand, legend told of a dark sorcerer known only as *Gorthaur the Cruel* (Gorthaur means terrible dread in Sindarin), and this sorcerer turned out to be of course...Sauron. 

So Gorthaur did a lot of terrible things, and he killed a lot of innocent people, and it's at this early point that he seemed to develop a bit of a chip on his shoulder in regards to Men. You see, Melkor's great enemy were the Elves, but even in the First Age, Sauron developed a particular disdain for Men, and he desired to rule them all. This will be important later. Now Sauron's great claim to fame in the First Age comes with the tale of Beren and Lúthien. And I don't want to spoil specifics, but just before this story, Sauron invaded the Elven island of *Tol Sirion*, and he renamed it *Tol-in-Gaurhoth - the Island of Werewolves.* And it was this island that both Beren and Lúthien came to. But to be honest, this is not Sauron's finest hour. I mean to be fair, he did defeat Galadriel's older brother in a magical battle of music, he imprisoned Beren in a werewolf infested dungeon, and he also found himself in possession of the Ring of Barahir at this time, which I like to imagine sparked some sort of curiosity of his own in regards to forging magical rings in the future. But ultimately Sauron was utterly defeated when Lúthien and her faithful hound came to rescue her lover. 

And this is the last that we see of Sauron for hundreds of years. He fled from Tol-in-Gaurhoth, and we can presume he returned to his master Melkor, but he does nothing else for the rest of the First Age. And I have to speculate that things did not go well for Sauron when he returned to his master. His failure to kill Beren and Lúthien ultimately began a chain of events that ended with the eventual destruction and defeat of Melkor. And I imagine Sauron was severely punished for his failings. In fact, I would speculate that during this time, Sauron may have begun to grow resentful of Melkor, and it may have entered his mind that *he* would make a far better Dark Lord. 

Anyway, the next time that we see Sauron is after the defeat of Melkor in the War of Wrath. Now this was a devastating war in which the Valar basically destroyed the region of Beleriand in order to banish Melkor into the void. And so when Sauron returns to the story, he doesn't do so as a servant of darkness, but instead in a fair and repentant form. In fact Sauron even approached a dude called Eönwë (the highest-ranking Maia of them all) and he begged forgiveness and pardon. However forgiveness was not Eönwë's to give. Sauron was told that if he truly wanted forgiveness, he must kneel before the Valar and accept whatever punishment they deem worthy. But for Sauron this was simply too great a humiliation, and instead of facing his due judgement, he fled far into the South East. 

Now we can speculate for days as to whether Sauron was genuine in his repentance or not, but either way it doesn't really matter. Because by the time that the Second Age began, Sauron had relapsed into a being of darkness once more. Except this time, he was done acting as the servant of another. 

So with Melkor (and all of Beleriand) gone, Middle-earth entered its Second Age, and this is the Age in which Sauron really came into his own. But he took his sweet time in doing so. For the first 500 years, Elves and Men lived together in peace without any interference from a Dark Lord. Gil-galad was the High King of the Noldorin Elves, and Elrond's brother became the High King of the Men of Númenor. Again, Númenor will be an important part of what comes next. 

So remember how I said that Sauron fled into the South East? Well it's there that he founded the lands of Mordor, and began to corrupt many southeasterly men from Harad and Rhûn into his service. But unlike his later incarnations, Sauron was not yet openly committed to evil. After all, if there's one thing that's true about Sauron, it's that he is the deceiver. 

So by the year 1200 of the Second Age, the Elves of Eregion had become some of the finest craftsmen in Middle-earth. And under the command of their lord Celebrimbor, a brotherhood of Elven jewel smiths founded the *Gwaith-i-Mírdain,* which began creating objects of exquisite power and beauty. And it was at this time, that a divine and angelic being came to Eregion. His origins were a mystery but he introduced himself as *Annatar - The Lord of Gifts.* 

Now I doubt it will come as too much of a spoiler that of course Annatar's secret identity is in fact Sauron. And Sauron had not forgotten his ambition to craft Middle-earth into his warped version of a perfect world. Now I've found that when one Google searches images of Annatar he's often portrayed as an evil looking elf, but this is not the case at all. Annatar was astoundingly fair to look upon, and no one but the few absolute wisest beings in Middle-earth had any reason to mistrust him. And unfortunately for the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, Celebrimbor was not one of these few. 

So Annatar taught the Elves of Eregion how to forge Rings of Power, and together they created the first sixteen rings that would one day be split into the Nine and the Seven. But in secret, Celebrimbor forged three rings of his own, and Sauron had no hand in their creation. These are of course the Elven rings, and this is actually the reason why Sauron isn't able to dominate the Elven ring-bearers in the same way he dominates the nine Men into his Nazgûl. But we all know that Celebrimbor wasn't the only one to forge rings in secret. And in the fires of the Sammath Naur, better known as the Cracks of Doom, Sauron forged the One Ring. 

Now, I don't want to go making excuses for Sauron. He was a bad guy. But I do believe that if the Elves of Eregion had willingly joined with Annatar at this point, and submitted themselves to the power of his Ruling Ring, then all the ugliness that followed may not have had to occur. But of course it did occur. Because the moment that Sauron put on his Ring in Mordor, hundreds of miles away, Celebrimbor sensed his evil, and the days of trusting Annatar came to an abrupt end. 

So what follows is known as the War of the Elves and Sauron, and I won't go into specifics, or else this post would be 10,000 words long, but I have to say that it ends particularly horribly for Celebrimbor. His body is shot with arrows, impaled on a spike, and then carried around by Orcs as their war banner. But Celebrimbor's sacrifice is not for nothing. Although Sauron does successfully reclaim the original sixteen Rings of Power, Celebrimbor sends the Three far away, and Sauron never gets his hands on them. Now this war is long and bloody, but as is so often the case with Sauron, he actually loses pretty much every single battle. You see, although Sauron more-or-less defeated the Elves, he was in turn defeated by a great army of Men from Númenor who came to the Elves' aid. And I think this really cemented Sauron's hatred of Men forever. 

However despite the fact that Sauron lost the war, over the next few thousand years, he came to dominate almost all of Middle-earth. Slowly his power spread, and the way he did this demonstrates how Sauron is much better suited to political influence than he is to military might. Despite magnificently losing the war, by the 1800s of the Second Age, Sauron was worshiped by almost all Men in Middle-earth. During the following Dark Years, Sauron revealed his Nazgûl for the first time, corrupted the inhabitants of southern Middle-earth, and he (probably) burned the Entwives alive in their gardens (which is arguably the worst thing he ever does). In fact the only three places in Middle-earth that were really able to resist Sauron were the Elven refuges of Lindon, Rivendell, and Lothlórien.  And during these long years where Sauron ruled, he even declared himself the Lord of the Earth, and the King of Men. But that turned out to be a mistake. 

You see Númenor was not a part of Sauron's empire. It was an island nation that existed far from Sauron's influence in Middle-earth. And Númenor was the realm of the most powerful Men ever to exist in the Legendarium. So the King of Númenor did *not* appreciate Sauron declaring himself the King of Men. And in his arrogance the King of Númenor, who's name was Pharazôn, decided he would declare war on the Dark Lord and teach him who the true King of Men really was.

And this is pretty much what happened. Pharazôn mustered a fleet and an army. He sailed to Middle-earth, and he marched right up to the the Black Gate of Mordor. And just to give you an idea of how mighty the Númenorean army truly was, not a single living thing stood in there way throughout their entire march. When they finally did arrive outside Mordor, they were ready to slay every orc and troll that they found inside. But no battle ever happened. Instead Sauron himself came out to meet Pharazôn and his army, and immediately, Sauron knelt, and surrendered himself to be taken as Pharazôn's prisoner. And so the Dark Lord was taken to Númenor in chains.

Now I would argue that this next part of the tale, is one of the most interesting stories that Professor Tolkien ever wrote. Because Sauron came to Númenor as a hostage, but only 57 years later, he was responsible for wiping Númenor off the map forever! 

So in order to fully understand this, we need a brief overview of Númenor's history. 3000 years ago, back at the beginning of the Second Age, Númenor was was the most wonderful place. It was governed by great kings who ruled for hundreds of years and lived in peace and harmony with the Elves of Middle-earth. *And* with the Elves of the West. But this didn't last. Over the millennia, a shadow fell upon Númenor. You see when their island was first brought out of the sea, it was a gift from Eru Ilúvatar. But there was one rule. The Númenoreans were allowed to sail wherever they wanted, but they could not sail West. They could not sail to the Undying Lands. And in time, the Men of Númenor began to resent this rule. They began to resent their mortality which they viewed as a curse. Their relation with the Elves turned to hatred, and by the time of Pharazôn, the Kings of Númenor considered themselves enemies of the West and enemies of the Valar. Now all of this is great news for Sauron!

Because, as I've said a few times already, Sauron was the deceiver. He couldn't destroy the Men of Númenor with orcs and trolls, but he could deceive them into destroying themselves. And this is exactly what he did. So in the span of only a few years, Sauron went from Pharazôn's prisoner to his chief advisor. And he did so by playing on Pharazôn's fear of mortality. The older the king grew, and the closer to death that he came, the more he relied upon Sauron. And the greater Sauron's influence over Númenor extended. And Sauron knew exactly what lies to tell the king. 

He told Pharazôn a story. He told Pharazôn lies about the Valar. And he told Pharazôn about the one being who who was powerful enough to fight them. Melkor. *""The Giver of Freedom.""* So for the second time in his life, Sauron became Melkor's Chief Disciple, although this time I believe it was all a deception. Sauron promised the king that by turning from Eru Ilúvatar and worshiping Melkor instead, the secrets of immortality would be revealed to him. And Pharazôn believed every word. 

As the years went on, Sauron became the de facto ruler of Númenor *""from behind the throne"",* and he adopted his old name from eons ago. *Tar-Mairon - King Excellent.* Although I should clarify that the Númenoreans never used this Elven name because they hatred the Elven language, and so in Adûnaic (the language of the Nûmenoreans) Sauron was known as Zigûr, which means the Wise One. 

Now Sauron's rule in Númenor was brutal, and he made the worship of Melkor into the official state religion. A great black temple was constructed in the nation's capital, and inside there was a black seat for Sauron and a great fiery altar. Upon this altar The White Tree of Númenor was burned to ashes, and when that was done, the Kingsmen of Númenor turned to human sacrifice. Only a small number of Faithful Númenoreans refused to betray the Valar, and many of these were murdered in Sauron's temple. It was hoped that their bloody offerings would free Pharazôn from his fated death. But it didn't work. 

In the end, Sauron told the King that there was only one way to achieve immortality. He must take it through conquest. And so, Sauron convinced Pharazôn to build a great armament of ships, and to sail West. To declare war upon the Valar. 

And so *that* is how Sauron wiped Númenor from existence. When the first of Pharazôn's ships landed on the Undying Lands, Eru Ilúvatar himself intervened, and he changed the shape of the world, so that no Men could ever again sail into the West again. And in this cataclysm, the Kingsmen were destroyed. Númenor was obliterated, and not unlike the legend of Atlantis, it was lost beneath the waves. Now ironically Pharazôn actually got his wish. He was buried alive *""under falling hills,""* and there he will remain for countless millennia, in the Cave of the Forgotten, *""until the Last Battle and the Day of Doom"".*

However as it goes, Sauron himself was also utterly destroyed when Númenor fell. But he wasn't gone. He had the One Ring, and so although his body was lost, his essence survived, and in time he was able to rebuild. 

And this pretty much catches us up to the story of Sauron that we're all familiar with. Only 111 years later, the surviving Faithful Númenoreans, under their new High King Elendil, made a Last Alliance with the Noldor's High King Gil-galad. And after ten years of war the two High Kings eventually defeated Sauron in one on one (or I guess two on one) combat. However they gave their lives to do so. And as I'm sure everyone here knows, Sauron was eventually defeated when Elendil's son took up his father's broken blade, and cut the ring from Sauron's vanquished hand. 

Now we all know that this isn't the end of Sauron's story. His malice endured throughout all of the Third Age, but his days as the deceiver were over. Never again would he be the Lord of the Earth. And to be honest, I feel that Sauron in the Third Age is but a shade of who he'd been before. By the time of the Lord of the Rings, he was a tyrant and a lord of evil, but he wasn't really much more than that. He was a far cry from Tar-Mairon. A far cry from the admired Maia spirit who'd had so much potential so long ago. 

Sauron wanted to rule a perfect world, but in the end, the deceiver was deceived by his own warped sense of virtue. Perhaps the thing to take away from Sauron's story is the danger of believing that perfection can be forced through dominion. Or that order can be crafted by control. 

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on one of Middle-earth's finest villains.

1647060118.0,Unpopular Opinion: Most Fantasy Adaptions Would be Better as Animated TV Shows,"I don’t think this a popular opinion amongst fantasy fans, especially with cartoons and animated shows having a rap as being childish, but I think a lot of fantasy series adaptations would be better from this. 

Not only could the budget be utilized in different ways creating really cool animations, but with an animated TV show there is more room to tell the story, like in Harry Potter. For example, there could be more of the every day life at Hogwarts that drew people in to begin with,  along with the coziness and with a more fleshed out plot than what was possible in the movies. Plus, they could give Harry his mother eyes!

This leads into another point: presentation. A show like GOT is good for this. Due to budget reasons and the constraints of live action, things like the scope of the Wall, the  castles, the landscape, world, and characters had to have changes to be adapted to live action. This is one of the many reasons why asoiaf fans want an animated show when—or if, given GRRM’s recent blog post—the books are completed. 

Those are my points for my unpopular opinion, at least I assume it’s unpopular. I think fantasy series would be only helped by being made in the form of an animated show, though of course it depends on the series in question. 

I really hope to see shows/remakes done like this in the future. The biggest point is that they can make things look very cool and representative of the books their adapting.",Fantasy

1639292738.0,Anne Rice has passed away,">Earlier tonight, my mother, Anne Rice, passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke. She left us almost nineteen years to the day my father, her husband Stan, died. Below is a statement I posted to her Facebook page moments ago.


>Dearest People of Page. This is Anne’s son Christopher and it breaks my heart to bring you this sad news. Earlier tonight, Anne passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke. She left us almost nineteen years to the day my father, her husband Stan, died. The immensity of our family’s grief cannot be overstated. As my mother, her support for me was unconditional — she taught me to embrace my dreams, reject conformity and challenge the dark voices of fear and self-doubt. As a writer, she taught me to defy genre boundaries and surrender to my obsessive passions. In her final hours, I sat beside her hospital bed in awe of her accomplishments and her courage, awash in memories of a life that took us from the fog laced hills of the San Francisco Bay Area to the magical streets of New Orleans to the twinkling vistas of Southern California. As she kissed Anne goodbye, her younger sister Karen said, ""What a ride you took us on, kid."" I think we can all agree. Let us take comfort in the shared hope that Anne is now experiencing firsthand the glorious answers to many great spiritual and cosmic questions, the quest for which defined her life and career.  Throughout much of her final years, your contributions to this page brought her much joy, along with a profound sense of friendship and community. Anne will be interred in our family's mausoleum at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans in a private ceremony. Next year, a celebration of her life will take place in New Orleans. This event will be open to the public and will invite the participation of her friends, readers and fans who brought her such joy and inspiration throughout her life.

I remember that I really enjoyed it, and have been wanting to read it again. Unfortunately, I couldn't remember the name of the book, or the author.

Today, as soon as I woke up, the name of the book randomly popped into my head. I hopped out of bed, grabbed my phone, and googled it. Sure enough! It was the correct title!!

The book was ""Dark Waters"", by Robert S. Stone. Turns out it was a sequel to a book named ""Hazards Price"", that I've never read. I've ordered both books and cannot wait to read them.

There was no real point to this post, other than wanting to share my excitement. Not being able to remember that book has driven me CRAZY for YEARS!!! Anyone else familiar with it?",Fantasy

1641835945.0,"Publishing news: Amazon shuts down account of Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki, editor of Year's Best African Speculative Fiction, without explanation, refuses to pay out over $2000 in royalties","One of the best trends we've seen in fantasy and science fiction in recent years is the explosion in accessibility of non-Western fantasy and speculative traditions entering the global English language market. 

For those not familiar with him, Oghenechovwe Donald Ekpeki is a Nigerian SF/F writer and editor who has been doing amazing work to showcase African speculative fiction. He's won the Otherwise (formerly Tiptree) and British Fantasy awards and been nominated for the Nebula, Locus, and others. He edited the first Year's Best African Speculative Fiction anthology ([review in Locus](https://locusmag.com/2022/01/t-g-shenoy-reviews-the-years-best-african-speculative-fiction-by-oghenechovwe-donald-ekpeki/)), the award-winning anthology Dominion with Zelda Knight, and is editing the upcoming Tor anthology Africa Risen with Knight and Sheree Renée Thomas (current editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, best known for the Dark Matter anthologies).

The Year's Best African Speculative Fiction, which contains fiction from both African writers and writers from the African diaspora, rightly made a splash in the field, and I enjoyed listening to [Ekpeki's recent interview on the Coode Street Podcast](https://jonathanstrahan.podbean.com/e/episode-564-oghenechovwe-ekpeki-and-african-speculative-fiction/). He has in the past detailed issues he's had as a Nigerian in this industry, from being unable to use PayPal to [people not respecting African names](https://www.sfwa.org/2021/12/14/oghenechovwe-donald-ekpeki-african-names/).

Today, Oghenechovwe Ekpeki [posted this thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Penprince_/status/1480478847485325313) about a really messed up situation with Amazon. Ekpeki published the anthology through a press he set up, Jembefola Press, and so put it on Amazon himself. He was told he'd receive the accrued royalties in January (which he was waiting on to be able to finish paying contributors), over $2000 so far. On December 31, Amazon emailed him to say they were shutting down his account because he either had multiple accounts and/or his account was ""related to"" a banned account. He has no idea what they're talking about and they've refused to clarify in follow-up. They're saying all the royalties are forfeited.

It's a really messed up situation and goes to show yet another reason why we should be concerned with Amazon's growing dominance of the book market. Hundreds of people got this anthology through Amazon to read exciting new work and support the writers and editor in bringing it to them, but Amazon ends up with all the money, the people who actually produced the work get left out in the cold, and one of the most significant rising editorial talents in the fantasy and science fiction field gets banned from the largest global publishing platform. Likely because some internal system thought it was suspicious that someone was publishing from Nigeria. Now without access to the primary ebook market, Jembefola Press will have to shut down and Ekpeki won't be able to directly publish anymore (which affects at least an upcoming nonfiction anthology as well, for which he had already fronted expenses).

This subreddit is a great community so I'm posting this here for a few reasons.

* The anthology ebook is still available [on Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-years-best-african-speculative-fiction-ogenchovwe-donald-ekpeki/1139994697) in case anyone is interested in buying it. Hopefully those royalties will still make it through. Edit: [here’s a list of other places you can find it](https://jembefola.com/the-years-best-african-speculative-fiction-2021/).

* Ekpeki is going to do some kind of fundraising to benefit the writers whose payments are affected by this, so look out for that hopefully soon. Currently he's looking for a platform that he'll be able to use from Nigeria (GoFundMe is out), so if you happen to know one that would work, I'm sure he'd appreciate anyone leaving a suggestion on that twitter thread.

* Just a PSA in general that Amazon is no stranger to unethical business practices. Buy from other sources when you can, like local bookstores or online site like [Powell's](https://www.powells.com/), [IndieBound](https://www.indiebound.org/), or [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/). Even for ebooks, there are often other sources.

* This is just the latest example of barriers to non-Western creators getting their work out and being an active part of the field we all love. It's worth going out of your way to look for and support these writers and editors, if for no other reason than that they bring different perspectives and traditions to the table and that can produce mind-blowing fiction.

Edit: sounds like this kind of thing has been happening to a lot of authors on Amazon! While cases like this have the added barrier of someone trying to figure out these systems from outside the county, it can happen to anyone anywhere, and sounds like a nightmare to get anything done about it.",Fantasy

1596562620.0,"No, Mistborn Is Not Romance: An Essay on Romance Recommendations and Where They Go Wrong","This particular rant has been simmering in my head for a while. I did a twitter rant about a year ago that I have always wanted to rework into something more comprehensive and coherent, less scattered and hasty. So even though, yes, I can't deny the motivation to get around to writing and finish it has been inspired by a recent rather disastrous thread, it's something I've been thinking about for a long time.  
  
I am both a fantasy reader and, since much more recently, a romance reader. I'm not claiming to be an expert, I know for a fact there are people on this subreddit who are much more well-read and well-versed in it than I, but it pains and infuriates me that every time someone asks for fantasy romance recommendations (it's even a Bingo square this year!) the same thing happens: no matter how specific the OP's post, there will be a slew of unhelpful, hilariously off topic recommendations mixed with misconceptions and general uselessness galore. Since I'm eternally an optimist, I believe that one day, it will be possible to ask for romance recommendations and get recommendations that are mostly helpful.   
  
Now, let's clear up some terminology first.  
  
# What is romance?  
  
For a book to qualify as romance-the-genre, there are only two conditions:  
  
* A romantic relationship must be **central** to the plot somehow, if you take it out the story would not work. 
* It must feature a HEA (happily ever after) or HFN (happy for now) ending.^1 
  
These two are non-negotiable, same as fantasy requiring to have either some supernatural element, whether magic or non-human creatures (like vampires) AND/OR being set in a secondary world. Except with romance it's AND instead of AND/OR, it **must** have both. 

Now, with SFF romance, there will probably be some other stuff going on plot-wise. But suffice to say, if someone is asking for romance, the relationship must have *significant* pagetime and focus.   
  
Edit: You can also think of it like this, fantasy is a setting-based genre (setting matters for the definition, plot does not) and romance is a plot-based genre (plot matters for the definition, setting does not). So overlap is incredibly easy since they complement each other well, but they're defined from almost opposite angles.  
  
# What is a romantic subplot?  
  
A romantic subplot features people falling in love. It may end well, it may end tragically. It may feature two, or three, or more people. It may have significant pagetime, it may only develop in the last couple chapters. It's a common component and people have different tolerances and preferences. 
  
But, on its own, **a romantic subplot does not make a book romance**.     
  
# Where do recommendations go wrong?

The core issue seems to be fairly simple: to put it bluntly, **many fantasy readers here do not read romance and as such have no clue about what a romance reader would want or expect.**     
  
Mistborn is not romance.^2  
  
Wheel of Time is not romance.  
  
The Witcher is not romance.  
    
*Not every fucking book that has people falling in love is fucking romance.*   
  
Ignorance would not be a problem per se - not everybody likes or has to read everything, and I started off with definitions for a reason - if a vocal share of those who do not read or like romance did not think they are absolute experts on it and know better than those who do. Doesn't help that romance is coded feminine^3 and as such often looked down on, as if it's something lesser.    
  
Most books feature a romantic subplot of some sort to the extent it's incredibly difficult to find a fantasy book that center on friendships or family relationships^4. But said near-obligatory romance subplot usually isn't integral to the main plot (and often not done particularly well^5 \). While it may be a feature of the main plot, or important to the character arc of the protagonists, the romance is ultimately not what the book revolves around.  
  
Someone who is *specifically* asking for romance usually isn't asking for any old book that features people falling in love. And unless they are a clueless time traveller or a literature student, they almost certainly aren't looking for a romance in the 17th century sense of the word or any other alternate definition. Definitions change and deliberate, malicious obtuseness serves no one.    
   
# What romance is and what it isn't: a comparison

So, to highlight the difference, I'll compare Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson and A Charm of Magpies by K.J. Charles. Mistborn because it's the new Malazan and it being recommended as romance even though it isn't is a bit of a meme, A Charm of Magpies...honestly mostly because it's the first fantasy (= not normal historical) romance series I read that came to mind. There are other, probably better examples, but this is already getting long, so let's stay focused on two.   
  
## Is the relationship central to the book? 
  
In Mistborn, no, not really. It's not even close to the main theme, doesn't take up a significant amount of pagetime, and the book would still work without it. In addition, there is no chemistry between the leads and it isn't very in-depth.   
  
On the other hand, if you take away the relationship between Lucien and Stefen in A Charm of Magpies, there is no book left. It's more central to the series than the subplots about who placed a curse on Lucien in the first book, or the mystery of the giant rats in the second. 
  
## Is there a HEA/HFN?  
  
A Charm of Magpies: Yes.  

Mistborn: >!Given that both Elend and Vin die in the end, no, there is not.!< This would be an *absolute* no-no in a romance book.    
  
# What should we do?  
  
Really, it's the same as with any kind of recommendation request.  
   
* **Be mindful of what the OP wants.** The spirit, not the letter.    
* Be mindful of Rule 1. If you don't like or read romance, that's absolutely valid, but do not shit on anyone's preferences. Everyone is welcome.  
* Don't recommend a book that doesn't fit, no matter how much you like it. No, not even if it's your favourite.^6  
* If you don't have anything to recommend, upvote those who do rather than litter the thread with offtopic recs.  
* If you see someone rec something that doesn't remotely fit, in my experience, the best course of action is to gently (Rule 1!) call them out on it. Even if you won't convince whoever you're replying to, it helps the OP and it helps the bystanders.   
  
In addition, examine your own views. A few years ago I was the one looking down on romance, so this is personal experience. Think hard. Ask yourself *why*. Read outside of your comfort zone. If you want to write a book with a romantic subplot, do some research and read some romance or books with good romance subplots. I'm not going to say finding recs you'd like is easy, even without the barrier of people not knowing what romance is - I have friends who are experts and I still struggle.     
  
Romance should not be a dirty word. And we can all do better.

## Footnotes   
  
^(**1** And no, this is not a spoiler. If you have a mystery book, you know the mystery will be solved. If you have a romance book, you know characters will get together. It's a promise, the fun bit is the *how*. Journey before destination! :D)  
^(**2** See: the comparison with A Charm of Magpies below.)  
^(**3** *Coded*, deliberate phrasing there. By which I mean, stereotypically, romance is seen as something for women just as sci-fi is seen as something for men and fandom demographics would probably reflect that. Does it have to be? Are there no men who read romance and no women who read sci-fi? Absolutely not. However, sexism _does_ play a role in how genres are perceived and valued, and to say it plays no role in the way romance is disparaged, to say that romance is disparaged because it sucks would be moronic.)  
^(And just to skewer the bias once and for all, yes, romance has value. A lot of romance books I read recently have a lot of good things to say on consent and good communication. And even those that *are* mindless fluff - comfort and hope is value too. But others have written on this topic better and more eloquently than I. Essay-within-essay over.)   
^(**4** It honestly irritates me a lot that there's so many sloppy, half-arsed, forced-feeling romance subplots and so few fantasy books focusing on friendships, family, etc. Yes, falling in love is a common human experience, but not an universal one - aromantic people exist! - and *so are families and friendships.*)    
^(**5** Not nearly well enough by romance reader standards. Seriously. No chemistry whatsoever and little depth. I think the fantasy genre would be far better off regarding even the most minimalist of romance subplots if romance was more accepted and widely read.)   
^(**6** Not even if it's Malazan or Sanderson :P)",Fantasy

>J.R.R. Tolkien has become a sort of mountain, appearing in all subsequent fantasy in the way that Mt. Fuji appears so often in Japanese prints. Sometimes it’s big and up close. Sometimes it’s a shape on the horizon.

I’m best known for my “Legend of Drizzt” and DemonWars” series, and also for a couple of ventures into the Galaxy Far, Far Away…
(But we don’t talk about Chewy, no, no, no…)

My newest book, Glacier’s Edge,” was just released, and “The Dao of Drizzt,” the famous drow’s journal, will be released in September.

So here we go, Ask Me Anything and I’ll try to pretend I know the answer.


EDIT: Okay, got to run now for a bit. Have to finish this e-signing, give my little pup his medicine, and get ready for a softball game!

I'll try to get back to the rest later on, and thank you all for joining in and walking this road of adventure with me!

1596240916.0,The Name of the Wind: I don't get it.,"I just finished Patrick Rothfuss' The Name of the Wind, and I have to admit I'm flummoxed. A blurb on the back says to shelve it next to The Lord if the Rings as ""the first among equals"" which either speaks incredibly poorly about the reviewer's opinion of Tolkien, or of their qualifications as a reviewer.

I genuinely don't get the hype around this novel. Clocking in at a gargantuan 700 pages, the narrative goes approximately nowhere. Thinking over the book as a whole, I can't point to a single event of consequence that happens to the protagonist after the childhood tragedy that ostensibly starts his story. The tale, that portends to reveal the true story behind a legendary hero spends almost the entirety of its time on the world shaking question of whether or not the protagonist will be able to pay off his student loans. My hand to God, I wish I was making this up. The closest thing this epic fantasy novel, which has been heralded as the second coming of the genre, has to an ongoing conflict is predatory lending.

The author is talented, I suppose, but everything is dressed up in this tortured purple prose with pretentious of being literary despite the absolute absence of theme or plot. Much has been made of the world building but I found the world, it's politics, and level of technological development to be incredibly amorphous. Everything feels dull and static and  vague in a way that makes me wonder if the author himself even knows what any of the various countries, people, and cultures he tosses around are supposed to be.

And let's talk about this protagonist. Kvothe (pronounced like Quothe, because sure it is...) has got to be the author's DnD character or something, because Rothfuss LOVES him. He is a super skilled genius who is good at everything and, by the age of 15 is admitted to super wizard college on a special scholarship that no one else gets because of how clever and Joss Whedony he is. There is never a point where he faces an obstacle that he can't overcome with conveniently pre-existing knowledge. He is insufferably smug and good at everything and, despite the fact that the story sorta-kinda-maybe implies that at some point in the two books to come this arrogance will be his undoing, this volume does almost nothing to make Kvothe a sympathetic figure. Every character exists only in their relation to him. Every woman between fifteen and thirty flirts with him, despite his repeated claims (outright bald face lies) that he isn't good at talking to women, wise characters (with kind of one exception) exist to recognize and proclaim Kvothe's genius, and the primary antagonists are all comically stupid bullies who exists only to antagonize Kvothe for arbitrary reasons until he cleverly one ups them with all of his amazing skills. I would almost forgive all of the other issues I have with this book if the protagonist wasn't so deeply insufferable. He undergoes almost no meaningful change between the age of 11 where his story begins and the older, more jaded version of the character we see in the framing narrative. He remains a completely self assured insufferable know it all. I read most of the story thinking this older version of Kvothe, telling his story to a receptive chronicler, had to be in his fifties at the very least, but I was shocked to discover he was TWENTY-FIVE. It's such a bizarre choice given most of the story takes place when he is 15 and we are supposed to believe that somewhere in those ten years he becomes an almost mythological figure shrouded in legend and mystery. I can't. 

Imagine all of the worst elements of Harry Potter with 75% less plot progression and also Harry is a deeply punch able arrogant pissant for whom every subject is a breeze. That's basically the majority if this story.

I didn't write this to yuck anyone's yum. If you likes The Name of the Wind, that's okay, I just genuinely don't understand the hype.",Fantasy

Even original content gets complaints when there are Black characters.  There is never any explanation for why 90% of a fantasy or sci fi world is white despite the majority of the world being non-white. Nobody cares that the entirety of Avatar was Asian.  But if Black, there is immense backlash if not explained why they exist. I’m tired of the racist double standard and hypocrisy applying even to original content. People can suspend their disbelief for mythical creatures but not Black people. It’s honestly incredibly dehumanizing and reminds me that we haven’t improved as a society at all. I simply want to see women that look like me thriving in a world where we aren’t hated on sight.

Black people want escapism and fantasy stories of our own outside of slavery but the reason we have so few is because Hollywood studios only greenlight things that showcase slavery and overcoming oppression or poverty.  I’ve even had friends of mine on social media that work in animation and writing completely scrap original fantasy projects inspired by Caribbean mythology with a fully Black cast because of racist producers or backlash.",Fantasy

1582405609.0,The Definitive Scientific Guide to Eyebrow-Raising in Fantasy Fiction,"You all know what I'm talking about. A character cocks an eyebrow, or raises a sardonic brow, or arches an eyebrow. People like to joke about this when it's overused and since I'm a big ole nerd I decided to quantify exactly how often it happens and which authors like this trait best.

The results will shock and amaze you! Truly this is a study of critical and groundbreaking importance!

**Note: This is neither definitive nor scientific. I'm just doing this for fun. See the note near the bottom for real limitations in my methodology.**

Short Version: I tried to choose a spread of authors to cover different styles and subgenres. I searched the books in epub format, manually counted eyebrow raising, then divided wordcount by that number. Anything that means one eyebrow is getting raised was counted. Strikingly it's relatively uncommon for authors to describe eyebrows that AREN'T getting raised. I expected more physical descriptions and brow furrowing but they didn't appear much.

I'll lay out some notes later but I'll start with the numbers. The LOWER the number the MORE eyebrow-raising:

* Joe Abercrombie: 12,285
* Jacqueline Carey: Almost no single eyebrow raises, but 10,384 for both eyebrows raising
* Larry Correia: 14,125
* Steven Erikson: 6,000
* Robert Jordan: 9,838
* Guy Gavriel Kay: 54,000 single; 13,375 both
* Scott Lynch: 18,181
* George RR Martin: 88,500
* Patrick Rothfuss: 5,391
* JK Rowling: 128,500 single; 8,031 both
* RA Salvatore: See below
* Brandon Sanderson, MB: 4,037
* Brandon Sanderson, SA: 8,163
* NEW: Jim Butcher: 8,260 single; 10,738 both

&#x200B;

**THE NO EYEBROW CLUB**

* JRR Tolkien never has a character raise an eyebrow in LOTR. However every time eyebrows occur they are described as long or bushy (to be fair it's not many).
* Ursula Le Guin doesn't use eyebrow raising because NOBODY in Earthsea seems to have eyebrows. They're never described or referenced at all in the books I have.
* Robert E Howard likewise never once uses the word ""eyebrow"" in the complete Conan series.
* Robin Hobb uses eyebrow raises so rarely (like once or twice a book) that she gets to be an honorary member of the club.
* Salvatore has nearly no eyebrows in his early work (and zero eyebrow raises) but some later books have them in the 25,000-50,000 range.

**OBSERVATIONS**

* In the sample as a whole eyebrows were MUCH more likely to be raised than to be described in any other way.
* Raising both eyebrows at the same time is also not that common. Some authors never use this, some do rarely, and only three do frequently: Jacqueline Carey, Guy Gavriel Kay, and JK Rowling.
* The authors who like double raises like them a LOT. They're 80% of eyebrow appearances for Guy Gavriel Kay, 94% for JK Rowling, and 96% for Jacqueline Carey.
* If you count ""waggle"" then in some of Steven Erikson's books ALL uses of the word ""eyebrow"" are them being raised.
* Brandon Sanderson is the only other author to hit 100% eyebrow raising (in Mistborn 1). It was also rather repetitive overall, with the phrase ""raised an eyebrow"" accounting for 77% of all eyebrow raising. The exact sentence ""Kelsier raised an eyebrow"" occurs 14 times in the first book.
* I anticipated that some would object that Mistborn has a disproportionate number of writing tics so I also took numbers from Stormlight Archive. In it only 80% of eyebrow references were raising (actually lower than most authors on the list) and there weren't any phrases as commonly used. Average rate is still below 10,000.
* Patrick Rothfuss was the only person to challenge Sanderson on exact phrase repetition, with ""raised an eyebrow"" occurring 46 times in one book (62% of eyebrow raising overall).
* Robert Jordan was the only person in the entire sample who features eyebrows that droop expressively.
* NEW: By popular demand I added Jim Butcher to the bottom of the list! Early Dresden doesn't cock eyebrows so much but later books show it used frequently. What's unusual is that Butcher is the only author on this list to consistently use eyebrows in many categories. One book I analyzed completely was 41% single eyebrow raises, 31% double eyebrows, 12% other movements, and 16% neutral descriptions.

&#x200B;

**Methodology Notes**

The majority of the data was calculated by searching an epub version of the book and then tabulating by hand. In some cases where an entire series/author can be searched at once (like ASOIAF) I searched everything for more robust data. Other authors I take only one or two books as samples. I did experiment with testing more, but found that frequency of eyebrow raising was often consistent between books. If that isn't true for a given author, though, their data could be skewed.

I use the words/eyebrow method as an attempt to standardize, but it has limitations. Authors with a lot of back and forth dialogue are going to have more opportunities for dialogue tags than authors who write contemplative solo journeys. So it's an imperfect measure of frequency.

If any author uses ""brow"" in place of ""eyebrow"" then I might have underestimated their numbers. Expanding searches for ""brow"" would have included so many false positives it would have been a headache. Fortunately this seems rare from my preliminary testing.

&#x200B;

**THE THRILLING CONCLUSION!**

The implications of this study are profound. Racism, sexism, classism, grimdark, noblebright, postmodernism... these are words that have nothing to do with eyebrow raising. But if I've made you smile that's good enough. :P

Edit - The fact that so many other people have been amused by my little post warms the eyebrows of my heart! Thank you for the silver and gold, kind redditors!

Edit 2 - Well it seems like this silly post is going to be the peak of my Reddit career. I will continue to update the post and reply to data-based questions as I can!",Fantasy

Hi everyone!

My name is Mitch and I'm a small-time indie author who has today published the third and final book in my first-ever trilogy! I'm incredibly excited about it all, despite all the stresses along the way, and wanted to share the moment with you.

The Rising Saga is the story of three people who are brought together under the shadow of a war-mongering king who is driving his nation to the brink of disaster. Hopeful that together they can bring about an end to his reign and the iron fist he rules with. It's a story of friendship, loyalty, war, and betrayal.

Books 1 & 2 are currently free to celebrate book 3's launch today.

1646231344.0,RIP Priscilla Tolkien,"News [has sadly broken](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7703856341303488608/5403636253953328830#) that Priscilla Tolkien, the only daughter and youngest child of J.R.R. Tolkien, has passed away at the age of 92.

Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien was born on 18 June 1929 to John Ronald Reuel Tolkien and his wife Edith. She had three older brothers, John (1917-2003), Michael (1920-84) and Christopher (1924-2020). Her father read *The Hobbit* to her brothers as it gestated in the early 1930s, and later on to her before it was published in 1937. During the gestation of *The Lord of the Rings*, Priscilla helped her father by typing up some of the manuscript as it developed (Tolkien wrote his first drafts in longhand). Tolkien initially named the protagonist of the book ""Bingo"" after a stuffed bear Priscilla owned; he later changed it to Frodo.

Priscilla noted her father's ""complete belief in higher education for girls; never in my early life or since did I feel that any difference was made between me and my brothers, so far as our educational needs and opportunities were concerned.""

She gained a degree in English from Oxford University and worked as a social worker and probation officer. In August 1955, after Tolkien completed (at great stress) the revisions to *The Return of the King*, Priscilla took him on holiday to Italy, where he became enamoured of Venice.

After her father died in 1973, Priscilla was named as a board member of the Tolkien Estate. She became more active in the nascent fandom and scholarship surrounding her father's work. She contributed to the Tolkien Society and its periodicals *Amon Hen* and *Mallorn*, and served as the Vice-President of the Tolkien Society for many years (her later father is the President *in perpetuo*). She was a frequent guest at the Oxonmoot literary event.

Around 1977 she agreed to meet with Ralph Bakshi, who was producing an animated film based on *The Lord of the Rings*, and gave her approval to his concept art. The same year she gave a speech to celebrate the release of *The Silmarillion*: ""From my earliest years I recall my father telling me stories at bedtime, and in the darkened room as I was falling asleep I have a vivid memory of him retelling the story of Rapunzel and of how her prince sang to her at the foot of the tower where she imprisoned, telling her to let down her golden hair. This was brought back to my mind when reading the Tale of Beren and Luthien ... In *The Silmarillion* we have many shorter tales woven into one large tale of Creation and History ... It was possible for my father to conceive stories on both the grand and on the samll scale, and to have his imagination nourished by both the simplest fairy-tale and by great stories of the World.""

In 1992 she co-published *The Tolkien Family Album* with her brother John. She also took part in commemorations of the centenary of Tolkien's birth in the same year. Like most of the family, she offered no commentary on the success of Peter Jackson's **Lord of the Rings** film trilogy in 2001-03, but joined with the rest of the Estate in suing Warner Brothers for failure to pay royalties and trying to sell licences they had no right to, particularly related to gambling. After Christopher Tolkien's death in January 2020, she became the oldest and most senior member of the Tolkien Estate.

With Christopher Tolkien living in France for most of his life, Priscilla Tolkien became the more engaged of the family in the various fan groups and appreciators of her father's work. Well-known to be welcoming, charming and gracious, she will be missed.",Fantasy

It also just so happens that all three series are heavily fantasy oriented and have adapted and even expanded upon the world building of their source material in really compelling ways.

I've been quite disappointed with most modern fantasy adaptations in live action, but I hope that the success of these shows will encourage studios to put some big money into adapting some other beloved fantasy works from other mediums beyond video games in an animated format.

*EDIT:*   


*Just wanted to clarify some confusion about the OP.* 

1. *I'm not saying that Arcane, Castlevania and Dragon's Blood are the best fantasy adaptations by audience and critical consensus. I'm saying they're the best VIDEO GAME adaptations by audience and critical consensus. I feel like that's not particularly hard to prove.*
2. *I'm also not saying that animation is the ONLY WAY to adapt fantasy. Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, The Princess Bride, Stardust, Good Omens, American Gods, etc, etc, etc. all prove that it can be done well. I'm just saying that for magic heavy high fantasy, animation will allow the series to present the full scope and scale of both its magic and its world building, much more easily than live action would.*

It reminded me a little of Sting, so I found an hobbit to give you [an action shot as well.](http://imgur.com/a/cuc9Z)  

I'm deeply honored.  Many thanks again for all your enthusiasm.  If you've missed my previous AMAs, you can find two of them [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/k0fp8/iama_professional_fantasy_novelist_named_brandon/) and [HERE](
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ced7z/iamstilla_novelist_named_brandon_sanderson_ama/).  If you're curious about the progress on the third Stormlight Book, I've posted regular updates in r/Stormlight_Archive/. The latest is [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stormlight_Archive/comments/5p4ydj/oathbringer_spoilers_stormlight_three_update_6/).

I'll likely be answering through the weekend, as is common for me.  I might not get to them all in a burst this time, as I have an interlude to write for Oathbringer, but I'll slowly work my way through the questions, in order, as I get them.  (Though I usually have to give a cut-off, to prevent the AMA from being eternal, so I'm going to promise to get to everything posted in the next four hours, ending around 5:15 Mountain Time today.  I might get to more, but that's my cut off point where I'm allowed to move on.)

If there's something I can't answer right now (because the answer would include spoilers, or because I don't REALLY want to spend hours searching through notes) I'll post RAFO, a phrase I inherited from Robert Jordan.   It means ""Read and Find Out"" or a more polite ""I worry that the answer might give away too much.""

(Warning to the cosmerenauts out there with very detailed worldbuilding questions: I won't outright forbid such questions, but this AMA is intended more for the general public of /r/fantasy, and I'd prefer more general interest questions.)

As always, I'm deeply grateful to you all for your support in this crazy thing that I do--and, in more expansive terms, I'm grateful for how you treat everyone on this subreddit.  It is one of the most welcoming places I've found for fantasy discussion.  There is not only great discussion, but respectful criticism.  I love how you treat newer authors, or writers who are lesser known as of yet. 

You're a great community and I'm happy to let you AMA. 

Brandon

EDIT:  Golden Stabby Thread [is over here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5t9ysg/brandon_sanderson_golden_stabby_award/)

For those wanting background, I asked to be recused from the Stabby awards for a little while, as I worried my presence on Reddit gave me an unfair advantage over other, equally worthy writers.  The mods came back and gave me this award instead--called a coup de grace award--intended to be for writers who topped too many stabby award lists, and needed to take a breather.  :)  

Also...should I be promoting something?  I never know.  Something something about Rampart.  I do have a new novella [coming out next week, though.](http://brandonsanderson.com/mgm-options-brandons-forthcoming-novella-snapshot/)

EDIT 2:  And...time!  Wow.  Over four hundred comments.

It could take me weeks to get through all of these, but I will do my best.  I'm hereby calling this enough work for me to take on for now.  I will work through these, keeping this page unrefreshed with all the comments on it, and try to answer everybody.  Four hundred is a little overwhelming, though, so be patient--and forgive me if some answers are short.  Thanks again, everyone!  ",Fantasy

It hasn't been **that** long. Mr. Wood was in *Sin City* not too long ago... right?""

And then I rememberd that *Sin City* came out in 2005, and felt old. :)

I remember seeing *Star Wars* when it came out. I don't remember the where's or when's for seeing the first installment of those two franchises, though. I never actually finished Potter's story in the theaters, I was content waiting for the DVD. I remember *The Return of the King*, because the best theater in Seattle had a marathon, where they played the director's cut of the first two movies and followed it with the premiere of the third, the day it came out, and we had to camp out in line practically overnight to make sure we could get in.

I feel super old saying this, but--Wow, you've grown! I think you had like 60k members when I joined. So first, for those who don't know me:

I am the r/Fantasy Stabby Award-winning author of The Night Angel trilogy and the Lightbringer Series. I wrote in obscurity for years as I finished my entire trilogy, and then my publisher gambled on a rarely tested approach, popularizing\[\*\](#s ""I won't quite say 'pioneered' it, though their success doing it with my books led to other publishers trying the same approach. The romance genre did rapid publication first, then Naomi Novik published normally in the UK (IIRC?) but then published rapidly--and very successfully--in the US."")

the rapid-publication-of-trilogies by putting out THE WAY OF SHADOWS, SHADOW'S EDGE, and BEYOND THE SHADOWS in consecutive months in late-2008. The books just kept going back to press, and THE WAY OF SHADOWS hit low on the New York Times bestseller list a full six months after publication. Since then, for the last 11 years, I've been writing the Lightbringer series (starting with THE BLACK PRISM and finishing with THE BURNING WHITE, out next week). It's been a mammoth undertaking, and I am so delighted that it didn't kill me. I mean, so delighted to share it with you.

Due to the twisty nature of my plots, it's hard to talk about my books without spoilers, so please do remember to hide those as appropriate. Check in that column ---> under #2 for instructions. After that, it's on readers themselves if they click spoilers. >!Brent dies at the end.!<

He bent down and pulled his willy out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.

---------------

**""Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this."" said Hermione, raising her willy.**

---------------

""EXPECTO PATRONUM!"" Harry yelled. Nothing happened. Harry gripped his willy tighter and shook it up and down until a thick, whispy white substance prtruded from the end of it.

---------------

**Then, with a sigh, he raised his willy and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.**

---------------

""No!"" roared Snape's voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his willy and panting.

1705922153.0,I’m a bit surprised by the relatively subdued response to the Hugo Awards scandal,"Maybe I’m just naïve, but I’m pretty shocked that the Hugos/Astounding Awards were so blatantly rigged this year (I’m sure it’s a barn fire among those actually involved in the process, but I haven’t heard much from the rest of us normal readers).

I’ve seen a lot of people saying that they don’t care about book awards anyway, but regardless of whether you personally care about awards, the Hugos are pretty clearly the biggest, most well-known award in science fiction and fantasy. Presumably it boosts books sales, brings recognition, leads to bigger future book deals, etc. At least, I always see “Hugo Award Winner” stamped pretty prominently on the covers of the winners, so it must have some real-world impact. And this year’s awards, at least, have been pretty clearly tainted.

I’ve just been learning about this as I’ve been reading what has become public over the past couple of days, so forgive me if I’m missing or misunderstanding anything, but this is what I’ve gathered so far (important to note that Worldcon, the annual convention of the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS), which organizes and presents the Hugos, was held in Chengdu, China this year, and was therefore exposed to potential pressure from the Chinese government):

* Several writers were declared ineligible for the awards with no explanation. Most of these are from the Chinese diaspora, including R.F. Kuang for best novel (Babel) and Xiran Jay Zhao (Iron Widow) for the Astounding Award for best new writer. Both should pretty clearly be eligible according to the posted criteria. And for the Astounding Award, new authors have two years of eligibility. Xiran Jay Zhao was already eligible last year, so it shouldn’t be possible for them to suddenly be ineligible this year.
* The nominating [stats](https://www.thehugoawards.org/2024/01/2023-nominating-and-final-ballot-statistics-published/), released a couple of days ago, seem fake or corrupted, especially for the awards for best novel and best series. Both have a huge drop-off between the works that were eventually nominated and the rest of the pack. Such a huge drop-off, in fact, that the results would require that the vast majority of the nomination ballots contained almost identical lists of books/series. This [blog post](https://alpennia.com/blog/comparison-hugo-nomination-distribution-statistics) explains it way better than I can
* The Chengdu Worldcon waited until the last possible day under the WSFS constitution to release the nominating statistics (90 days after the announcement of the winners), even though they are normally released within days. They should have had all the numbers already, so why wait, unless hoping the Hugos would pass out of the spotlight and the sketchy stats would get less attention?

I feel terrible for the “ineligible” authors and creators, who were unfairly blocked from receiving a potentially life-changing award. I feel terrible for the nominees and winners, who probably experienced one of the best moments of their lives, only to see these nominating statistics months later and realize that they won a devalued award through no fault or knowledge of their own. I feel terrible for victims we don’t even know who might have been nominated if not for the rigged process.

And the craziest thing to me is that there doesn’t seem to be anybody who can be held to account for this. Everyone just seems to be saying there’s nothing anyone can do, because each Worldcon is its own independent entity and there’s no central governing body. As a science fiction and fantasy fan I’d always just assumed the Hugos were legitimate awards, but if they’re able to be tampered with to this extent with no repercussions, they really shouldn’t exist! It seems to me that if you’re going to create and hand out awards, you have some kind of responsibility to ensure that the awards are fair. If the WSFS can’t ensure that, they shouldn’t be handing out their bogus awards, and should just shut the whole thing down so that legitimate awards can get more attention.

Anyway thanks for reading my rant, and feel free add any other shenanigans I’ve missed

- He *is* working on it.  

- It’s hard! But progress has been made and he sounds very upbeat.

- The books are different to the show, and getting even moreso.  *”Some things will be the same.   A lot will not.”*

- Some characters who die in the show will live in the books and vice versa.  

He also explains in some detail his “gardening” writing style and the impact it has had on his writing, and why it takes so long.   *”Things twist, things change, new ideas come to me (thank you, muse), old ideas prove unworkable, I write, I rewrite, I restructure, I rip everything apart and rewrite again, I go through doors that lead nowhere, and doors that open on marvels.”*

The presence of blacks, my teacher felt, changed the focus of a story, drew attention from the intended subject.

These are the first words of Octavia butlers powerful essay, ""The Lost Races of Science Fiction"". These words written in 1980 would make me think Ms. Butler could predict the future. Her words hit home today even greater when conversations of diversity are more readily had, but came from a a time when people rarely talked about diversity and representation to this extent. The biggest reason for me making this post is because people haven't read her or this wonderfully crafted essay. It was 1980 and it didn't make a splash in the lit world. Partly because it was in a magazine that was only published once and was ran by a teenager. Thankfully it was collected in a book recently so it's more easily available. 


 I've recently re read it and found a few parts so profound I wanted to share them and start a discussion. I'll include a link to the the entire essay at the bottom.

-----

>Science fiction reaches into the future, the past, the human mind. It reaches out to other worlds and into other dimensions. Is it really so limited, then, that it cannot reach into the lives of ordinary everyday humans who happen not to be white?

>Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Amerindians, minority characters in general have been noticeably absent from most science fiction. Why? As a black and a science fiction writer, I’ve heard that question often. I’ve also heard several answers. And, because most people try to be polite, there have been certain answers I haven’t heard. That’s all right. They’re obvious.

>Best, though, and most hopeful from my point of view, I’ve heard from people who want to write science fiction, or who’ve written a few pieces, perhaps, and who would like to include minority characters, but aren’t sure how to go about it. Since I’ve had to solve the same problem in reverse, maybe I can help.

>But first some answers to my question: Why have there been so few minority characters in science fiction?

>Let’s examine my teacher’s reason. Are minority characters—black characters in this case—so disruptive a force that the mere presence of one alters a story, focuses it on race rather than whatever the author had in mind? Yes, in fact, black characters can do exactly that if the creators of those characters are too restricted in their thinking to visualize blacks in any other context.

>This is the kind of stereotyping, conscious or subconscious, that women have fought for so long. No writer who regards blacks as people, human beings, with the usual variety of human concerns, flaws, skills, hopes, etc., would have trouble creating interesting backgrounds and goals for black characters. No writer who regards blacks as people would get sidetracked into justifying their blackness or their presence unless such justification honestly played a part in the story. It is no more necessary to focus on a character’s blackness than it is to focus on a woman’s femininity.

On the various writing subs and even reading subs we see people talk about black characters as being political and only write them if it's relevant to the story. Or if they see a character who's black they need immediate justification for that or else it takes them out of the story. 

She suggests that writers who have trouble giving black characters interesting backgrounds and stories, and writers who get sidetracked justifying “why” a character is black, are incapable of regarding black people as people. She compares this to the stereotyping that women have historically received and concludes, “It is no more necessary to focus on a character’s blackness than it is to focus on a woman’s femininity.” This is especially apt because of her double identity as a woman and a black person and how they intersect. 



>Now, what about the possibility of substituting extra-terrestrials for blacks—in order to make some race-related point without making anyone…uncomfortable? In fact, why can’t blacks be represented by whites—who are not too thoroughly described—thus leaving readers free to use their imaginations and visualize whichever color they like?

>I usually manage to go on being polite when I hear questions like these, but it’s not easy.

>Onward, then. Let’s replace blacks with tentacled beings from Capella V. What will readers visualize as we describe relations between the Capellans and the (white) humans? Will they visualize black humans dealing with white humans? I don’t think so. This is science fiction, after all. If you tell your readers about tentacled Capellans, they’re going to visualize tentacled Capellans. And if your readers are as touchy about human races as you were afraid they might be when you substituted the Capellans, are they really likely to pay attention to any analogy you draw? I don’t think so.

This is something I've felt but usually don't have the vocabulary to accurately explain. I've seldom met a ""racism but it's androids, elves, meta humans, aliens"" metaphor that didn't fall flat to me as a black person. Butler takes everything I've felt about it and puts it on display. It always made me feel like white people couldn't emphasize with me as a black person when I talk about racism and discrimination but could completely get it if it was an alien or fantasy race. 



>That brings me to another question I hear often at science fiction conventions. “Why are there so few black science fiction writers?” I suspect for the same reason there were once so few women science fiction writers. Women found a certain lack of authenticity in a genre that postulated a universe largely populated by men in which all the power was in male hands, and women stayed in their male-defined places.

>Science fiction writers come from science fiction readers, generally. Few readers equal few writers. The situation is improving, however. Blacks are not as likely as whites to spend time and money going to conventions, but there is a growing black readership. Black people I meet now are much more likely to have read at least some science fiction, and are not averse to reading more. 

She touches on a question that is still being asked. A question that ive asked too when I was younger. I think the growing readership gets more diverse every year year! I think that the more we get diverse readers we'll see diverse writers get more chances and properly compensated because the disparity between award winning and exceptional black authors and new and unproven white authors is too high. [This article about the viral hashtag  #PublishingPaidMe into the numbers] (https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/6/17/21285316/publishing-paid-me-diversity-black-authors-systemic-bias) 

>A more insidious problem than outright racism is simply habit, custom. Science fiction has always been nearly all white, just as until recently, it’s been nearly all male. A lot of people have had a chance to get comfortable with things as they are. Too comfortable. Science fiction, more than any other genre, deals with change—change in science and technology, and social change. But science fiction itself changes slowly, often under protest. You can still go to conventions and hear deliberately sexist remarks—if the speaker thinks he has a sympathetic audience. People resent being told their established way of doing things is wrong, resent being told they should change, and strongly resent being told they won’t be alone any longer in the vast territory—the universe—they’ve staked out for themselves. I don’t think anyone seriously believes the world of the future will be all white any more than anyone believes the present world is all white. But custom can be strong enough to prevent people from seeing the need for science fiction to reflect a more realistic view. 

>A second insidious problem is laziness, possibly combined with ignorance. Authors who have always written of all-white universes might not feel particularly threatened by a multicolored one, but might consider the change too much trouble. After all, they already know how to do what they’ve been doing. Their way works. Why change? Besides, maybe they don’t know any minority people. How can they write about people they don’t know?

Custom and laziness are two of the biggest reasons why science fiction and fantasy has been kept so monochromatic and from the outside looks so unwelcoming to anyone who isn't the standard white man. Customarily she makes the point of people getting comfortable and people get upset at being told their established way is wrong. It's why people need to keep speaking up when talking about diversity so the laziness problem doesn't cone into play where people get complacent and they won't do the thing all writers have to do research. Thankfully butler covers that too. 

>But what do authors ordinarily do when they decide to write about an unfamiliar subject?

>They research. They read—in this case recent biographies and autobiographies of people in the group they want to write about are good. They talk to members of that group—friends, acquaintances, co-workers, fellow students, even strangers on buses or waiting in lines. I’ve done these things myself in my reverse research, and they help. Also, I people-watch a lot without talking. Any public situation offers opportunities.

Thirty years later, Octavia Butler’s words still hold true. Science fiction is getting more diverse, but minority characters are still sorely lacking. Books written by straight white men still flood the market, many of which conveniently forget the existence of people who exist outside of this demographic. However, Octavia Butler would be pleased to know that there are more black science fiction writers today than there were in 1980. Take a look at N.K. Jemisin, opens a new window, who broke new ground in 2016 by becoming the first black author to win a Hugo Award for Best Novel!

I don't wanna put the whole article up because it wouldn't fit and because it deserves to be read in its entirety. But maybe my words aren't enough! Here's a few excerpts from reviewers talking about the essay. 


In her review for the Women’s Review of Books, Nisi Shawl writes about

Butler’s long out-of-circulation 1980 essay, “Lost Races of Science Fiction.” A manifesto about the erroneousness of excluding black characters from SF because of the “messiness” involved in depicting nonwhites, “Lost Races” ends with a half-jubilant, half-deploring assessment of science fiction’s attitudes toward inclusivity and prejudice. “Times have changed,” Butler decrees. In the next sentence, though, she admonishes the field that “it still has a long way to go.” That her pronouncements on this matter hold true nearly forty years after they were first published speaks volumes about the slow rate of social change and Butler’s continuing centrality to our understanding of the fantastic genres.

A review in Bookforum calls it “a blunt 1980 essay on the absence of nonwhite characters in the genre.”

1541640421.0,"Today, two years ago, I started writing a sci-fi/fantasy novel. Today, a Big Five publisher bought it as a debut in a three book deal.","I still remember sitting down in a Sydney city cafe, sometime in the afternoon, and writing the first chapter of what was going to be my next novel. I had some prior outlines and plot sketches, but Nov 8, 2016 was the day I started putting pen to paper. I kept plugging away at it until, in May 2017, I had a first draft.

Today, on Nov 8, 2018, Gollancz, the science-fiction and fantasy imprint under Orion Publishing, announced that they’d be buying STORMBLOOD as the first book in a contracted trilogy, for a planned release in hardback and trade paperback in Feb 2020.

Still wrapping my head around that. But suffice to say, I'm pretty stoked.

For those interested: the book is mash-up of space opera and adventure, about the DNA of an extinct alien race that’s used as a drug, making millions of people permanently addicted to aggression and adrenaline. The protagonist is a former a Reaper, biosoldiers injected with this drug to make them super soldiers, returns home from a major war to find his estranged brother is possibly involved in the distribution of this drug and murder of his fellow Reapers. He's still fighting his drug addiction, and as he gets deeper, the worse his body's urges become. Things only get worse from there. And then there's drug traffickers, cults, and intergalactic politics on the side. Its very character and voice driven, and is The Expanse meets Mass Effect.

I packed so many of my passions and themes I love exploring into this book, not because I thought they’d be selling points, but because I love them. I imagined a lot of things would work against me: its written in first person instead of 3rd or multiple PoVs, that having an addict protagonist would turn off certain audiences, that the space opera elements are low-key, more The Expanse than Star Wars. So it’s quite mind-boggling for it to get picked up by one of the leading SF/F publishers in the industry. There's more info on the book on their announcement page if you want it: [https://www.gollancz.co.uk/2018/11/06/acquisition-announcement-stormblood-by-jeremy-szal/](https://www.gollancz.co.uk/2018/11/06/acquisition-announcement-stormblood-by-jeremy-szal/)

It’s taken several failed novels over the course of several years, rejections from both agents and publishers, and thinking so many times it would never happen, but it’s finally happened and here I am. The book’s been through a dozen drafts, and the first chapter was heavily rewritten at the request of the publisher, but it’s fundamentally the same book and caked with the same DNA I envisioned it in.

So, I hope this also serves as encouragement for writers out there, especially the ones who feel like you’re not getting anywhere. Keep writing, keep growing, keep plugging away, keep looking for areas to improve in. If you do, in a year’s time from now you could have a polished, final draft of a novel. You could have signed with an agent. You could have sold a book to a major publisher. If you hit the right notes, there’s no reason why it can’t happen. It’s all about persistence. In this industry, the only thing you can completely control is your writing output. Take advantage of it.

So keep writing, keep editing, and keep submitting. And one day, you could easily be making a post like this yourself.

ETA: Well, this sort of blew up. Wow. Thank you all - your feedback and responses have made my day.

A few folks have asked me to remind them when the book comes out, so I'll say here that pre-orders are disproportionately helpful for new authors like me. They tell the publisher people are interested, and they give our books the extra push we need to survive. In the meantime, I've created the book on Goodreads, so feel free to add it to your pile so you don't forget: [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42683840-stormblood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42683840-stormblood)

Edit: since so many are still bringing up race swapping I thought I’d share my thoughts on it. Race swapping for me represents a bigger issue with the film/tv industry: that they still aren’t adapting much by poc authors and many races are still very under-represented (native/indigenous and asian actors, among others, are rarely chosen). Everything these days is remakes and spin-offs.

Name of the Wind is my favorite book. I'm not a big re-reader, but I think I've read it five or six times by now. I've lent it to nearly a dozen people, and added their names to the cover, back before the cover fell off. I notice something new every time I read it. I've spent hours puzzling over its mysteries, and managed to come to many of the fandom conclusions all on my own. I've spent time contemplating how the story ties together its many threads by being *about stories.* The phrases stuck with me, from 'the cut flower sound of a man waiting to die' to Sim's shy blue eyed smile. Wise Man's Fear made me think about riddles differently, about exploring for the sake of exploring. The women in the books made me think ""hey, where are all the good female characters?"" So. It's not all perfect.

But I love those books. And any time I read someone feeling hurt or betrayed or disappointed that Rothfuss hasn't produced a third one, it saddens me, because I've gotten so much out of them already. I get that people who loved these books have been waiting a long time and have gotten frustrated. I’ve been waiting too. But not all riddles have answers; not all stories have endings.

The first season is kinda bad, the animations are horrible, some characters are blank and the story is boring. But do not stop there because season 2 and 3 are MUCH better, the team did learn from their mistake and greatly improved. The blank characters became very complex and you will love them, the animations issues are fixed you won't have a problem with it anymore and the story is interesting.

Season 3 started jumping around to different characters (kind of like game of thrones) but it never felt jarring or out of sync. Also we finally saw Xadia with beautiful magical landscapes and an elven golden city. The characters arcs keep getting betters.

Netflix took the show for 4 more seasons, this mean that now the creators are sure not to be canceled and can start working on long term stories. Season 4 might come in 2021.

 I'm writing this in hopes of turning  more people to giving it a try. It doesn't get a ton of mentions and  talked about like other Netflix shows. I don't want Netflix to decide to  cut it like it did its superhero shows, before enough people find it  and give it the ol college try. I want this show to do well. They  listened to fans after season one and continue to push the series in a  great direction.

**Edit**: First off, thank you to everyone who read, upvoted, commented, and awarded this post - it means a lot! Secondly, I wanted to clarify what the point of this post was. It was not to say that all people described as 'swarthy' by Tolkien are meant to be imagined as dark-skinned. As several people have stated, 'swarthy' can refer to white people with dark hair and dark eyes, but it can also refer to people with dark skin, such as Tolkien's usage with the Haradrim. Rather, the point of this post was that you could easily interpret the use of the word as meaning dark-skinned, or you could interpret it as meaning the example above, or any other way you choose. Any interpretation is valid and has a precedent in the text, and we should not criticise people for their chosen interpretation. Thank you all for remaining civil and respecting one another.

&#x200B;

The release of the teaser for Amazon’s *The Rings of Power* has sparked further debate online about the future of the series, much of which is based upon rumours and unverifiable leaks. One of the most prominent debates concerns the inclusion of many actors from non-white ethnic groups in the cast. I’d like to here lay out why such criticism of the casting for a work set in Tolkien’s Middle-earth is unfounded, and why such claims as ‘there are already many roles for non-white actors in Middle-earth, like the Haradrim’ are, while well-meaning, missing the larger picture.

I am not the first to approach this topic, nor will I likely be the last. Reddit user u/rh_underhill made a case for [diversity in Middle-earth](https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/nr8ge5/a_case_for_a_some_diversity_in_the_books/), and u/LincolnMagnus examined the [case for non-white Hobbits](https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/qbppgk/concerning_nonwhite_second_age_hobbits_focusing/), coming to a very reasonable conclusion:

>I’m not saying there definitely, without a doubt, *had* to have been non-white hobbits in Middle-earth in the Second Age.  
>  
>What I’m contending is that we ought to leave space for fans to dream.

The sparsity of evidence concerning the Hobbits, coupled with u/LincolnMagnus’ thorough treatment, means I shall be focusing primarily on Men within Middle-earth, expanding upon the work of those before me.

&#x200B;

**The First Age**

Already in the First Age of Middle-earth, from both *The Silmarillion* and the *History of Middle-earth* series, we get a picture of the race of Men being rather diverse. There are, of course, the Edain, the first Men to come to Beleriand, and there are the Easterlings, those Men who came in the final decades of the First Age.

For those of you who might not know, the Edain are three ‘houses’ of Men that came to Beleriand. While the overarching term ‘Edain’, itself meaning Men, implies some form of shared culture or ethnicity, the three houses are distinct from one another (although they do become related through marriage ties, and there is no reason to suppose that there was not some mingling prior to their coming to Beleriand, there is certainly much after the Dagor Bragollach). Likewise, the Easterlings are distinct from the houses of the Edain, and are themselves what appears to be a general grouping of different tribes under one name (more on this below).

The first house of Men we are described is the House of Hador. They are described as being:

>“of great strength and stature, ready in mind, bold and steadfast, quick to anger and to laughter, mighty among the Children of Ilúvatar in the youth of Mankind. Yellow-haired they were for the most part, and blue-eyed”**^(1)**

Additionally, in *The Peoples of Middle-earth* it is said that of this house “all were fair-skinned”.**^(2)** Therefore, it is clear that the House of Hador are meant to be analogous with northern Europeans, with their blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin.

The next house of Men described in *The Silmarillion* is the House of Bëor.

>""The Men of that house were dark or brown of hair, with grey eyes; and of all Men they were most like to the Noldor and most loved by them; for they were eager of mind, cunning-handed, swift in understanding, long in memory, and they were moved sooner to pity than to laughter.”**^(3)**

We get a more in-depth description of the House of Bëor in *The Peoples of Middle-earth*:

>“There were fair-haired men and women among the Folk of Beor, but most of them had brown hair (going usually with brown eyes), and many were less fair in skin, some indeed being swarthy. Men as tall as the Folk of Hador were rare among them, and most were broader and more heavy in build.”**^(4)**

This is a rather interesting description of a people as it appears to be so diverse. It appears that there were some who were like the members of the House of Hador, fair-skinned and blond-haired, but there were also many more of a darker complexion with dark hair, and some even being ‘swarthy’ (more on this below). To me, this variation suggests that the House of Bëor might have been composed of peoples from various other tribes, perhaps having been adopted during the wanderings that brought them to Beleriand. However, there is nothing in the text to suggest this, merely my own interpretation.

Last among the Edain, we are described the People of Haleth, or the Haladin, and they are said to resemble the People of Bëor, albeit lesser in stature.**^(5)** Thus, of the three Houses of the Edain, the people of two are of a darker complexion, meaning that, even before the Easterlings came to Beleriand, there were many non-white peoples settled there.**^(6)**

The coming of the Easterlings means even more explicitly non-white Men arrive in Beleriand.**^(7)** They were:

>""short and broad, long and strong in the arm; their skins were swart or sallow, and their hair was dark as were their eyes. Their houses were many""**^(8)**

According to Merriam-Webster, sallow means “of a grayish greenish yellow color”, while its etymology is connected to Old English terms for ‘dark’ or ‘dusky’.**^(9)**  Similarly, ‘swart’ or ‘swarthy’, as is also used for some of the House of Bëor, means “of a dark colour, complexion, or cast”.**^(10)**  Etymologically, ‘swarthy’ is derived from the Old English *sweart*, meaning “black” or “dark”, and other words derived from the same proto-Germanic root word, such as German *schwarz* or Dutch *zwart*, also meaning black.**^(11)**  Thus, the Easterlings of the First Age, and some members of the House of Bëor, had dark skin that could conceivably be black. If not black, then they are still of a dark complexion, given how Tolkien used the same word to describe the Haradrim.**^(12)**

**Edit:** Tolkien uses 'swarthy' in his poem *The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun* to mean 'dark'. The phrase he uses is ""night-swarthy"" (IIX.18), likely a poetic way of saying 'black'.

Thus, we can see that there were plenty of Men in the First Age that could be considered non-white. Although, considering that Amazon’s *The Rings of Power* is going to be set in the Second Age, at first glance it appears that the ethnic character of the Men of the First Age would have little to add to discussions of that particular period of Middle-earth’s history. However, the Men of the First Age, and their migrations that brought them into Beleriand and onto the pages of *The Silmarillion*, had a great impact upon the character of later peoples of Middle-earth.

&#x200B;

**The Second Age and Beyond**

Firstly, and perhaps most importantly for *The Rings of Power*, the Númenóreans. The Númenóreans are the descendants of the Edain, who alone of the Men of Beleriand fought alongside the host of the Valar in the War of Wrath - other kindreds of Men instead fought for Morgoth and fled eastwards after his defeat.**^(13)**  Of course, the various houses of the Edain suffered many calamities and great loss during their time in Beleriand, causing their populations to mingle with one another. For example, the destruction of Dorthonion saw the House of Bëor leave their homes and instead take up residence among both the People of Marach and the People of Haleth.**^(14)** Thus, the population of Númenór is composed of a diverse group of people, with skin tones ranging from fair-skinned to swarthy.

This same ethnic diversity can be seen in Eriador. In *Peoples of Middle-earth* we are told that:

>“At that time the migrations of Men from the East and South had brought advance-guards into Beleriand; but they were not in great numbers, though further east in Eriador and Rhovanion (especially in the northern parts) their kindred must already have occupied much of the land”**^(15)**

Indeed, we are told that even after the Edain were settled on Númenór many of their kin remained in Eriador or wandered further eastward, settling between the Misty Mountains and the Sea of Rhûn, but always far from the coast.**^(16)** In Eriador, the people there are said to descend primarily from the House of Bëor, with some being descended from the House of Hador.**^(17)** Suggesting a diverse population which, just as in Númenór, had skin tones ranging from fair-skinned to swarthy. One Bree-lander is actually described as such, and in a way that suggests that he was not unique in his skin tone.**^(18)**

&#x200B;

[Middle-earth in the Third Age](https://preview.redd.it/nnm7cw52d0f81.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=68e43abe74fd76e692ea47e1f3bfedb8dd828862)

Further south, in Minhiriath, along the coasts south of the Ered Luin, was home to ""a few secretive hunter-folk"", and in Enedwaith there was ""a fairly numerous but barbarous fisher-folk"" in the Third Age.**^(19)** These people, and the Dunlendings further east, are kin of the House of Haleth, the House of Men from the First Age described as being similar to the House of Bëor.**^(20)**

Further south again, in the land that would become Gondor, there dwelt a ""short and swarthy folk among them whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed in the shadow of the hills in the Dark Years ere the coming of the kings”.**^(21)** Thus, if we see the Númenóreans in the land that would become Gondor in *The Rings of Power*, they will be mingling with 'swarthy' people, people with dark skin.

It has already been noted how some people of Eriador were descended from the House of Hador, but they are explicitly stated to be in the minority. Rather, it appears that people descended from the House of Hador appear to primarily be located east of the Misty Mountains. The Longbeards (that is, Durin's Folk), who controlled the Misty Mountains, the Grey Mountains, and the Iron Hills, were most associated with Men who were kin of the House of Hador:

>""These Men, it seems, had come westward until faced by the Great Greenwood, and then had divided: some reaching the Anduin and passing thence northward up the Vales; some passing between the north-eaves of the Wood and the Ered Mithrin. Only a small part of this people, already very numerous and divided into many tribes, had then passed on into Eriador and so come at last to Beleriand.”**^(22)**

The most famous of these people is the Rohirrim, also known as the Éothéod. A tribe of the Northmen the Longbeards associated with that dwelt in the Vales of the Anduin after having fled from the plains between Mirkwood and the Celduin, or River Running.**^(23)** Faramir relates that the wise of Gondor in his day noted the connection between the Rohirrim and the House of Hador.**^(24)**

&#x200B;

**A Mythology for England**

The most common argument against the casting of non-white people in certain roles in Middle-earth is the belief that Tolkien was creating a mythology for England. Tolkien was, initially, but gave up on the idea, calling it ""absurd"", as his legendarium grew.**^(25)** Had Tolkien continued to write a mythology for England, the argument goes that the peoples of Tolkien's legendarium would resemble English people, or the Anglo-Saxons that preceded the concept of 'English'.  However, he did not, and as u/LincolnMagnus says, ""If Tolkien, in 1951, had already let go of his dream of writing an English Kalevala, I'm not sure why we as fans should be beholden to it seventy years later.""

Of course, I am not telling readers how they should imagine Middle-earth, that is up to them. The reader can choose to interpret swarthy as meaning 'Mediterranean', or they can interpret it as black, or anything that they choose, it is entirely up to them. However, what I am telling readers is that they cannot criticise other people's imaginings of Middle-earth when there is a precedent in the text for whatever they criticise. Ultimately, *The Rings of Power* is Amazon's creation, it is their choice who they cast, they are not making their show to match someone else's ideas about Middle-earth.

I am sure the Peter Jackson trilogy is somewhat responsible for this understanding of Tolkien's world. The Jackson trilogy shaped how many modern readers visualise Middle-earth, and the Jackson trilogy cast white actors in most roles, particularly the most prominent ones. There is nothing inherently wrong with this. As I said, it was Peter Jackson's (or someone else involved with the production's) choice, and there was likely nothing malicious behind this casting, with the choices made most probably being driven by expediency.

If you have read this far, thank you. I hope I have made a strong case for the inherent diversity of Middle-earth, and that, while there may be issues with Amazon's *The Rings of Power* (issues raised from unverifiable rumours), the casting of a diverse group of people is certainly not one of them.

&#x200B;

**A Note on Black Elves**

While a bit off topic, I would like to add a brief note on the skin colour of Elves. Several comments on YouTube videos criticising *The Rings of Power* express concern over the possibility of black Elves, despite the fact that we have very few physical descriptions of Elves from Middle-earth. We primarily have descriptions of hair colour, eye colour, and temperament, not skin colour.

There is an instance in *The Silmarillion* that tells us that ""Of all Men they \[the people of Bëor\] were most like to the Noldor"".**^(26)** However, this quote does not tell us anything about the appearance of Elves, only that they were like the people of Bëor, who are said to be ""eager of mind, cunning-handed, swift in understanding, long in memory, and they were moved sooner to pity than to laughter"".**^(27)** Yet, elsewhere we are told that ""the Eldar said, and recalled in the songs they still sang in later days, that they \[the people of Bëor\] could not easily be distinguished from the Eldar - not while their youth lasted, the swift fading of which was to the Eldar a grief and a mystery”.**^(28)** Thus, the Eldar themselves said that they resembled the House of Bëor, who themselves were fair-skinned and darker, some being even 'swarthy'. Black Elves are certainly not inconceivable.

The compassion on them. The tolerance, the antimilitarism, the sheer acceptance of others. The love for diversity. I had never seen this kind of message translated so masterfully. The tragedy of war.

""It's impossible to truly understand someone and not love them. Even your worst enemy."" Hot damn.

And then I found about Orson Scot Card, and as a LGBT person... dude.

I mean, I'm familiar with not liking the author of your favorite book. Bad people can write good stories and all of that. But this guy...

It's like he never understood his own words at all. As if he never read his own books, even more wrote them. I'm completely astonished. How can you write a treaty abou tolerance and love like that and just... treat people like that? To the point of actively taking the money you made off your book about love and use it to take away people's rights.

The message of the book is that we should strive to understand diferent points of view. So my dude, you're saying you're ok with aliens murdering people, they must be forgiven because they didn't know what they were doing. But real human beings loving someone of the opposite sex, that's too far...

1615137960.0,You can like hard AND/OR soft magic systems! THEY'RE BOTH GOOD!,"I've seen more than a couple of posts in the last few days in which people are having this fight over types of magic systems again and it drives me crazy. Look, I'm a huge hard magic system fan, and I love Sanderson books, but that isn't the only way to write fantasy, and anyone who says it is the *best* way is *probably* not reading widely enough and sticking to their Sanderson-McClellan-Weeks-etc. circle of authors. And on the flip side, I can love a good soft magic system, but just because it doesn't have rules doesn't make hard magic systems highly mechanical and lifeless! It just means you have your own tastes for what you like, and that's okay.

For this post I'm going to be using Brandon Sanderson's definitions of hard and soft magic systems. I'm using them because he was really the one to coin and popularize these terms in discussions of magic in fantasy, and because they are very precise and refer to VERY specific effects. I can't actually find you the specific moments in videos where he talked about these definitions, because that would take me ages and I would rather get this post done in the next half hour so I can sleep, so if you guys don't trust me I invite you to go look for those quotes yourselves, or else don't partake. But essentially, he defines these as follows:

**Hard Magic System**: A magic system in which the *reader* understands *most* of the costs/limitations/abilities in the magic system, and the magical activities in the story mostly work within the bounds of that understanding to get things done.

**Soft Magic System**: A magic system in which the *reader* does *not* understand *most* of the costs/limitations/abilities in the magic system, and the magical activities in the story work beyond the bounds of what the reader understands to do the magic.

You'll notice that these don't actually refer to whether the magic ultimately has rules or not, but whether the reader knows these rules. This is because, at least in Sanderson's view (and I understand that this can be debated), a magic system that operates on a lot of rules, but where the reader doesn't know the rules at all, can have the same effect as a magic system without many rules at all. He often cites *Lord of the Rings* for this, where people who have read *The Silmarillion* will be a lot more aware of the powers and limitations of someone like Gandalf, but if you only read *Lord of the Rings*, you'll experience it as a wondrous soft magic system. Another example is the Lord of Light magic in ASOIAF—there's clearly rules about what that magic can and can't do (because they can't just burn all their enemies with it with a flick of the wrist or whatever), and we do learn a couple of these rules, but for the most part we have no idea how it works and so it's a scary primal sort of magic that is exciting to see in the story.

Anyway, I would ask that you accept these definitions if only so we can get into the more interesting discussions below.

So I'm approaching this as a fan of both hard and soft magic systems. I think I enjoy reading hard magic system stories more overall because I enjoy seeing characters use magic to deal with conflict, but a) that is definitely possible to do with soft magic, and b) I've definitely enjoyed a lot of other types of soft magic stories as well. I want to get into some of the merits of both hard and soft magic systems, and I think I'll start with soft magic systems. Obviously, there are some things like a sense of wonder and stuff which soft magic systems are better at, but I want to dig specifically into what it can do on a technical level for a story.

**Soft Magic Systems**

1. A soft magic system can be a great source of conflict. While yes, a magic-user in a hard magic system can create conflict by being the opponent to the protagonist, a soft magic system can actually create conflict on its own. Perhaps, inexplicably, your soft magic system causes environmental problems every time someone tries to use it to do something—like you ask for a wish, but then there's an earthquake, or a wildfire, or something else. And maybe the thing you want to do is always done with some kind of an unpredictable twist, so you wish for someone to die, but inexplicably, that person comes back to life as a zombie and starts infecting everyone. This is kind of a silly random example I made up on the spot, but the point is, soft magic systems can create all sorts of conflict in your world.
2. A soft magic system can create awesome character moments. One of the things I loved about *Book of the Ancestor* was that the magic's limitations were never super clearly defined. The full extent of what the different magic systems could do was very vague, and we were supposed to buy the characters doing awesome things by trusting in their skill level. What this allowed Mark Lawrence to do in the story was that he could do all kinds of different things with his magic that hadn't been set up or shown before, but it was completely and 100% believable because we always bought that the character could/would do this with their skill and knowledge level. Similarly, in Harry Potter, we saw tons of instances where Harry or another character would use a spell we had never seen before to resolve a conflict, but we could believe that they had learned said spell because of their progress through Hogwarts at the time (and we see a lot more of this in later books, when they are a) in higher grades and b) more experienced in conflict).
3. A soft magic system can create deep fear. Besides a sense of wonder, which I already said in the paragraph before this list, soft magic systems can evoke a sense of fear which hard magic systems can't very easily. This sort of emotion thing, by the way, is something that soft magic systems are far better at overall, because when you don't really understand something, it's a lot easier to have it evoke emotion than when you do really get it. I'd say the best examples of scary soft magic are all in *A Song of Ice and Fire* where you have an all-you-can-eat-buffet of soft magic systems that are all kind of scary and things you want to stay far far away from. Similarly, even *The House in the Cerulean Sea* has this: >!We're never fully aware what Lucy is capable of with his Antichrist magic, and this is used to scare the reader, particularly when Lucy is having that nightmare and Linus and Arthur have to calm him down.!< Even in this wholesome story, we see a soft magic system being used to scare the reader.

**Hard Magic Systems**

1. This is gonna be controversial, but based on these definitions, every hard magic system starts as a soft magic system, because your reader doesn't understand the rules, and you can create a lot of story progression out of your characters learning about the rules of the system and exploiting those rules more and more to solve conflict. I'm currently in book 2 of the *Mage Errant* series by John Bierce and this is exactly what this story is doing—at the beginning of book 1, the characters can't use magic at all, and as we go through, we learn more and more about the sources of magic, the limitations of magic, and the different abilities that characters have and can unlock, and we get a lot of story progression out of seeing them grow in their abilities. The same thing is accomplished in *The Stormlight Archive*, where the magic is actually pretty soft through book 1 and much of book 2, and it isn't until near the end of book 2 where we see the characters have learned enough rules to start calling the magic ""hard"" and where they can exploit the rules to solve conflict. And this is one of the things that makes magic in Stormlight really fun, where we unlock more knowledge of the magic in every book, and yet we can see that there's still a ton more left for us to learn as the story goes on. So it's not just a mechanical, simulationist system—it's engaging to the reader because we are always learning about it. Your magic system **learning curve** is the rate at which the reader learns the rules of the magic (even if characters already know the rules, the reader still has to learn them).
2. A hard magic system can affect worldbuilding in complex and technical ways. If your magic system is like a tool or a weapon, and can be used consistently (as hard magic can), then your society is undoubtedly going to be affected in deep ways, at least on an economic and cultural level, if not political and social as well. Think of *The Sword of Kaigen*, where bloodlines guard their special magic techniques closely, or *Avatar: The Last Airbender*, where different Nations with different forms of bending have adapted their cultures and philosophies to their bending styles. Think of *Warbreaker*, where everyone has a Breath which is traded for on the market, and where citizens are forced to donate Breath to the gods to keep the gods alive, or *Powder Mage*, where hard magic using powder mages clash with elemental soft magic using Privileged across the world in many different countries. The point is, while soft magic systems do affect worldbuilding in important ways, hard magic systems can be ingrained into the fabric and pulse of society in ways that soft magic systems can't.

And there's more to say for both of these, but I'll leave it at that. As you can see, I read more hard magic system stories than soft magic system stories, because that's more where my interests lie and more of what's being published today, but I do try to seek out soft magic systems occasionally to read about, because those stories are always great (and feel free to recommend some to me! I've already got a bunch on the ol' TBR, but always looking for more!).

But all of this being said, I want to close with this: **both of these types of magic systems are great.** The tone of some of the posts I've seen on this subject has been strangely combative and defensive, where those who prefer soft magic are talking about how hard magic systems feel dull and lifeless and mechanical (which is perfectly fine if you feel that way), and they don't understand how people can enjoy them (preferences), while those who prefer hard magic systems are talking about how soft magic systems solve all the problems with little to no explanation (they don't, they usually create more problems than solve them, and if they do deus ex machina like this, that's bad writing, and I've seen this WAY more in hard magic stories than in soft magic stories anyway) or are all the same (literally read *A Song of Ice and Fire* or watch *Game of Thrones*, or read *Book of the Ancestor*—there's a thousand ways to make them unique).

In my opinion, this is a dumb thing to fight about, because it's so down to individual preference so what's the dang point? Let's go back to gushing about Robin Hobb please.

Edit: I should add, I tried to use more popular stuff as examples here because more people would be familiar with them. Sanderson tends to be a go-to example for hard magic of different types, but I tried to branch out to other ones that people would be familiar with to different degrees.",Fantasy

So since I disliked the other end of the spectrum, I jumped to the other end. But now days I like something that is in the middle, and more towards the lighter side.

The lightweight banter between friends, the humor that carries the light tone through the book even if there are bad things happening is what keeps me interested. When the book is all depression and grim and dark it does not keep me interested. I want the main character to succeed, I want them to be someone I like, I want to empathize with them but also I want them to be someone I would actually like to be friends with, someone who I can root for. It just creates a better connection, makes me care about the main character. Makes me invested in what happens to them.

And mythical and folk lore style fantasy elements in the story create this magical atmosphere, like the world itself is not ordinary but is magical. Like in ""His dark materials"" trilogy. Even thought that book has serious themes and sad things happen, the world in which it happens in has this mystery to it, it is a world of myth and magic. Same with Harry Potter.

I sometimes see people talking badly about ""childish"" books. I read a comment here that said that Joe Abercrombie's books are not childish but realistic and that is why they dont have a happy ending to them and that if you want those kind of books look at the children section of the library.

But to me childish to a certain extent is actually good. I dont know why ""childish"" is so often only used to relay a negative opinion of a book. There is a certain very comfortable vibe to ""childish"" books or books that are written for a younger audience. I dont think that all books that are also written for a more mature audience need to get rid of this vibe and be all serious and adult and dark with characters that are all bad people and where no one wins at the end.

# Epic Fantasy

* [**The Rage of Dragons**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41952489-the-rage-of-dragons?from_search=true) **by Evan Winter** \- This is one of those ""out for revenge"" type stories that get better and more complicated as it goes on. It's set in a Xhosa-inspired world that has a rigid caste system, a never-ending war, and yes, dragons. This world is also parallel to another world where demons roam the planet. If you ever liked **Red Rising** by Pierce Brown, and wished for a more fantasy-ish equivalent, this will scratch that itch. High-action all the way through.
* [**The Wolf of Oren-yaro**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36640276-the-wolf-of-oren-yaro?ac=1&from_search=true) **by K.S. Villoso** **-** There are few people who can pull off character-work like Villoso can. A queen known to some as the ""she-wolf"" leaves her struggling country to meet with her estranged husband, and the father of her son. Shit then hits the fan. We follow Tali as she fights for her country, and for survival.
* [**Age of Assassins**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33296298-age-of-assassins?ac=1&from_search=true) **by R.J. Barker** \- Okay, look, I know the word ""assassins"" is right there, and yeah Girton is technically an assassin, but this isn't the kind of book you might think it is. There's no sulking, silent badasses here. Girton is vulnerable. He largely does what his master tells him to do. He struggles. And the book and series are so much better for that.
* [**Lost Gods**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34804767-lost-gods?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Micah Yongo** \- What we have here is a multi-POV epic fantasy in a world with a brotherhood of assassins, which is shaped by the feel and wisdom of West African folktales and is laced through with conspiracies, betrayals, and the supernatural. Sounds pretty good, right?
* [**Empire of Sand**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39714124-empire-of-sand?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Tasha Suri** \- A wonderfully written Mughal Indian inspired fantasy. Tasha Suri’s writing style is beautiful and evocative. She has a talent for navigating the structures, quirks, and happenings of her world in a way that never neglects the emotional response of her characters. And speaking as someone for whom romances are more miss than hit... the romance here is sweet, complicated, and beautiful.

**Honourable Mentions:** [The Sword of Kaigen by ML Wang](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41886271-the-sword-of-kaigen?ac=1&from_search=true), [Master & Mages by Miles Cameron](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30344847-cold-iron?ac=1&from_search=true), [City of Lies by Sam Hawke](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36225135-city-of-lies?ac=1&from_search=true), [A Time of Dread by John Gwynne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34392663-a-time-of-dread?ac=1&from_search=true), [Master of Sorrows by Justin Travis Call](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39308821-master-of-sorrows?ac=1&from_search=true), [The Winter Road by Adrian Selby](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39088527-the-winter-road?ac=1&from_search=true)

# Urban Fantasy

* [**The Girl Who Could Move Shit With Her Mind**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41155087-the-girl-who-could-move-sh-t-with-her-mind?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Jackson Ford** \- What a fucking title, right? You'll be happy to know that it fits the book like a glove. What we have here is a story about a snarky woman with telekinesis, and a whole lot of shit going flying through the air.
* [**Paternus: Rise of Gods**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35621572-paternus?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Dyrk Ashton** \- The way I always pitch this one is... ""what if all of the myths and religious figures in our world were real?"". All of them. Imagine you could have Hercules fighting the literal devil. Norse gods battling with Hindu gods. Well... Paternus has all of that. And it's brilliant.
* [**Nice Dragons Finish Last**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20426102-nice-dragons-finish-last?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Rachel Aaron** \- This is the kind of book you read when you're looking for something optimistic. A goody-two-shoes character that isn't demonised for trying to be good. A dragon that doesn't fit the mould for what a dragon is supposed to be, but fights through that prejudice to just... be nice. It's simply written, and some of the series gets a little repetitive, but it's great. The audiobooks in particular.
* [**Magic for Liars**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34594037-magic-for-liars) **by Sarah Gailey** \- A bit of a strange book. It's slow paced in the extreme, and overflowing with mundane description. I'm talking ""a few sentences to describe a hand on a doorknob"" stuff. And yet... The level of description did mean that it took me a while to fully immerse myself in the book, but when I did, I really *was* immersed in the main character and her story. I've a love for broken things, and this is a story about a broken person trying to mend a broken relationship with her twin sister, against the backdrop of a magical murder mystery.

**Honourable Mentions:** [Jade City by Fonda Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43587154-jade-city?ac=1&from_search=true), [The Imaginary Corpse by Tyler Hayes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42873309-the-imaginary-corpse?ac=1&from_search=true), [Amberlough by Lara Elena Donnelly](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939270-amberlough?ac=1&from_search=true)

# Grimdark

* [**Priest of Bones**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37884491-priest-of-bones?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Peter McLean** \- This is basically magical Peaky Blinders. And it's every bit as fucking good as that sounds. The voice in this one is just so infectious, you'll find your inner-monologue speaking like Tomas Piety for days. It's dark, brutal, brilliant.
* [**We Ride the Storm**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39781307-we-ride-the-storm?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Devin Madson** \- I've yelled about this book on here a lot. One of the best self-published books I've ever read. Three characters, all in first-person, all struggling to survive in a world with so much violence and politicking that it just won't leave them at peace.
* [**The Poppy War**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068705-the-poppy-war?ac=1&from_search=true) **by R.F. Kuang** \- Drop a tab of acid, call the gods, burn every fucking one of your enemies to a crisp. That's basically how this goes. Of all the books here, this is probably the darkest. Based on some of the darkest points of Chinese history, it doesn't shy away from any of the shit that actually happened in real life. A hell of a book.
* [**The Court of Broken Knives**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32469783-the-court-of-broken-knives?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Anna Smith Spark** \- Talk about an infectious voice. The Court of Broken Knives is stylized to a fucking ridiculous level, and I mean that as a compliment. So much violence. So much fucked-up shit. Characters that are fucked in the head. And through it all: Death. Death. Death.

# High-Concept Fantasy

* [**This is How You Lose the Time War**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36516585-this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone** \- Cards on the table, one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. It's basically a love story. No, scratch that. It's basically the best love story of the past few years. Two time-traveling operatives of two enemy factions meet throughout the centuries, and re-write history just for a chance to talk to each other. Dueling POVs, dueling perspectives. Or maybe not.
* [**The Ingenious**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40531014-the-ingenious?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Darius Hinks** \- I don't even know where to begin explaining this one. Crazy shit happens to crazy people. Go read the blurb and a few of the reviews. It's insane. It's great.
* [**The Gutter Prayer**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39836383-the-gutter-prayer) **by Gareth Hanrahan** \- A girl, a ghoul, and a stoneman walk into a bar. The bar explodes. A god shows up and kicks the shit out of all them, then a policeman dressed up as a candle shows up and they all run away because those tallowman bastards are *scary*. A fucking excellent book.
* [**Shadows of the Short Days**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40041298-shadows-of-the-short-days) **by Alexander Dan Vilhjálmsson** \- A translation of the Icelandic fantasy novel ""Hrimland"". What we have here is a revolution on the go, with a half-elf who wants to tear down the government, and a mad wizard who wants as much power as it is possible for him to hold. It doesn't shirk away from exploring the nasty side of revolutions. It doesn't shirk away from much at all. It's not really like anything else I've ever read before.

**Honourable Mentions:** [The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43521657-the-ten-thousand-doors-of-january?ac=1&from_search=true), [Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42036538-gideon-the-ninth?ac=1&from_search=true), [Foundryside by Robert Jackson Bennett](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37173847-foundryside?ac=1&from_search=true), [The Ninth Rain by Jen Williams](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29758013-the-ninth-rain?ac=1&from_search=true)

# LitRPG

* [**Death March**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39980416-death-march) **by Phil Tucker** \- If ""bingeable"" was a word in the dictionary, the cover for this book would be the picture they'd use. Not too heavy on the stats, but they're definitely there. A standard ""guy ends up in a video game that turns out to be real"" plot, but so, so fun.
* [**Stuff and Nonsense**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37654736-stuff-and-nonsense) **by Andrew Seiple** \- A LitRPG from the perspective of a teddy bear golem. It can't speak. It can't really do much of anything, to be honest. But it stumbles from situation to situation, levelling up as it goes. An incredibly fun book. In my opinion, the sequels aren't as good, but this one at least is hilarious, charming, and just plain worth reading. Also, Tim Gerard Reynolds reads the audiobook.
* [**The Wandering Inn**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41033158-the-wandering-inn) **by Pirateaba** \- This one is a web-serial, but it's a great web-serial. Erin finds herself in a world that runs based on the laws of a videogame, only to the inhabitants this is just how the world has always worked. Does she use her video game knowledge to take over the world? Does she fight evil? No. She opens an inn and starts selling pasta.
* [**Forever Fantasy Online**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204341-forever-fantasy-online) **by Rachel Aaron & Travis Bach** \- A similar premise to Death March (a LOT of LitRPGs use the same tropes) but perhaps slightly darker, and with more than one POV. Worth reading just for that one dude who gets stuck in his big-tittied cat avatar body.

**Honourable Mentions:** [New Game Minus by Sarah Lin](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42847216)

# Fairytale/Mythical Fantasy

* [**The Bear and the Nightingale**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489134-the-bear-and-the-nightingale) **by Katherine Arden** \- An incredibly atmospheric book set in medieval Russia, following a girl with a touch of magic in her as the natural magics fade away with the introduction of Christianity. Some of my favourite prose in the genre.
* [**Spinning Silver**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36896898-spinning-silver) **&** [**Uprooted**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22544764-uprooted?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Naomi Novik** \- two books inspired by the stories of Rapunzel and Rumpelstiltskin. Novik moulds these inspirations with some fantastic world-building to create atmospheric books with strong women characters that you want to root for.
* [**Brightfall**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41946234-brightfall) **by Jaime Lee Moyer** \- Okay, so what if Maid Marian was a witch and Robin Hood was a bit of a prick? And what if there was a curse on all Robin's old mates, and Marian had to fight her way through fae-infested Sherwood to find the cause? That's Brightfall.
* [**Under the Pendulum Sun**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34643773-under-the-pendulum-sun) **by Jeannette Ng** \- This book is just so well written, and explores the fae-realm in a way that leaves you feeling so incredibly uncomfortable. A sister travels to the world of the fae to meet her brother, who is attempting to convert them to christianity. When she arrives, her brother is not there, and all she has are the members of his household for company. Slow-paced and spooky.
* [**Yarnsworld**](https://www.goodreads.com/series/193808-yarnsworld) **by Benedict Patrick** \- These books are almost like a revival of the Brothers Grimm, but with original worlds moulded based on fairytales and myths from our world, and Patrick's imagination. You can pick these up in basically any order, and while the first one is notably the weakest, they're all pretty great.

# Science Fiction

Yeah, yeah. ""It's not fantasy"", I know. If you don't like it, you can just skip over this part. If you want even more great books though, I'd pay attention.

* [**Anything**](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8389735.Becky_Chambers) **by Becky Chambers** \- Seriously. The Wayfarer's series won a Hugo for a reason. These are THEE books you read if you're having a bad day. They never fail to make me feel better. High-concept sci-fi with aliens and lots and lots of feelings.
* [**The Vela**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43472049-the-vela?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Serialbox** \- This is a serialized story about a solar system with a dying star, and a conspiracy revolving around a missing refugee ship. Rather than tell you any more, I'm just gonna list the INSANE list of authors that worked on this: S.L. Huang, Becky Chambers, Rivers Solomon, and Yoon Ha Lee.
* [**Rosewater**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38362809-rosewater?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Tade Thompson** \- A recent winner of the Arthur C. Clark award, and for a reason. This book is fucking good. A ""biopunk"" story about an alien dome that turns up in Nigeria with mysterious healing powers, and about a man who can read minds, but still can't understand humans. A masterclass in worldbuilding.

# Assorted Other Stuff to Read Anyway

* [**Undoing of Arlo Knott**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46822913-the-undoing-of-arlo-knott?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Heather Child** \- Dude basically has an ""undo button"", and we learn how using this shapes his life, who he is, and those around him.
* [**Orconomics**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25326486-orconomics?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Zachary Pike** \- A comic fantasy that plays with the concept of hunting monsters and other ""evil creatures"" for gold, and the subsequent financial nonsense that follows when you base your entire economy around such a fucking stupid thing.
* [**Nevernight**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114463-nevernight?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Jay Kristoff** \- Stabby girl stabs lots of people and gets stabbed in turn, in all senses of the word. Smutty violent fantasy with a talking cat-of-shadows that is snarky as fuck.
* [**The Black God's Drums**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38118138-the-black-god-s-drums?from_search=true) **by P. Djèlí Clark** \- A fucking incredible novella. Amazing worldbuilding. My only complaint is that I wish it were a full-sized novel.
* [**Miranda In Milan**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39947822-miranda-in-milan?ac=1&from_search=true) **by Katharine Duckett** \- An F/F (or maybe bi) novella that reimagines the consequences of Shakespeare's The Tempest. Slightly strange, slightly unsettling, but very sweet. The writing flows like beer at a stag party.

Aaand, well. That's it. Here are nearly 50 great fantasy books for you to kill your TBR with. Not all will be to everyone's tastes, so click away and those Goodreads links and see what seems up your alley!

I'm aware that I may have made typos, or that things might not strictly be in the correct subgenres, or that I haven't mentioned <this thing> or <that thing> in my descriptions, or that X or Y deserves more than being ""just an honourable mention"", but hey... otherwise it was just gonna look even more like a big ol' list of bullet-points.

I've tried to keep this to authors that don't get much talk on this sub, and to keep it to more recent releases, so hopefully there's something up there that spikes your interest and that you haven't read before. Happy reading!",Fantasy

1624714092.0,It saddens me that some of the best fantasy novels won't be read by many people.,"I'm a Swedish Fantasy author. My first novel got published last year, written in swedish. I'm also a big lover of fantasy books since childhood. Here in Sweden, fantasy isn't a big genre like in the Anglo-American world. Not from lack of readers, but from the lack of interest from the big publishing houses. Crime novels are king here in Sweden. The big genre. The one that every swede and their cat reads. Feelgood has a pretty big precence as well, as long with romance and non fiction. The fantasy books that sell in many copies here are mostly translated from english. Despite this a small but dedicated band of authors, book fans and small publishing houses have begun to write, read and publish swedish fantasy novels. I am one of the authors. As the scene is small, we support each other as authors, and as fans. 

Having been on this scene since 2015, I've noticed that many of the swedish fantasy novels are of really high quality. I'm talking Brandon Sandersson, Joe Abercrombie, Robert Jordan, Scott Lynch etc kind of quality. I'm reading a book right now, ""Skärvor av en brusten värld"" (Shards of A Broken World) by swedish author Matias Kuldkepp. His book is a 10/10 Masterpiece. Easily one of the best books I've ever read. If Kuldkepp was english/american, and famous, he would be hailed as the new Sandersson. And he deserves to become famous. His books deserves to become world wide bestsellers. Instead his books will be sold in a few hundred copies at most, and wont be translated to english, since that is expensive for a small time author to afford. And since agents only want to get the publishing rights for books that's allready famous in their home countries, that is a really hard problem. It is the same thing with another swedish fantasy trilogy I've been reading since 2016. The last part came out this year, really high quality. With an awesome story, world and characters. 

I don't know what to do about this. Obviously I'm partial as an author myself. I want the swedish fantasy novels to succeed as much as possible. I dream of them becoming translated by a big, english/american publishing house some day. Not only my own novel and the sequels I'm writing, but every good swedish fantasy novel. Simply put you english/american/world wide readers good in english don't know what you are missing! I'm feeling frustrated and just want to went. If people have soutions that would be awesome. If people are understanding that's equally good.",Fantasy

1541709675.0,Wizard's First Rule Rant,"Sorry about this, but... I had to. I had to. If you care to read on you'll understand.

A couple people who pay really, really close attention to r/fantasy posts may recall that a while ago I was given a copy of Wizard's First Rule by Terry Goodkind. I was, umm, hesitant to read it, from what I'd heard, but I just proceeded to tell myself that it surely couldn't be that bad - they say it doesn't get worse until the later books anyway, right?

Holy shit. Just... holy shit. I did not realize.

I mean, it started off on a decent note. Cliched, yes, but noble country boy teams up with a badass wizard to save the kingdom is still an enjoyable premise. Expository, yes, but it was from the 90s, fantasy writing has changed a lot in the past 30 years. But by the Light, were parts of this book contrived! Kahlan happens onto where Richard, the hero, ends up walking - fair. Richard just happened to have the special book memorized in his head, *and* be the Seeker - well, I guess I can roll with that, narrative causality and all.

But. Apples are poisonous in the Midlands because the wizards just *happened* to have a ""turn all food of a certain color poisonous forever and ever"" spell lying around somewhere (and what does that even mean, to *have* a spell? It was taken from them, somehow...), and no it can't be reversed and also it only works once, because reasons, and also it's range limited, and also who knows there the hell the spell came from - and then Darken Rahl (or Panis Rahl, not caring right now) got his hands on it through no adequately explained method and used it because ""children like red fruit"". 

And all of this set up just for like three moments where people got weirded out by Richard eating an apple, and as a contrived excuse for him to not have to have sex at one point.

**WHAT THE FUCK**.

Also, this is a bit of a non sequitur, but the Wheel of Time ripoffs are abundant. Now, I want to be careful about what I refer to as a ""ripoff"", because lots of fantasy has similarities. But this one really goes for it - there's a type of magic that women possess, and men who are born with it are considered extremely dangerous because of a time way long ago when a bunch of men got together, went crazy, and ushered in an age of Darkness. Sound familiar, WoT fans? What about the women from a foreign land who have special collars that allow them to control people in a large number of extremely specific ways, including making them feel pain, have an inability to move if they put the collar down, and being able to turn their magic against them? That's almost past ripoff and straight to fucking *stealing*. It even has, and I swear I'm not kidding, multiple times where a woman crosses her arms under her breasts. He's down to using *written tics* from the late Jordan.


Even then I was willing to call the book all right - until Darken Rahl and Demmin Nass showed up and had a conversation that went something like, and I swear this is only the slightest bit of exaggeration:

Rahl: You got the boy?

Nass: Yep, got the boy.

Rahl: You didn't molest him, did you?

Nass: Rahl, I *told* you I wasn't gonna molest this one! Just the ones you don't care about.

Rahl: Yeah, but what about that other time?

Nass: That was *ONE TIME*!

And then like three chapters later Rahl pours molten lead into a psychologically tortured pre-adolescent boy's mouth and then eats his balls. That, I should point out, is not an exaggeration at all.

I kept reading, though. And then. AND THEN. The *fucking* BDSM scene. Those of you who have read this book surely know what I'm talking about. Richard gets captured, out of nowhere, by a crazy BDSM lady with one of the aforementioned collars. I'd been warned that there was a 100-page BDSM scene in the book somewhere, but I didn't really take that warning at face value. Then this section started and it was, more or less exactly, that.

Not sure if it goes on for a hundred pages in truth, though. I made it to the part where a young girl (I got the impression she was about 9) starts BDSM torturing Richard and saying she'll have his love Kahlan raped, then he shatters her jaw and causes her to bite her own tongue off. I fucking stared at the page for a moment, processing what I'd just read. *A nine year old was fucked up enough to be talking about having a woman raped, and then Richard kicked her in the jaw hard enough that she bit her tongue off.* I then closed the book, walked to my computer, and typed this out - and I'm getting a sour taste in my mouth (literally, I can taste something sour) as I recall it.

Am I going to finish the book? I suppose so - I'm nearing the end, it'd be a shame to peace out now.

But oh dear lord. I had no idea. I... I didn't know.",Fantasy

1620571649.0,"Just because a fantasy story has 'dragons and wizards' in it doesn't mean all arguments for logic, realism, and consitency should be dismissed!","This is something I've seen too many times lately all over twitter, youtube, and even r/fantasy and I just want to get my thoughts out.

First of all, a fantasy story, like any story, starts with *established rules* that the audience and the author sign a pact on at the start of the journey. The rules should be clear at the start. The author can say. ""Alright, this is a fantasy story, so there will be dragons, wizards and magic and super strong giants that can swing a tree like a baseball bat. But our farmer boy main hero is a farmer boy and he is just like you and I, and he cannot swing an oak tree like a giant bat.""

As the story progresses, you can get into the shoes of the farmer boy protagonist and you know that he is just like you and I. So if the story is consistent, the farmer boy will stay that way and will solve his challenges using what you and I can realistically do if we were to thrust ourselves into this fantasy setting, this is what we mean by 'realism', and 'realism' here has nothing to do with dragons existing!

Now the story would become 'inconsistent' and 'illogical' if for example the author puts the farmer boy hero on a dragon's back, and starts to narrate thus: ""Our farmer boy hero and his mighty dragon flew from Fort Doom to Castle Evil from dawn till dusk to save his friends just in time."" WHILE before the story it was already established that Fort Doom and Castle Evil were 2,000 miles apart, and that dragons could only fly at the same speed as the fastest pigeon. Running some quick calculations, we arrive to the conclusion that this story here was **INCONSISTENT** and **ILLOGICAL**, because our farmer boy hero and his dragon only has 12 hours to cover 2,000 miles, and thus their average speed would be **167 miles per hour** on average! That is the speed of a Lamboghini in full speed, on a dragon's saddle! No average person, and in this case it was established that our farmer boy is just an average person, could survive that journey, nevermind the fact that a pigeon could only cover 500-800 miles a day on average.

(Game of Thrones season 8 is woefully guilty of these inconsistencies)

And this is what I am getting at: if you were to bring these kind of arguments into any fantasy discussion nowadays, someone somewhere would have pointed out his ultimate weapon ""This is a story with dragons and you worry about these things?!"" as if that were his trump card. Yet this 'trump card' is simply wrong! Just because a fantasy story has dragons in it doesn't mean good story telling and logical narratives should be thrown out the windows! It can be a fantasy story and it can be consistent start to finish.

This also applies to other things often mentioned here and has become controversial to mention around certain circles (think the Witcher adaptation) and so on, but that's a can of worms I probably won't open.",Fantasy

1682006932.0,"I am Brent Weeks, writer of BFF (Big Fat Fantasy novels) including the Night Angel trilogy and The Lightbringer Series, now returning after 14 years to my first love with NIGHT ANGEL NEMESIS. AMA!","Hi r/Fantasy, thanks for [inviting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/di8ox8/i_have_finally_finished_my_fivevolume_epic/) [me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/7bvs61/i_am_brent_weeks_ama_2017_version/) [back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/595vzx/i_am_epic_fantasy_author_brent_weeks_i_talk_to/). I’m Brent Weeks, the author of [The Night Angel trilogy and the Lightbringer Series](https://www.brentweeks.com/). I’m a husband to the best wife in the world and a father to two amazing daughters (ages 10 and 7), and as my Covid-era distraction now a fountain pen aficionado. I am formerly—and fervently hope that makes me forever—a winner of r/Fantasy’s Stabby Award for Best Novel. I’ve won some other plaudits too, but none of those came with cool flair, so they’re not really worth mentioning, are they?

Today, I hope to talk to you a bit about my new novel set in the Night Angel world that is coming out next week called NIGHT ANGEL NEMESIS, to talk about unveiling secret ambitions, and to dodge as few questions as possible—I’m the one who signed up for a thing called Ask Me Anything, so I do expect the usual amount of silliness and irreverence.

If you’ve never heard of Night Angel or me, you CAN read NEMESIS first. Here’s the blurb to help you see if it might be your kind of thing:

“After the war that cost him so much, Kylar Stern is broken and alone. He's determined not to kill again, but an impending amnesty will pardon the one murderer he can't let walk free. He promises himself this is the last time. One last hit to tie up the loose ends of his old, lost life.

But Kylar's best—and maybe only—friend, the High King Logan Gyre, needs him. To protect a fragile peace, Logan’s new kingdom, and the king’s twin sons, he needs Kylar to secure a powerful magical artifact that was unearthed during the war.

With rumors that a ka'kari may be found, adversaries both old and new are on the hunt. And if Kylar has learned anything, it’s that ancient magics are better left in the hands of those he can trust.

If he does the job right, he won’t need to kill at all. This isn’t an assassination—it’s a heist.

But some jobs are too hard for an easy conscience, and some enemies are so powerful the only answer lies in the shadows.”

I intend to hit your questions in shifts so that those in later time zones have a chance of me answering their questions, too: I’ll spend at least an hour here in three different blocks throughout the day, and then come back in a few days to catch as many stragglers as possible. I’ll hit the most-upvoted questions first, which I hope will save some of you time asking duplicate questions—or seeing me repeat myself with the same response. But I’ll also look for questions that seem interesting or insightful or fun for other Redditors to see me tackle.

Next week, I’ll be hitting the road for a book tour, starting at my home bookstore: the [Powells in Beaverton](https://www.powells.com/book/night-angel-nemesis-the-kylar-chronicles-1-9780316554909/2-3), then doing a new virtual signing stop with [The Signed Page](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_UQEPQNIuRzezISs6N-BmlA#/registration) as I sign many books to send worldwide, then hitting [University Books in Seattle](https://www.ubookstore.com/events?id=229&month=04&year=2023) before flying down to San Diego to visit the new-to-me location of Mysterious Galaxy. From there, I’ll head to [The Tattered Cover](https://www.tatteredcover.com/event/brent-weeks-live-aspen-grove), this time to its Littleton, Colorado branch; and my last official stop will be at [Joseph-Beth in Cincinnati, Ohio](https://www.josephbeth.com/event/brent-weeks-discussing-and-signing-night-angel-nemesis).

For those of you who love listening to your books, I’m proud to have audiobook legend Simon Vance narrating NIGHT ANGEL NEMESIS. Not only is Simon in the Audible Hall of Fame, and quite likely the narrator with more books narrated than anyone else in the business (over one thousand titles now), this year he broke his own record by being nominated for the 49th and 50th times for Audie Awards. I’ve always loved working with Simon, and he agreed to stream a conversation with me about what he has fun with and how his process works on [May 3rd at 11am Pacific](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/audio-nightangel). My editor will probably try to force me to talk, too, but Simon would be entrancing reading a database of Social Security Numbers, so I intend to mostly ask questions and listen. We also recently conned Simon into re-recording ALL of the old Night Angel books, so the character voices and all the artistic choices a narrator makes when performing will match between old books and new. We’ll be taking live questions, too. (Register for that conversation [HERE](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/audio-nightangel).)

On May 16 (at 5pm Pacific), once everyone's had some time to finish this massive tome, Orbit's trying an experiment with me doing a Spoiler Book Club for everyone who wants to talk about NEMESIS, including the ending. If that sounds like something you'd be interested in--and I think there are some chapters you'll really want to discuss--you can register [HERE](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/spoilerbc-nemesis). I'll be there. My ergonomic keyboard is getting warmed up. I’ll be back in a half an hour to start the first round!

~~(EDIT 2: It's 2:26pm PT. I'm back from my break for the next hour or two. Probably two. Know that somewhere, I'm tapping away furiously at my keyboard, trying to answer as many of these questions as I can. And feeling deeply appreciative for how kind all of you are being--even those who don't like certain decisions I've made in my work have been really gracious even while being honest. I appreciate that,~~ r/fantasy\~\~. Good job keeping this community healthy and kind.)\~\~

~~EDIT 3: It's now 6pm PT and I've been answering questions for more than 5 hours today. My brain is tired. I'm going to take a break for a couple hours to see my family, but I'll be back for just one more hour later tonight. I wanted to let you know that I WILL read all the comments, even though it's clear now that I won't have time to answer them all. I will also be back in a few days to hunt for the late upvotes or over-looked gems. Thanks all for being so welcoming. I first joined this community when there were 60k members. That you've kept awesome with 3.2 million is amazing. Be back late tonight!~~

~~EDIT 4: I came back and hit as many as I could. I have to call it for tonight. I WILL come back one last time in the next couple of days to hit as many as I can. I see that there's no way I'm going to be able to answer every question, but I CAN promise that I will at the very least~~ *~~read~~* ~~every last comment.~~

Thank you, moderators, for the opportunity to borrow your stage to say hi again, and for all the work you obviously are doing to keep this place great. And thank you, r/Fantasy for your questions, your thoughtful criticisms (really!), your kind compliments, your stories--and especially your lactose-free ice cream recommendations. I hope that many of you will grab NIGHT ANGEL NEMESIS when it comes out on Tuesday. I'd love to hear what you think of it, and I hope that you find I've grown as a writer once again, and maybe shored up some of the weaknesses you pointed out. I can't promise that you'll like it, but I promise to give my best to become a better writer with every book, and beyond that, a better human.

FINAL EDIT: I came back one last time after my book tour and hit as many as I could. If I didn't get to your question this time, well... maybe I've been good enough that the moderators will invite me again in a couple years. :) I do also do live streams and you can find me in various spots on social media. I DO also read all of my email (though replies are sparser than I wish!) that's Brent at Brent Weeks dot com. Thank you again. See you next time!

I’ve been trying to both calm down enough to write this post (you’ll see why in the next paragraph), and then not to have one of these kinds of threads for a few days so that way no one would think it was a direct rebuttal to the most recent post about an author. It seems like I'll never get the timing right, so this isn't in rebuttal to the Dresden post from a couple days ago. It's just...all of them blended together.   


The day after sending out my monthly newsletter to let my readers know my father died, I received this email:

>How writing and finishing the Tranquility Series and stop wasting time writing about your personal life and problems. I mean really we all have life problems and have to deal with crisis in our lives, but hearing about their personal problems from someone who makes a great deal of money, I'm so tired of it. How about finishing what you started, because I like to move on and finish the Tranquility series.

It wasn’t the first one I've gotten - and it's not the last one I've gotten - but that was the one that made me cry. 

We get asked a lot of times why an author doesn’t have a new book out. It can be benign: does Book Title have a release date yet? Is the preorder date on Amazon accurate? (Answer: Unless you hear it from the author, it’s not accurate).

Sometimes, we get aggressive judgement right out of the gate: why the fuck is Book Title taking so long? Why does the author need \[things\] to write? Why can’t they get off their ass and just finish the book. 

There are other times that the aggressive judgement take a while to come, like after getting their “reasons why” question answered.

>I only started this series because you said it’ll be done in early 2019. Still waiting.

All of my books are delayed about two years right now. I’d like to pretend that’s not true, but they are. I have chronic pain, which makes it difficult to concentrate. Jumping around series, and trying new projects helps when I’m unable to think through a mid-series book. 2018 was a setback year for me. I was burned out from medical appointments, physio, always being in pain, not being able to think and focus…and I only wrote one book in 2018. And, it wasn’t the book most of my readers wanted. But it was the book I needed to write to get off my shoulders, so I wrote it. My mental health is important and it was a relief finishing that book.

Then, my Dad died in December. I had to fly across the country, then I had to fly back home for medical tests that had been booked prior to Dad’s death, and then I had to fly back across the country to help move my Mom into a senior’s complex because she is disabled and she was too afraid to be alone. 

Throughout everything, I kept my mailing list up to date. Everyone who follows me online in some form knows I have had health problems. While I have kept some of the details personal, I have not been secretive about why my books keep being delayed.

And that first quote was the first reply from anyone on my ""fan"" list that I got after Dad died. Telling me to get back to work. Because my grief was not as important as someone else's entertainment.

“Yeah, but Author is a jerk to their readers.”

How much abuse should an author take before they are allowed to tell people to piss off? How much toxicity should an author have to endure from their own projects before they decide to go do something else? At what point is an author allowed to go find another project (or job) because their current clients keep sending them hate?

It is dehumanizing to be treated like nothing more than an entertainment box for someone else’s amusement. It is demoralizing to have people who call themselves your “biggest fan” to tell you they don’t give a shit you’re sick; get the fuck back to work. It’s exhausting to never be able to write fast enough. 

I have one book I don’t remember writing. But I chose to write that book while mostly bedridden because that was healthier for me than the abuse I was going to get for being late with the book. 

I was days out of surgery, fighting an infection, and was being asked on social media if the surgery meant my books would be delayed.   
I’ve posted photos of me at physiotherapy where people have told me to get back to writing. 

  
I emailed people to say my father died; and someone told me to get back to work.  


It’s not funny. It’s abuse. It's toxic. It's rude. It's mean.

1682348528.0,Posting AI Content in /r/Fantasy,"Hello, r/Fantasy. Recently we and other subs have been experiencing a sharp rise in AI-generated content. While we’re aware that this technology is new and fun to play with, it can often produce low-quality content that borders on spam. The moderator team has recently had multiple run ins with users attempting to pass off AI-generated lists as their own substantive answers to discussion posts. In a particularly bad example, one user asked for recs for novels featuring a focus on “Aristocratic politics” and another user produced a garbage list of recommendations that included books like Ender’s Game, Atlas Shrugged, and The Wizard of Oz. As anyone familiar with these books can tell you, these are in no way close to what the original user was looking for. 

We are aware that sometimes AI can be genuinely helpful and useful. Recently one user asked for help finding a book they’d read in the past that they couldn’t remember the title. Another user plugged their question into ChatGPT and got the correct answer from the AI while also disclosing in their comment that was what they were doing. It was a good and legitimate use of AI that was open about what was being done and actually did help the original user out.

However, even with these occasional good uses of AI, we think that it’s better for the overall health of the sub that AI content be limited rather strictly. We want this to be a sub for fans of speculative fiction to talk to each other about their shared interests. AI, even when used well, can disrupt that exchange and lead to more artificial intrusion into this social space. Many other Reddit subs have been experiencing this as well and we have looked to their announcements banning AI content in writing this announcement. 

The other big danger is that AI is currently great at generating incredibly confident sounding answers that are often not actually correct. This enables the astonishingly fast spread of misinformation and can deeply mislead people seeking recommendations about the nature of the book the AI recommends. While misinformation may not be as immediately bad for book recommendations as it is for [subs focused on current events like r/OutOfTheLoop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/12sc951/slight_housekeeping_new_rule_no_ai_generated/), we nevertheless share their concerns about AI being used to generate answers that users often can’t discern as accurate or not.

So, as of this post, AI generated art and AI generated text posts will not be permitted. If a user is caught attempting to pass off AI content as their own content, they will be banned. If a user in good faith uses AI and discloses that that is what they were doing, the content will be removed and they will be informed of the sub’s new stance but no further action will be taken except in the case of repeat infractions.

ETA: Some users seem to be confused by this final point and how we will determine between good faith and bad faith usages of AI. [This comment from one of our mods helps explain the various levels of AI content we've been dealing with and some of the markers that help us distinguish between spam behavior and good faith behavior](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/12xjf12/comment/jhjpex1/). The short version is that users who are transparent about what they've been doing will always be given more benefit of the doubt than users who hide the fact they're using AI, especially if they then deny using AI content after our detection tools confirm AI content is present.",Fantasy
1612204854.0,/r/Fantasy’s favorites and the Bechdel test: by the numbers,"The Bechdel test gets tossed around a lot as a metric for sexism in books/movies/tv/etc. Much of the conversation is dominated by arguing over whether or not the Bechdel test is even valid. The answer to that, I feel, is “it depends what you’re trying to figure out with it.” This post is an attempt to see how some of /r/Fantasy’s favorites fare when the Bechdel test is applied in a systematic fashion, rather than the cherry-picked way it usually is discussed.

#What is the Bechdel test?

It was first articulated by cartoonist Alison Bechdel in 1985 - [here’s the comic that originated it.](http://bechdeltestfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BechdelRule-768x432.jpg) For something to pass the Bechdel test, it must meet three criteria:

1. Feature two or more women

2. That talk to each other

3. About something other than a man

That’s it. It’s obviously not a high bar. And any feminist will tell you it’s not a great test for whether a work is actually feminist or not. Powerfully feminist works can fail it, and mysoginistic works can easily pass it. The *Twilight* movie, hardly the apex of the feminist movement, passes - there’s a scene in the beginning where Bella and her mom are talking, so it clears the bar. On the other hand, a movie like *Gravity* (starring an awesome female character) fails.

It’s not a coincidence that the Bechdel test originated with a comic. It is a joke, but a serious joke - it points to a real imbalance in how frequently and in what ways women are portrayed in media. It’s something that anti-feminists take more seriously than feminists to, or, to be a little more precise, anti-feminists *claim* that feminists take the Bechdel test much more seriously than feminists actually do. 

There are other tests one can apply, such as the Sexy Lamp test (“can this female character be replaced with the sexy lamp from *A Christmas Story* without substantially changing things?”), the Sexy Lamp with a Post-It Note Stuck On test (same as the Sexy Lamp test, to account for the circumstance where the female character provides the hero with information he needs to know, frequently occurs in James Bond movies), and the Mako Mori test (“does this feature a female character who has her own development arc, not in support of a man’s?”). But the Bechdel test is the first of these “tests” and the most widely known, so that’s what I’m going to be talking about here.

#What books am I looking at?

As I said, I wanted to be systematic about this, so I’m not choosing the books I’ll be looking at: I’m letting all of you people do it for me. Specifically, I’m looking at the top 10 books from the [2019 /r/Fantasy best novels poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/c7d7z8/the_rfantasy_2019_top_novels_poll_results/). Why 2019 specifically? Because it was the most recent list when I started this project. Because of the methodology of the polling, which goes by series/universe instead of individual novels, I’m just going to be looking at the first book in each series. (I feel a little bad that Sir Terry is going to be judged based on *The Colour of Magic*, but them’s the rules.) The specific books are:

*The Way of Kings* from the Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson

*The Hobbit* from the Middle-earth universe by JRR Tolkien (I debated whether to use *The Hobbit* or *The Fellowship of the Ring* as “book 1,” but it doesn’t actually change anything at all)

*A Game of Thrones* from the Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin

*The Eye of the World* from the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan

*The Final Empire* from Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson

*The Name of the Wind* from the Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss

*The Blade Itself* from the First Law by Joe Abercrombie

*Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* from Harry Potter by JK Rowling

*The Lies of Locke Lamora* from the Gentleman Bastards by Scott Lynch

*The Color of Magic* from Discworld by Sir Terry Pratchett

Observant readers may note that eight of the nine authors (nine not ten because Sanderson appears twice) are men, and the lone woman published with her initials because her publisher didn’t want to put out the book with the identifiably female name “Joan” on the cover. But that’s a different post.

#What’s my methodology?

I’m going to look at all these books, and see if they pass a strict reading of the Bechdel test. I will note how far into the book one has to go before the test is passed, and the circumstances by which it passes. Nothing in this post is a spoiler.

For something to qualify as a “conversation”, it needs to be between two individuals, and both need to participate. Professor McGonagall addressing the first years before the Sorting does not count, despite the presence of Hermione et al. There is a scene very early in *A Game of Thrones* where Magister Ilyrio’s serving girl tells Dany “Now you look all a princess!” which does not count because Dany does not respond. I recognize this is a judgement call on my part, but I want there to be clear lines and these seem fair. If anyone disagrees with my verdict, please let me know. And I’d be surprised if I didn’t miss something, especially in the books I don’t know as well.

And here’s where I try to turn this into something actually useful. We can’t really discuss any conclusions without something for comparison. To that end, as a control group, I will also be applying a **Reverse Bechdel test** to each of the books. To pass, the book must feature a conversation between two or more male characters that isn’t about a woman. I am applying the exact same definitions on what is or is not a “conversation.” Seems more than fair.

#Get on with it

* **The Way of Kings**. Passes the Bechdel test at the 9% mark, with the first conversation between Shallan and Jasnah. Passes the gender-reversed Bechdel test at 1%, with Kalak talking with Jezrien.

* **The Hobbit**. Fails the Bechdel test. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with Gandalf and Bilbo. (*Fellowship* also fails the Bechdel test, as does LotR as a whole, and passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1% with the Gaffer holding court at the Green Dragon.)

* **A Game of Thrones**. Passes the Bechdel test at 9%, with Arya and Septa Mordane. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with Gared and Ser Waymar Royce of the Night’s Watch.

* **The Eye of the World**. Passes the Bechdel test at 19%, with Egwene and Moiraine. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with Lews Therin and Ishamael.

* **The Final Empire.** Passes the Bechdel test at 72%, when Vin trades gossip with Lady Kliss at a ball. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with Lord Tresting and an Obligator.

* **The Name of the Wind**. Passes the Bechdel test at 70%, with the encounter between Auri and Mola. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with the crowd at the Waystone Inn.

* **The Blade Itself**. Passes the Bechdel test at 69% when Ferro encounters the Eater sister. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 2%, when Glokta interrogates Salem Rews.

* **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone**. Passes the Bechdel test at 57%, when Hermione lies to McGonagall that she decided to tackle the cave troll. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, when Uncle Vernon encounters random celebrating wizards.

* **The Lies of Locke Lamora**. Passes the Bechdel test at 51%, thanks to a few words exchanged between the mother-and-daughter alchemists d’Aubart. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1%, with the Thiefmaker and Father Chains.

* **The Color of Magic**. Fails the Bechdel test. Passes the reverse Bechdel test at 1% with the Weasel and Bravd.

#Summary

8 of the 10 books on /r/Fantasy’s 2019 top novels list passed the Bechdel test. They passed the test, on average, 45% of the way through, though with a standard deviation of a whopping 28%.

10 out of the 10 books passed the gender-reversed Bechdel test, all within the first few pages of each book.

#Commentary

For every single one of these books, the reverse Bechdel test was passed in the first few pages of the book. Determining whether or not they passed a gender reverse Bechdel test was, in every case, a formality. Finding out whether or not they passed the regular Bechdel test was much more of a challenge. And one could argue that several of these that technically pass the Bechdel test fail it in spirit: *The Final Empire,* *The Name of the Wind*, and *The Blade Itself* certainly, and probably *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* as well. (*The Lies of Locke Lamora* isn’t on this list thanks to a substantial conversation between Doñas Vorchenza and Salvara, but that one comes after the one listed above.)

So what do I conclude from this? Pretty much what I expected to, honestly. The Bechdel test itself is nigh-worthless in assessing whether or not a given book is feminst. On the basis of any book in particular, passing or failing tells us nothing.

But in aggregate, it tells us a great deal. If there were equal representation of the genders, you would expect something even with these tests applied. It’s not even close.

Brandon Sanderson has commented on this with regard to Mistborn. [The original comment is here if you want to read it](https://old.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/3yyqf5/woa_does_this_series_fail_the_bechdel_test/cyhtotr/), but the point I want to mention here is Brandon’s admission that he was so focused on making Vin a “dynamic female lead” that he didn’t act as carefully or thoughtfully with the rest of the characters, so the entire crew is male by default. And that’s the key point right there - the “default” person, whether you’re a man or a woman, is male. There are whole fields of academic study devoted to the idea of “male-as-norm,” and you can find peer-reviewed study after study from psychologists, sociologists, and many others that bear it out. If you’re going to assert that this isn’t a thing, please do your research first.

I expect this post will ruffle feathers, but please keep in mind the values of /r/Fantasy and please be kind to each other.",Fantasy

END EDIT

Well, anything within reason, that is.I'm R.A. Salvatore...Bob, and I've been writing fantasy novels for more than 35 years. I'm best known for my Legend of Drizzt novels (except on Kashyyyk, but that's another story), which have been running from the beginning of my career and are still going strong with the release this week of  ""Lolth's Warrior,"" the 39th book (along with the 5 Cleric Quintet books, the Stone of Tymora Trilogy, an anthology of collected stories, and the ""Dao of Drizzt"" - I've done a lot of work in the Forgotten Realms).

I've got a bunch of other books, including 14 (with 3 more coming) in my DemonWars world of Corona.

I've worked on video games and tabletop RPGs, as well...it's been a busy 35+ years.Ask me anything...within reason.

EDIT: Well this is kind of funny. I couldn't figure out how or why I'm posting as Maleficent... Apparently, I checked into Reddit a few months ago and was assigned a name. So for today, I'm a  witch, and if you mess with me, I'll turn you into a newt - and it won't get better.

1636261385.0,Arcane on Netflix (First 3 Episodes) Absolutely Floored Me. Has Anyone Else Watched Yet?,"I was expecting a run of the mill videogame to TV-series but I have to say judging from the first 3 episodes I am blown away. Everything from the design, the music, and the acting went above and beyond anything I expected from this show. Has anyone else watched it yet? If so, what are your thoughts?",Fantasy
1702961612.0,Picked up Fourth Wing and I feel like I've been punk'd.,"I only heard about *Fourth Wing* a few weeks ago, and upon learning about it I *also* learned that it is explosively popular and very highly reviewed. A fantasy phenomenon that I'm missing out on! The premise looked interesting enough to warrant a purchase. I'm not really into academic settings in fantasy but I loved R.F. Kuang's *Babel* so I was willing to take a chance on something that is, as every source tells me, an excellent book.

It is not an excellent book. I think it may actually be very bad? 

*Fourth Wing* is billed as adult fiction, but it feels like this was a YA novel that the writer retroactively slapped a bunch of sex and F-bombs into to make it seem more mature. The first few chapters are loaded with cliches and tropes you would expect to see from, again, a YA novel like *Eragon*. Our MC has a classic case of Anime Main Character Hair, she'd rather be reading than fighting (but she seems to be mysteriously proficient at the latter anyway), and we're told a lot of stuff up front about her past that we're kinda just supposed to accept at face value. Our hero is very smart! And now she's going to prove it by rattling off a bunch of exposition disguised as worldbuilding!

I have put the novel down and I don't expect I'll come back to it. I guess I should have done a little more digging, but I'm plagued by the feeling of having been scammed. Every source I looked at told me this book is supposed to be a breakout hit for fantasy, but it's easily the worst book I've cracked open this year.

What's going on here? Am I just missing the appeal? Do I hate fun?",Fantasy

1621860494.0,Have you ever felt like NOT starting the final book in a series you love because it will be over after this?,"This is exactly what I'm feeling with Malazan Book 10. I've been reading it from March, 2020, and it has helped me a lot going through the quarantine and stuff. It has become my favourite fantasy series during the journey. Yesterday I finished Book 9, 'Dust of Dreams' and thought, Man I can't wait to get into Book 10, 'The Crippled God', the last book of the series. It was seating on my bookshelf and I picked it up. But I just can't start it. I read two paragraphs of the book and I out it back down because it feels like this is it, the end of the epic. I'll not get to know more of these characters I so love and enjoy. The intrigue will end, the mysteries solved, the questions answered (though knowing Erikson, I'll still have a lot of unanswered questions lol), the journey will be over.
Have you guys ever felt the same about a series?",Fantasy
1683116233.0,A Wizard of Earthsea is such a beautiful book,"I finally got around to reading this classic. Honestly was expecting to find it dated and cheesy given its age and the fact that I’ve seen people say it’s YA…but what I actually found is one of the most incredible fantasy stories I’ve read in a while. Maybe ever. 

In fact, the book feels the opposite of dated - it’s written in such a way that it actually feels kind of timeless. There’s a mythical, fairy tale quality to the narrative that makes it seem like it could’ve written yesterday or a 100 years ago. Le Guin’s prose is a thing of beauty - so simple but so elegant at the same time. She can convey do much in one simple line. 

The book really filled me with a sense of melancholy, longing and nostalgia. Ged’s story of finding and fighting his own shadow feels both epic and intimate and could be interpreted in so many ways. I understood it to be a tale of a man accepting his own vulnerabilities and insecurities but I’m sure others will have their own understanding of it. 

I really can’t recommend this book enough - it truly deserves its place in the fantasy canon",Fantasy
1532380501.0,Tolkien's response to Nazis,"In 1938 JRR Tolkien was in talks with a German publisher about a German-language version of The Hobbit. Except he was asked to provide proof of his Aryan ancestry. This was his reply:


**Thank you for your letter. I regret that I am not clear as to what you intend by arisch. I am not of Aryan extraction: that is Indo-Iranian; as far as I am aware none of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects. But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject - which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.**

**Your enquiry is doubtless made in order to comply with the laws of your own country, but that this should be held to apply to the subjects of another state would be improper, even if it had (as it has not) any bearing whatsoever on the merits of my work or its sustainability for publication, of which you appear to have satisfied yourselves without reference to my Abstammung.**",Fantasy

When I asked this question yesterday, I was expecting like maybe 3-4 recommendations, but you guys came in CLUTCH and recommended almost 30 series. Quick math's tell me that's probably over 100 books (3\*30=90 at minimum).

To help myself organize them (because I plan to get through most of them eventually), I created a section with some information for each series. You can see an example below.

[My man taking a mad long time with that last book.](https://preview.redd.it/vc5up9onnf051.png?width=868&format=png&auto=webp&s=9674dfb20733c82b378ea28e1e5d1671d1b4c7d5)

I realized halfway into writing this that this might be useful to other people. So, I wrote up the entire word document, and am uploading it here for others. Feel free to use it as you like. Well, don't like hand it in as an assignment or something, but other than that you can use it. Maybe in the future I might do this again for Female Fantasy MCs and other genres, if not for anyone else then at least for myself.

Here it is. Enjoy.

Also thanks for all the series recommendations. My final pick will be either The Gentleman Bastards, The Six of Crows, The Shadow & Bones or The Ririya Revelations.

Edit: So Apparently I have quite a few mistakes in this. Unfortunate. I will be making changes to the OG Doc and reuploading it in a few hours with the fixed mistakes. My Bad. Will edit post with another edit when I do finish making changes.

Edit #2: For those asking why I don't add the authors, it's mainly cause as I said earlier this list was originally for me lol, and I don't care about the author unless I really like the series. Case in point, I don't know a single author on this list. By the time I was thinking of sharing it, I was already like 60% through and I did not feel like retroactively researching the authors again lol. I assume if you like a series enough, you'll get to know the author on your own. At least, that's how it is for me.

Edit #3: For those recommending me series now, A little too late lol. Yesterday I was free, but today I got a ton of school work to work on lol, so it's incredibly unlikely for me to add it atm. I might make a second guide at a later date though.

EDIT #4 (The Important one): I added 3 new series (Cause I took out a few since apparently they are all related and reading the synopsis of the last ones would ruin the other ones). I also made a few fixes and stuff to it. Series added were ones I forgot to add last time. No new mentions were added.",Fantasy

It is legitimately cool to be here on Reddit on publication day in the US and U.K. for *All The Seas of the World*. (Canada has its ebooks and audiobooks ready, too, actual books will be 3-7 days in arriving in bookstores. There was an April snowstorm where the printer is! Don’t ask.) But we haven’t timed an AMA this well before. Given the constraints of the last two years, it feels good to be celebrating a book launch here online with you. I’m going to hope for a return of travel and in-person events soon — and I’ll announce them when they are slotted — but for now, let’s all pour a cocktail, a whisky, a cup of tea (not in same glass, please, people) and settle in to chat.

To re-introduce myself, I’m Guy Gavriel Kay, and today sees the release of my 15th novel, because although I may not be fast, I’ve been publishing since *The Fionavar Tapestry* in the 1980s. i.e. a long time. I’m one of the lucky writers: books in over 30 languages, staying in print, and generous responses from readers around the world over all this time.

*All The Seas* has already had several starred reviews and really rewarding pre-publication attention, so I can only hope you’ll all enjoy it, too. As usual, let’s try to avoid spoiler questions (unless behind the clever Reddit blackout that hides them until clicked on) but otherwise, I’ll be back here at 8 PM EDT to type replies like a crazy person for a couple of hours.

You can start posting your questions right now, though, and check back for answers tonight, or tomorrow, or any time, because these AMAs stay up. Let’s see how we do.

OK, I'm here now, and I see there are questions. Many, many, many (very good) questions! Thank you, you terrible people. I'll answer as many I can. One note ... if it looks as if I've missed or skipped yours, check if I answered it in someone else's. There's a few, there always are, which address the same point. (Best place to start with my work, for example.) Also, please be indulgent about typos! I can't (won't) blame autocorrect, but I'll be going fast here.

&#x200B;

OK, I think that's a wrap for tonight. Questions were great, many were very funny, some were genuinely engaging 'long conversation' ones. I did my best to get to as many as I could. I appreciate all who showed up (and who will show up later, as time zones slide). Hope you had fun. Slainte.",Fantasy

1609705045.0,You can be a true fantasy fan without reading Tolkien,"I've had a couple of people tell me in the last year that to be a true fantasy fan you must have read Tolkien. However, I strongly disagree with this view, seeing it as genre gatekeeping. I'm curious what others think.

It seems that many new readers these days discover the written fantasy genre after first enjoying fantasy films and TV shows, isekai anime, graphic novels, or YA books and then start exploring fantasy novels. As such, the first fantasy novels they're likely to read are more often the Witcher series, GRRM, and similar instead of Tolkien.

I know my kids love the fantasy genre and discovered it through YA books and anime. But when they tried to read Tolkien they found his stories didn't appeal to them. I hope one day they'll go back and give Tolkien another try. But if they don't that's also okay. B/c hey, they still love the fantasy genre!

And please note I'm not disputing Tolkien's influence on the fantasy genre. Just pointing out he's not the entry point for every new fantasy reader these days.

Previous poll results from [2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/p1mwnx/the_rfantasy_2021_top_novels_poll_results/) and the [Top Lists Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/lists/)

Special thanks to the other mods for helping out majorly, especially u/kjmichaels who did so much. Thanks also to u/CoffeeArchives, u/Valkhyrie, and u/happy_book_bee. We wouldn't have this done without all that you did.

1613399094.0,"Oh Robin Hobb, what have you done?","I avoided your colossal series for so long, because so many things put me off: the medieval setting, animal companions, weird names based on virtues, the overly cliché fantasy titles, the cover art. Then one day I was in the mood for a comfort read, something familiar and easily digestible. My eyes fell on a copy of Assassin's Apprentice. I thought it might be a nice, light, palate cleanser.   


Yeah, I was an idiot.

A week later, I finished Assassin's Quest, and that bittersweet emptiness that only comes after finishing a life-changing book hit me with full force. Coming out of a state of complete and utter immersion like that left me feeling apathetic and paralyzed. Goddamn, Ms Hobb, you are good. I had almost forgotten what character development felt like, and now I can never go back. Also, Regal can just go eat a bag of toenail clippings.

I was aching to read about the rest of Fitz's adventures, but reined myself in and moved on to the Liveship Traders. I'm so glad I did. Again, I had been put off previously by the idea - sentient boats? That sounds like some weird Thomas the Tank Engine fan fiction or something. And again, Ms Hobb, you exposed me for the picky, snobbish idiot that I was. How do you take these ridiculous-sounding concepts and turn them into such rich, beautiful stories? I'm in awe. Also, Kennit can just go eat a bag of toenail clippings dipped in serpent slime. 

Then I finally got to return to Fitz. And after being away from him for three whole books, coming back felt all the sweeter. I could feel the time that had passed since the first trilogy, and it made the experience so much better. Fool's Errand destroyed me. I don't remember the last time I actually shed tears over a book, but you've gone and made me cry Ms Hobb. I hope you're happy with yourself.    


Now I'm halfway through Golden Fool, and I can't function properly in daily life anymore. I barely get any work done, because even when I stop reading my mind is still trapped in those pages. Every free moment is spent getting an extra chapter in. I'm postponing stuff just to get more time to read. My life is being controlled by a book. I haven't felt like this about a series since I was an unjaded kid, and it hurts so good.

I realize there are more then enough posts gushing over RotE, but I just needed to get these thoughts out of my system. I'm obsessed. These books are like a bowl of warm stew on a cold winter day. They somehow manage to be extremely cozy and wholesome whilst simultaneously ripping your heart out and feeding it to the dogs. You've ruined me Ms Hobb, and I can't thank you enough for it!

TL;DR: If you haven't read Hobb's work, do it. If you have, do it again.

EDIT: Wow, apparently some people thought my emotional outpouring was worth awards! That has never happened before. Thanks kind strangers!",Fantasy

I'm kind of old now (32M), but my Ma used to read **The Hobbit** to me when I was too young to read for myself. As a child, I read a lot of fantasy from **Redwall** to **The Lord of The Rings**. When the first **Harry Potter** came out, I was still in elementary and my Ma got me hooked again! I love her and I love a good fantasy story. What I love about **The Hobbit** in particular is how the heroes are just insignificant dudes who enjoy a good smoke, good food and drinks at their home but they step out of the comforts of their home and are swept away by adventure! It will always be my favorite! **Tales of Earthsea** by **Ursula K Le Guin** is great! This is all just a prelude to how disappointed I am by a lot of the modern epic fantasy. I like dark fantasy! Me and my lil bro totally vibed on Diablo 2 when I was a kid and I really dig **The Old Kingdom/Abhorsen** series by **Garth Nix**! However, rape is something I am not into. Particularly when it gets as bad as interspecies rape, gang rape, etc., which sadly has become almost normalized in fantasy.

Recently, I got to **book 9** of **The Malazan Book of the Fallen** series. Personally I feel that there some poor writing in general with this series but a few characters are written so well (**Tehol/Bugg, Kruppe**) that I kept reading. There is rape in several of the books. Given the amount of war in this series and experiencing my second major armed conflict of my life (U.S. occupying the Middle East and Russia invading Ukraine), I have come to accept rape as part of war and can bear it to some degree in the books I read by dismissing it as realism. However, there comes a point where it goes too far and fantasy regularly crosses this line. The optimist in me wants to say that the intention of the author is to describe a really graphic and repulsive rape scenario to evoke a reaction of disgust and horror. But sometimes I feel like it is used so often as a plot device that it helps normalize it. It goes so far sometimes, in the Malazan series for example, >!a woman has the front of her feet removed so that she is ""hobbled"" always presenting her backside to men and dogs in her tribe.!< **In anime/manga**, not a great example since women are frequently abused in anime/manga, >!women are raped to death by goblins or whatever!< **in Goblin Slayer and Berserk** (I would love Berserk for detailed drawings and darkness and world bulding, RIP Kentaro Muira). I also tried recently to read **The Demon Cycle** but that has >!gang rape!< too (also poorly written, there's a lot of words devoted to fighting which kind of reads like DBZ fan fiction). Can we get an appreciation/recommendation thread for all the authors that wrote engaging fantasy where women are awesome with stuff they had to overcome that wasn't being >!gang raped by a bunch of goblins?!< Personally I really like **Monstress by Marjorie Liu/Sana Takeda** comic series and **Children of Blood and Bone/Legacy of Orisha by Tomi Adeyemi**. I am sure there is so much out there! Let's hear it!! Thanks for reading!!!

Edit: I am extremely sorry if I triggered traumatic experiences for any of you. One of the things I am sort of curious about as a man who has never experienced sexual abuse is how people who have experienced this navigate through this genre where it has almost become normalized. I am very sorry if I have caused any stress for anyone my only intention was to show how extreme authors go! Also another interesting point that I considered after posting and that other commenters have replied is why does the public often react to other very personal forms of torture/abuse like slavery or forced starvation, etc. differently. I would argue that they aren't often described in as much detail or given the attention in fantasy literature but I don't like those either! I hate movies like ""Saw"" and others that have so much torture!",Fantasy

Sometimes you can just ignore it and sometimes it breaks immersion completely. 

In fantasy, the thing I notice the most is how archery is done. Characters having a conversation with their bow at full draw like it's some kind of gun, or being able to use a warbow perfectly the first time they touch it like it wouldn't require skill or strength. It's a pet peeve and it obviously depend on how heavily it impacts the plot, but at times you just wish the author would've looked it up when writing the story.

1645465814.0,Lin-Manuel Miranda no longer involved with adaptation of Patrick Rothfuss's KINGKILLER CHRONICLE series,"Actor, writer and singer-songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda [has confirmed](https://variety.com/2022/film/awards/lin-manuel-miranda-defends-not-submitting-bruno-for-oscars-teases-new-little-mermaid-songs-1235182753/) he is no longer attached to the long-gestating attempt to bring Patrick Rothfuss's **Kingkiller Chronicle** to the screen. 

Interest in the property began back in 2007, when *The Name of the Wind* was published to a rapturous reception and very high sales. It intensified in 2011, when the sequel *The Wise Man's Fear* was published.

In 2015, Rothfuss reached a wide-ranging and high-value deal with production company Lionsgate that included a feature film trilogy based directly on the novels, as well as a TV show which would act as a prequel and focus on Kvothe's parents. The following year it was confirmed that Miranda, the nuclear-hot creator of hit stage musical **Hamilton**, was working on the project as a songwriter for both the films and the TV series, whilst Lindsey Beer was working on the script for the first movie, based on *The Name of the Wind*.

In 2017, things really got moving when Showtime optioned the TV series rights, attaching John Rogers (**Leverage**, **The Librarians**) to write, produce and showrun. In 2018 Sam Raimi entered talks to direct the first film. A few months later, in 2019, John Rogers confirmed he had written all ten scripts for Season 1 of the show, which was entering pre-production. Things looked like they were going very well.

Then things collapsed, pretty quickly. In September 2019 Showtime abruptly halted all work on the **Kingkiller** TV series and returned the rights to Lionsgate. By that time it was clear that Raimi had passed on the movie project, and subsequently opted to direct *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* instead. The rumour in Hollywood was that Showtime has massively over-committed to its ambitious **Halo** TV series, spending much more than originally planned, and had to quickly divest itself of several other expensive shows, even ones that had been greenlit, in order not to have a huge budget overrun. Ironically, **Halo** was moved from Showtime to Paramount+ and the financial issues sorted out behind the scenes, meaning that possibly the **Kingkiller** project could have moved forwards after all. However, the project seemed to go cold.

In November 2020, Lin-Manuel Miranda confirmed he was still working on the IP, but the plan to adapt the (gigantic) novels as single movies had now been abandoned and the project was being reconceptualised as a TV show based directly on the novels. Miranda cited his work on the HBO/BBC co-production **His Dark Materials** (based on Philip Pullman's novels) as giving him a ""fresh perspective"" on the complexities of adapting a fantasy trilogy for the screen.

Miranda's departure from the project seems to be down to two reasons. First, his own workload is through the roof. He is currently enjoying huge success from his work on the Disney animated movie *Encanto*, including his first-ever Number One single for ""We Don't Talk About Bruno."" His 2021 film *Tick, Tick...Boom!* has also enjoyed significant critical and commercial success. Secondly, it sounds like he had not found a way of adapting the books' structure satisfyingly, noting that it has an ""insane Russian nesting doll structure,"" a reference to its multiple timelines.

An unspoken fly in the ointment is that the third novel in the trilogy, *The Doors of Stone*, remains incomplete after eleven years. Rothfuss's editor confirmed in 2020 that she had not yet read a single word of the book and did not believe any work had been done on it since 2016. Rothfuss has since spoken more openly about progress on the book, and read its prologue for the first time last year. However, no release date has been set.

Given the immense success of the series - reportedly well over 10 million and possibly closer to 20 million copies of the two books have been sold to date, easily making them the most successful debut epic fantasy series this century - it is likely an adaptation will eventually happen. However, it will not be in the near future and it will not be with Lin-Manuel Miranda's involvement.",Fantasy

I find it incredibly helpful. I don't always go straight through to book 2 when I finish book 1. Plus his stated reason is amusing. I don't notice many authors adding in exposition -- usually I'm just a little lost because maybe I forgot who is who and what they were doing.

1683317519.0,I am so tired of stories where characters don't communicate for no reason other than to create more drama in the plot,"I've seen it a thousand times, in some books/shows multiple times in one storyline. Simply telling someone something would solve EVERYTHING in 10 seconds, but NOOOOOOooooOOOOO, lets keep it inside for no apparent reason just to drag the story on so we can have a big tearful joyous ending.

Along those same lines, characters that show they can do things (like fighting back) but suddenly forget how simply because doing so would make things to easy for their side.

Basically, I HATE IT when characters do stuff/don't do stuff simply because the writer doesn't want to wrap things up yet. This is the worst trope in all of writing and it instantly kills drama/suspense for me. Just makes me want to skip to the end where they finally spill the beans or do whatever it is they need to do to end the plot line.",Fantasy

1594800818.0,The Dragon Prince (2018) is really good fantasy.,"The Dragon Prince is an animated kid’s show on Netflix that I’ve really been enjoying lately. Each episode is a tight 20-25 minutes, but they feel a lot longer with how well paced the action is. 

The plot of the show is about a war between humans and elves/magical creatures. Humans slay the Dragon King and destroy the egg of his only heir, the Dragon Prince. As retribution for this atrocity, elven assassins bind themselves to kill the human king and his heir, Prince Ezran.  One of the elves discovers that the egg of the Dragon Prince wasn’t actually destroyed and refuses to kill Ezran. Along with Ezran and his stepbrother (edit: half brother, not step brother!) Callum, the elf sets out on a journey to return the egg to its mother and end the war. 

My favorite character of the series has to be General Amaya: she’s the human princes’ aunt and a total badass in armor. I also loved Rayla, the elf who befriends the princes. I’m a sucker for characters who are conflicted about what’s right and wrong but do what they think is good anyways.

Even though this is a kid’s show, the conflict is still very nuanced and interesting. The “bad guys” are good friends of the prince and this adds another layer of intrigue to the plot. The magic system is also super cool; half the fun is just watching the animations. The art is truly gorgeous. There’s a part in the first episode that shows the Dragon King breathing lightning/thunder and it was absolutely incredible.

Watching this made me kinda sad that we won’t ever get a Wheel of Time animated series. Channeling would have been really awesome to watch in a similar art style to this show. (I’m still super excited for the live action though!) Fantasy in general lends itself well to animation.  I can totally imagine Kingkiller or the Liveship Traders as an animated series.",Fantasy

The plotting is incredibly tight and masterfully done in this dark sci-fi show, the characters are all fully realized and impeccably cast, and the music and atmosphere are just sublime.

Going into as few spoilers as possible, the series kicks off when a series of missing children cases in the small German town of Winden in 2019 starts to unravel a huge web of intrigue, lies, deceit, and secrets. There's a ton of characters but all of them matter and connect in ways you wouldn't even expect while remaining consistent until the end, all without having twist upon twist thrown at you just for the sake of twists. >!And it's legitimately the best plotted story about time travel that I've ever had the pleasure to experience, with every character across the many times cast so well that you would have sworn they were played by the exact same actors at different points in their lives.!<

The series is fully complete at 3 seasons and 26 hour long episodes, and the finale completely sticks the landing without ever buckling under the weight of its densely crafted plot. So please, if you can, give Dark a shot on Netflix. I guarantee that you will not regret it.",Fantasy

I told her Percy Jackson's Lightning Thief, and she looked at me like I'd just killed her prized cow and said ""Really? Percy Jackson? THAT'S your favorite book? I expected more from you."" Confused I asked her ""What do you mean you expected more?"" and she said ""I know you've read things like The Art of War, so I expected more from than JUST Percy Jackson as your favorite book."" I've been seeing that mentality more and more in reading groups and book clubs recently. People are outright getting attacked for being adults that enjoy young adult fiction. And I just....don't get it. Isn't the point of reading to be for enjoyment? Who cares what people read, what they enjoy or why?

&#x200B;

Do I study things like metaphysics in my free time? Yeah, yeah I do. I've read Art of War, The Prince, and many, many other tomes that people would consider too ""dense"" to be light reading or enjoyable reading. But that isn't ALL I like to read. I don't always want to have to sit and ponder the deeper meanings of words or interpret subtext. I don't want to have to be paying FULL attention at all times, otherwise I'll miss key details. Do I love Malazan? I absolutely do. Is it a headache to get through at times because of the dense, extremely detailed writing style that absolutely does not hold your hand or make it easy for you to get certain information? It certainly does.

I don't always want to feel like I'm having to fight an uphill battle to get the most out of the books I'm reading. I enjoy having adventures that are light, fun and fluffy.   And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I guess it just makes me sad because I remember growing up and being viciously bullied for being a nerd and reading things like Wheel of Time and Eragon because being a nerd wasn't ""cool"" yet unless you were into Harry Potter.

1678698738.0,"How did orcs go from Tolkien's short, bowlegged creeps with the best technology around, to tall, dim-witted hulks of muscle?","The OG orcs represented, among other things, the worst aspects of industry, and industrialized warfare in particular. So whatever their other flaws, they certainly weren't stupid or ill-equipped. But they *were* explicitly shorter than Elves and Men.

But nowadays, I feel that whenever the ""orc"" name is slapped onto a fantasy race, they are inevitably very physically strong, but often dumb and usually living in primitive, shamanistic tribes with crude weapons.

(Heck, I recently played the D&D game Solasta: Crown of the Magister, and in a cutscene where an orc stands up straight next to an elf, the elf comes up to the orc's *elbow*.)

Overall, they feel more like a stereotyped take on ""scary savages"" that threaten civilization. Which is a bit odd, since the days of civilization being under threat from barbarian tribes are long, long gone. Meanwhile, we are all familiar with the more negative aspects of industry in the modern world, ranging from pollution to immensely destructive warfare.

How did this fundamental change in what the word ""orc"" conjures up come about? It reminds me a bit of how people tend to think of Dracula as a suave charmer, and not the crude, ugly bastard from the original book.",Fantasy

1609783326.0,Homophobic Book Reviews (minor rant)," So, I just picked up the Mage Errant series because it seemed like fun, and I just finished the first book, and it was pretty fun - as well as being painfully realistic in its depiction of what it feels like to be on the recieving end of bullying, and of a character with what seems to be social anxiety disorder (that time where Hugh locks himself up in his room for days cos he's worried his friend is mad at him? Been there, done that.) Like, it's a book that genuinely gave me the warm fuzzies in a big way lol. 

 So cos I enjoyed it, I went to check out some of the reviews for the later books to see if they were as good. And lo and behold - 90% of people were complaining about a character being 'unnecessarily' gay in a later book (which I haven't read yet, so no spoilers!) 

 I just don't understand though, why people think there needs to be a 'reason' for a character to be gay. That's like me saying 'I don't understand why there's so many straight people in this book.' 

 Some people are gay. Why would it ruin a book for you, to the point of some people tanking reviews with like, 1 star because 'too much gay stuff, men aren't manly enough, grr'. It just seems pathetic. Grow up and realise that not everyone is like how you want them to be, and don't give someone a bad review because you're homophobic. 

 Okay rant over. Was just very annoyed to see this when I was looking for actually helpful reviews about what people thought of the rest of the series.

 Edit: I really appreciate all the thoughtful discussion this post has attracted, thank you!

 Also, if you find yourself typing the phrase 'I'm not homophobic BUT-' maybe take a few seconds to think really hard about what you're about to say.

1645636823.0,Burning books: Sarcastic recommendations of popular fantasy books,"Sarcastic, not serious, but grain of truth fantasy recommendations of popular fantasy books. 


The Broken Earth: recommended if you haven't been hit by a full barrage of fantasy jargon in a while and you miss that sensation. You prefer your fantasy worlds on the brink of destruction at all times.

Stormlight Archive: recommended if you think fantasy should be like science, world-building should be deep and editing your books for prose is more like a guideline than an actual rule. 

Throne of Glass: recommended if you like Cinderella, and also if you have absolutely no idea what assasins actually do. 

The Name of the Wind: recommended if you like teenage boy wishfullfillment tropes but you need something more high brow, like good prose, to tell people when they ask you why you like this book. 

The Lord of the Rings: recommended if you want an epic adventure fantasy where you don't ever have to wonder what the landscape the characters trudge through looks like because every 10 pages or so Tolkien will stop and spend at least 5 pages telling you exactly what it looked like. And then maybe a character will sing a song about it.

The Curse of Chalion: if you are tired of reading about young, eager adventurers, and would rather read about older, traumatized adventurers instead. 

Game of Thrones: recommended if you want to read fantasy that is ""real."" And by real you mean conforms to your vague and largely inaccurate ideas of what the Medieval period was like and your bleak worldview overall. 

The Sword of Shannara: recommended if you prefer your Tolkien imitators to be blatant about it. Like extremely blatant. 

Wheel of Time: if you started this in highschool and don't mind a lot of meandering. Can seem overly long at times, but what do you cut? Surely not important phrases like women crossing their arms over their breasts for the 100th time. 

Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrel: recommended if you want to read ""high brow"" fantasy but really like Harry Potter and wish magic existed. Serious bonus points if you finished the whole book with no skimming whatsoever, all 10% of you. 

Piranesi: recommended if oh thank goodness it's shorter than her last book.

Cradle: you don't have any candy in your house right now and you are looking for the book equivalent. You really enjoy video games where you level up. You like feeling, a few books into a series, that the mc is progressing too quickly and easily while simultaneously feeling like it's taking a thousand years. 

The First Law: recommended if you have a bleak outlook on life and want to read characters that share this right now. Or if morally grey/black characters = edgy and cool in your mind with bonus points for blood, the more the better. 

Malazan: recommended if you want the grittiness of grimdark, but be forced to feel deep compassion for the characters and victims of characters and the trauma they go through. In other words read if you want to feel traumatized.

A Court of Thornes and Roses: recommended if you actually just want to read smut, but with magic people. 

Spinning Silver: if you want to read a book with female characters who have agency, take charge of their lives, actually talk to each other...but are still in problematic romantic relationships. 

The Lies of Locke Lamore: recommended if you were wondering what ""witty grimdark"" would be like in a book, and really like long descriptions of things, and planning, not a lot of doing, but lots of planning to eventually do things...big things...at some point...after a few more descriptions...about what barrels look like.

The Farseer Trilogy: if you prefer your characters to be consistent, like they still make the same mistakes book after book after book. Essential reading if you think character growth is way overrated.

Books of the Raksura: if you want to read a serious book with violence and court politics as themes and characters that are bird creatures with names that sound like they could be the names of my little ponies: Flower, Chime, Pearl, Blossom etc. 

Edit: added one more

The Silmarillion: recommended if
a.) You are a fan of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings but especially recommended if you enjoy fast-paced, highly readable thrillers like Beowolf, the Epic of Gilgamesh or the ancient texts of most major religions. 
b.) You are feeling really left out of all those fights on r/ LOTR right now. You too would like to argue with people who have usernames like u /youshallnotpasschemistry on the deep lore. Round out your reading with Unfinished Tales and Nature of Middle Earth to really get em good. ",Fantasy

1575405853.0,The Dragon Prince is worth watching,"Especially if you were into Avatar back in the day.

If you haven't given it a shot, you need to. If you gave season one a shot and then said, ""meh.""... I'd suggest getting a season one recap and watching season two and three.

I'll admit, after season one, I was pretty ""meh."" I told myself I'd stick with it because I actually enjoyed having a short little show that didn't take much attention or emotion to get through. It was something to have on that's different from the other things I like to watch. The animation was pretty lame and frustrating, but I got through it.

Season two was when I really noticed the story potential. I was like, ""oh okay, we've got something here."" They fixed up the animation to where it was no longer noticable as an issue. The story began to tug at my heart strings whether I wanted it to or not. I became invested after season two, to where I immediately googled when season 3 would come out.

Season 3 is now on Netflix, and it was honestly the best animated season I've seen of anything since Avatar (I don't watch a ton of anime, so it's the best I've seen). The animation was noticable, but for how amazing it was. The colors, the action, the movements, the framing, the settings, etc.... awesome. The story was fantastic. It jumped around to different characters (kind of like game of thrones) but never felt jarring or out of sync. Plus, we finally saw some story arcs through, some plots with endings, and a few new ones start up. I'm pumped for season four.

A little research has shown me the creators have planned for seven seasons since the beginning. Which is nice to know that they're not just winging it. They have a plan and they're seeing it through. It continues to get better every season.

I'm writing this in hopes of turning more people to giving it a try. It doesn't get a ton of mentions and talked about like other Netflix shows. I don't want Netflix to decide to cut it like it did its superhero shows, before enough people find it and give it the ol college try. I want this show to do well.

1659483661.0,Historically Accurate and Miserable for the Sake of Misery: Common Arguments About and Critiques of Sexual Assault in Speculative Fiction,"*Obligatory grains of salt: this topic is a difficult and emotionally charged one. People are going to disagree with me and with each other, and that’s perfectly fine. I just ask that we all remember the person on the other end of the argument and do our best to be respectful.*

If you spend any amount of time lurking in online spaces that discuss fantasy media, you’re bound to eventually come across a heated discussion about depictions of sexual assault in fantasy. People will have wildly diverging opinions about trigger warnings; Thomas Covenant will be simultaneously described as a work of genius and the most horrible thing ever written; someone will say authors should NEVER write about \[X, Y, Z\] and someone else will reference *1984* in response to that. I’m something of a lurker myself, so I’ve seen these arguments play out many times over. I’ve thought about this topic a totally normal amount that shouldn’t be concerning at all, so today I thought I would explore some of the main points that inevitably tend to get raised during these conversations and what I think about them.

**PART 1: COMMON ARGUMENTS**

**Argument 1: SA is gross and upsetting and I don’t want to read about it in my spare time.**

**My thoughts:** okay, totally understandable. We all read for different reasons. We all have different lines in the sand for what’s too upsetting to be tolerated in what we read. We all have different lived experiences and relationships with those lived experiences. There is nothing wrong with avoiding a certain kind of content.

My only caveat is that I have sometimes seen this argument extend past *I don’t personally like it* to encompass *therefore it’s wrong to write/read about or for others to like it.* I had a conversation with the author Caitlin Sweet about this topic and I think she said it perfectly: *“personal aversion shouldn't constitute a sweeping proscription.”* For every person who reads for escapism and adventure and pure enjoyment, there’s another who reads to explore dark issues, whether for catharsis or to gain an understanding of something they haven’t experienced personally or because they see beauty and meaning in art about suffering. All of these relationships with art are possible, valid and no more right than another. There is space for all of them.

**Argument 2: books about SA are misery porn.**

**My thoughts:** they *can* be, but it’s all about execution and interpretation. I have absolutely read fiction about SA that feels exploitative and gratuitous to me. But that is not to say a) that all works featuring assault are inherently like that or b) ***that all readers feel the same way about any given work as I do.*** I think this argument assumes bad faith on the part of both readers and writers; it implies that readers would only want to read about assault because they find it titillating (see Part 2 for more thoughts about this) while writers would only want to write about it to titillate.

I’ve [spoken previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/i58tyc/thinking_about_different_kinds_of_darkness/) about the way that some books about SA are important to me because of how resonant, thought-provoking and cathartic I find works to be when they have something meaningful to say about a complex topic that I feel so passionately about - a topic that I believe *needs* to be explored because it is a massive societal issue rife with stigma, shame, apathy and misunderstanding. Again, not everyone is going to feel that way, and different people will feel different ways about the same works- that’s fine. But it only seems fair to acknowledge the existence of a diversity of relationships with this kind of fiction, purposes for writing/reading it, and subjective opinions about particular works.

**Argument 3: non-survivors shouldn’t write about it.**

**My thoughts:** I absolutely value the insight, vulnerability and courage of authors who write stories about trauma while speaking openly about being survivors themselves. I think it’s very admirable. But I also think that empathy and research exist, and some of the most powerful books I’ve read about SA are written by authors whose life experiences I know nothing about - furthermore, I do not think that their life experiences are any of my fucking business. I also think the decision to self-disclose should be totally voluntary, and in the present climate, that is definitely not always the case. Everything that I want to say about this is articulated in Krista D. Ball’s [essay](https://new.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/uk2boe/the_commodification_of_authenticity_writing_and/) *The Commodification of Authenticity: Writing and Reading Trauma in Speculative Fiction* and the resulting thread, so if you want to see this explored in-depth, I suggest you check that out.

In short, though, here is what I think: those who think they’re taking a bold stand for trauma survivors by demanding that strangers disclose their painful personal experiences to a public that is ready to rip them to shreds for one perceived misstep in their fictional representations (sometimes to the point of harassing them into disclosure) have an extremely dubious understanding of trauma advocacy and are doing something pretty harmful with no actual beneficial results. As I said in one of my responses to Krista’s essay, what do you mean, one of the prevailing tenets of rape culture (if you are unfamiliar with the term or want to read an excellent article exploring the scope of the issue, [here you go](https://www.vox.com/2014/12/15/7371737/rape-culture-definition)) is not believing survivors while simultaneously demanding that they repeatedly share the details of what happened to them with complete strangers? When \*I\* do it, it's actually very smart and brave and progressive of me and definitely not for Twitter clout!

**Argument 4: but it’s historically accurate!**

**My thoughts:** YES I am talking about Game of Thrones for this one because it is the poster child of this argument. A number of people associated with the show and books, including George R.R. Martin, have explained that the world’s brutality towards women is meant to reflect on “the way it was” in the medieval time period the books are based on. A few thoughts about this one:

* I kept adding and deleting bits about the debates around whether Game of Thrones is Actually Historically Accurate and some of the potential repercussions of emphasizing that widespread sexual violence is a feature of the past dichotomized from the present, but I think they bogged things down a bit - if anyone is interested in exploring that more, let me know.
* My main point is that this argument can feel a little silly to me as a justification ***on its own*** because fantasy is inherently transformative, isn’t it? Authors deliberately choose to take inspiration from some aspects of the real world (past and present) and forego others. The process of creating fantasy fiction is inherently one of stitching together the real and the imaginary. The notion that authors are somehow obligated to replicate all aspects of a source of inspiration indiscriminately just does not ring true when there are dragons and face-changing assassins etc. etc. I’ll quote medieval historian David Perry (full interview [here](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/15/missing-the-target/)):
* *“These are all things that tell us a lot more about ourselves than about the Middle Ages…we pick and choose, the creators pick and choose, they want to show something that will be disturbing or controversial or will be a political tool and they try to say history supports us in this. And then they throw in dragons and zombies and then they say that’s unrealistic but that’s okay, that’s just storytelling.That comes back to what I try to say–it’s okay to draw from history, but history does not wholeheartedly support any one of these fictional depictions. These come from creators making choices. And the choices they make have consequences.”*
* A great example of that “picking and choosing” he mentions is that stories justifying their inclusion of SA because they’re set in wartime and SA is a tool of war rarely, if ever, feature male survivors of SA even though SA as a tool of war absolutely has targeted and continues to target people of all genders. It’s worth exploring why this authorial choice gets made so often. I also think [Daniel Abraham](https://aidanmoher.com/blog/2012/04/articles/concerning-historical-authenticity-in-fantasy-or-truth-forgives-you-nothing-by-daniel-abraham/) wrote very articulately on the overall issue of historical accuracy and authorial choice.
* That being said, I do believe it is possible to write about sexual violence as a way of exploring our own world’s past and how its legacy continues on today. My thought process for writing about marital rape in a fantasy world inspired by the Victorian era, the time of legal coverture, was to explore the mindset of someone experiencing and working through assault that isn’t necessarily identified as such by the world around her; in my work as a sexual assault advocate, many of my clients who are abused by their partners do not feel that their abuse “counts” the way that stranger-perpetrated assault does due to how we have dealt with and defined SA for a very long time. But I think that in order to make the claim that the incorporation of brutality against women is some kind of purposeful statement about history or the present day, you actually have to have a statement or purpose for your inclusion…and in many of the instances where I see the argument about historical accuracy rearing its head, I don’t necessarily know if that’s happening (again, this is with the caveat that different people find different meaning in given works). Otherwise it can fall into the territory of feeling trivializing.

**Argument 5 (opposite of Argument 4): fantasy stories shouldn’t be burdened by the ways that the real world sucks.**

**My thoughts:** this argument is epitomized by Sara Gailey’s essay “[Do Better: Sexual Violence in SFF](https://www.tor.com/2016/08/22/do-better-sexual-violence-in-sff/).” Their argument is essentially that the ubiquitous inclusion of sexual violence against women in SFF is a problem because it implies that rape and rape culture are societal inevitabilities, that authors who write about sexual violence against women don’t know how to write about women *without* writing about sexual violence, and since the point of speculative fiction is to speculate, authors should aim to speculate about worlds free from sexual violence.

For the record, I do think it’s totally possible that some authors might not know what to do with their female characters and throw in half-assed assault plotlines as cheap character development, and I do think that’s worthy of criticism - in fact, I’ll talk about it later. I also think that one of the most powerful things about speculative fiction is that it can show us alternatives to our own world. As I mentioned while talking about Argument 1, sometimes you just want a reading experience where you don’t have to think about the fact that people like you are oppressed and often hurt in the real world. And sometimes speculative stories free from oppression can help open our minds and allow us to see how things could be different in reality.

But I think there are elements of overgeneralization and assumptions of bad faith at play here. While I said that I could see some authors only writing SA plots because they don’t know how to write fully-fledged female characters, I think it’s disingenuous to say that Robin McKinley was doing that with *Deerskin* or that Ursula Le Guin was doing that with *Tehanu* (oh God, Charlotte’s talking about *Tehanu* again) or that any author who has taken the time to write meaningfully about sexual assault has only done so because their imagination wasn’t strong enough to imagine a world without rape, something Gailey states about such authors in their essay.

Back to Argument 1: sometimes you want escapism, but sometimes you don’t. Sometimes you want to see common human struggles and painful experiences reflected and explored in your literature, and I don’t believe that there is any reason for speculative literature to be an exception to that just because it is speculative. Stories that reflect on trauma can be just as important as stories that forego its inclusion, and both sides of the coin are valid. As a final note, I asked Gailey about this essay in a recent r/fantasy AMA of theirs, and I really appreciate their response, which you can read [here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/lnmkqk/comment/go1t5g7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

To summarize my thoughts about Arguments 4 and 5, I don’t think that “it needs to be based on the real world’s past” or “it’s SFF so it shouldn’t resemble the real world” are valid arguments for including or excluding sexual violence from stories on their own. I think it all depends on the purpose of the story and what you do/don’t do with the sexual violence in your story.

**Argument 6: it’s problematic to write about topics that could be triggering for some readers.**

My thoughts about this can be summarized by something that YouTuber Sarah Z says in her video essay “[Fandom’s Biggest Controversy: The Story of Proshippers vs Antis](https://www.google.com/search?q=sarah+z+shipping+wars&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS980US980&oq=sarah+z+shipping+wars&aqs=chrome.0.69i59.7769j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8):”

*“There are a lot of people talking about it as an accessibility issue. The idea is that, by virtue of the game \[Boyfriend Dungeon\] including elements of stalking at all, even with a warning, not everyone would be able to play because some people might have trauma surrounding it, and it’s therefore unethical for the game, in its current state, to exist. The natural implication, then, is that anything short of restricting the kinds of stories that can be told is not only insufficient but actively hostile to people with trauma. To counter this, we might be tempted to point out that some creators tell and share these kinds of stories to cope with their own trauma, and art can be a vital tool for exploring trauma, and it’s equally restrictive to discourage them from telling their own stories, but honestly we don’t have to. An author’s personal experiences here are none of our business. It doesn’t matter, because, fundamentally, this way of viewing art that sees upsetting content as an accessibility issue is untenable. The breadth of things that might trigger or upset a person is essentially infinite. The human experience is diverse and a piece of media that everyone on earth will find appropriate to consume doesn’t exist.”*

For an essay about the first hypothetical rebuttal Sarah mentioned and its relationship to disabled and queer communities, check out Ada Hoffman’s “[Dark Art as an Access Need](https://adahoffmann.substack.com/p/dark-art-as-an-access-need).”

**Argument 7: but why do people get so upset about representations of SA when fantasy writers also write poorly about war/torture/murder and no one complains about that?**

**My thoughts:** every time there is a post on r/fantasy critiquing the writing of SA in spec fic, a post saying something along these lines seems to follow. I have a few thoughts about this:

* Critiques of non-intimate violence (war, murder, torture etc. as opposed to SA or abuse) in speculative media, especially their glorification and use for shock value without any realistic psychological impacts, absolutely do, and should, exist.
* The notion that both “types” of violence, intimate and non-intimate, can be criticized is not negated by the existence of critiques focused on just one or the other.
* You might see more discussion focused on intimate violence for a few reasons that I can think of:

1. The emotional relevance of the issue to the average fantasy reader’s life. Vastly more readers of English fantasy literature are going to be directly impacted by this kind of violence than they are going to be impacted by experiences of war, murder or torture.
2. The way that issues of intimate violence are so deeply impacted by broader societal attitudes and prejudices that are, in turn, upsetting to read when depicted uncritically in (and potentially impacted by, depending on what you believe) media. Rape culture is something that I see at its worst every day in my job - I cannot overstate how drastically it changes survivors’ experiences and outcomes in every conceivable way. I don’t think you can make the argument that there is an equivalent “torture culture” or “murder culture.”

**PART 2: COMMON CRITIQUES**

**Critique 1: lots of backdrop SA for the sake of making the world gritty and shocking**

**My thoughts:** the use of lots of backdrop SA is often closely tied to the argument that a world needs to be “historically accurate.” It can feel exploitative and trivializing when authors throw around lots of random references to brutalized women just to set the tone of the world/story, especially when that story doesn’t really think about those women’s experiences or the complexities of sexual violence as it relates to societal mores at all. Survivors’ experiences, needs and voices are already frequently dismissed and silenced in the real world, which is set against them in many ways. With that in mind, sometimes when you hear all these casual references to SA randomly mentioned - making it clear that assault is a big part of the world - but the topic is never really addressed, it can feel like it plays into that dismissal or is at least unpleasantly reminiscent of it. I use the word “exploitative” because, with the dismissal of survivors’ experiences and the distortions of rape culture still in mind, authors who use this approach treat painful, complex, stigmatized lived experiences as nothing more than aesthetic for a story. I don’t necessarily mean that every story that so much as mentions SA needs to have it at the absolute forefront of the story, but I do think that it is worthwhile to consider its purpose and framing before it is included as a background reference.

**Critique 2:** [**Fridging**](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge)**/ the assault of women to spur male character development**

**My thoughts:** “But there are lots of real-world examples of men being motivated to \[do X, Y, Z\] because of violence against women!”

Sure, but the underlying attitude behind that historical motivation and its frequent framing in fiction is that a woman’s SA/abuse/death/etc should be focused on *only to the extent that it impacts a man.* The focus here is the man’s honor and pain and consequent actions, not the actual female survivor’s experiences. As I have said, survivors’ suffering is often dismissed and minimized in the real world. We are more than objects to be fought over and our pain is more than a man’s inciting incident in his Hero’s Journey; when those attitudes are reiterated without thought in fiction, it can get tiresome.

**Critique 3: The sexualization/romanticization of SA perpetrators/scenes of assault**

**My thoughts:** Ok, this is where my hot takes get the hottest.

* **Hot take 1:** everything I said about Argument 2 applies here: different people will feel different ways about the same works, but those who wield this critique without discernment about all works featuring SA are just plain wrong in my opinion.
* **Hot take 2:** I always see the argument about SA existing in fiction for the sake of titillation mentioned in the context of male authors and readers. That ignores the existence of a long, long history of romance/erotica featuring “noncon” intended for a female audience. In the past we had bodice rippers - there is a fascinating history behind them and their relationship to historical notions of consent (or the lack thereof) and proscriptions against women’s sexual pleasure. To read more about that, a good starting place is [here.](https://bookriot.com/the-history-of-consent-in-romance/) Now there’s a booming market for Dark Romance™ and specific niches like Omegaverse. For the sake of fairness, I think that needs to be mentioned.
* **Hot take 3:** there is a wide variety of opinions regarding fiction impacting reality, and the arguments always seem to come to a head when it comes to this particular area of criticism. On one hand, there is the argument that the romanticization/sexualization of SA in fiction goes on to detrimentally impact the way that readers think about these issues in reality whether they realize it or not; on the other hand, there are those who argue that they are fully capable of differentiating one from the other and fiction is a safe place to explore fantasies that we would not actually want to be involved in in real life. My wishy-washy personal opinion is that both can absolutely be true depending on the individual person, the works involved and a variety of other factors - they are not necessarily 100% mutually exclusive statements. I will also say that I think there is a vast difference between the following:
   * A series like *A Court of Thorns and Roses* by Sarah J Maas, which is frequently categorized and marketed as young adult. In it, the male romantic lead is framed as an ideal feminist lover whose abuse is not identified as such in text and is justified by excuses, many of which are commonly used by real life abusers, that are fully endorsed as valid and romantic by the narrative.
   * A dark romance categorized for adults that is clearly labeled as a dark romance everywhere that it is sold.

**Critique 4: SA that is used by the narrative for cheap female character development, specifically to “teach her a lesson” or make her stronger**

**My thoughts:** this is to be clearly differentiated from stories that meaningfully depict the aftermath of trauma and/or healing. I’m talking about the instances of kickass Strong Woman butterflies emerging from traumatic chrysalises with no meaningful journey involved. Part of what is so devastating about sexual assault is that it is about choice and control over essential, fundamental things being taken away. This trope feels so cheap, trivializing and disrespectful because it glosses right over the impact of that disempowerment and veers into the territory of the [“lemonade from lemons”](https://www.michigandaily.com/michigan-in-color/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-lemonade/) platitudes that I guarantee most survivors have heard from at least one, if not more, very well-meaning person. To this section I will also add that there is a great deal of emphasis on survivors being “perfect” victims who respond in tidy ways that are not messy or challenging, while in reality trauma responses can be incredibly varied. I think that this trope could be born of this expectation, and that this expectation accounts for readers’ often-hostile reactions to fictional trauma survivors who cope in ways that defy that tidy, expected narrative.

**CONCLUDING THOUGHTS**

Readers are not a monolith. Authors are not a monolith. Survivors are not a monolith. I hope for a SFF community where we can understand that different readers read for different reasons, and that all of those reasons can coexist. Similarly, I hope we can understand that different readers are going to have different relationships with the same works. I hope we can take a step back from immediate assumptions of bad faith about those who choose to feature SA in their reading and writing, and at the same time, I hope that those who avoid it altogether do not get lambasted for that choice. Both choices have validity. I hope that we can analyze what we read and create with a mindfulness of the tropes and approaches that evoke, replicate or feed into the overwhelming stigma, misunderstanding and disrespect survivors face in the real world.

A few community-specific notes: readers looking for particular recommendations avoiding SA or dealing with it in particular ways (no on-page assault scene, no victim-blaming, no perpetrator POV) should not have to face backlash for their requests and then have to consequently justify them by divulging their personal trauma histories to random querulous Redditors. This is one of the main reasons that the [Sexual Violence in SFF](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQi6C2RQvjGzjSoXU0D063fCFcz1wCHXFUe7PfEsGrk/edit#gid=0) database exists. I think it’s an excellent resource, and I encourage everyone [to contribute if they can. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/a3dyez/sexual_violence_in_sff_database_20_update/)

Finally, I’ve made something of a project of reading SFF that explores trauma, and I thought I would conclude by describing a few of the works that I have appreciated the most featuring sexual assault. There are a few of these books that feature often-difficult topics in addition to SA or elements that might be difficult for some readers, so I included notes about those in spoilers.

* *Damsel* by Elana K Arnold - explores the gendered power dynamics of fairy tale tropes by mashing them together in a unique story about a girl who is rescued from a dragon by a prince.

1658573050.0,The first AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER animated movie will be a sequel focusing on Team Aang,"[It's been confirmed](https://ew.com/events/comic-con/first-avatar-the-last-airbender-animated-movie-will-focus-on-aang-comic-con-2022/) that the first new Nickelodeon **Avatar: The Last Airbender** project will focus on the original cast and will be set after the original show. The news was revealed at the San Diego Comic-Con. 

Original **Avatar** creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko have teamed up with Nickelodeon to create new animated projects in the same universe. Three animated movies have so far been greenlit, with at least the first set for a theatrical release. The first movie will be directed by Lauren Montgomery (**Voltron: Legendary Defender**, **The Legend of Korra**). DiMartino and Konietzko will write, with OG **Avatar** writer Eric Coleman also on board. Further projects, including a new ongoing animated series, are also under discussion.

It's assumed that the original voice cast will return. The precise storyline for the sequel is unknown, but DiMartino and Konietzko previously authorised a series of graphic novels dealing with subjects like the search for Zuko's mother and political tensions between the Earth Kingdom and the Fire Kingdom colonies cut out of its territory a hundred years earlier, eventually leading to the founding of Republic City. These graphic novels could provide a storyboard for new projects, or the writers may choose to tackle unrelated subjects.

These projects are unrelated to the live-action remake of the original animated series being worked on at Netflix. The first season of that project wrapped production last month and will debut on Netflix in 2023.",Fantasy

Thanks much for a good time, everybody. I just went through and answered a bunch of questions I didn't get to last night, and read more of the responses. But now I've got to get back to my regular life. 

That said, It's been a while since I've done one of these free-for-all Q&A's, and I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed them. I'm not on reddit much. But I think I'm going to do a few more Q&A sessions over on Facebook and Twitter, where I'm a little more active.

Heya everybody, I'm Patrick Rothfuss.

I'm a fantasy author.

I'm a father. I have a four-year-old and a one month old. Both boys.

In addition to being an internationally bestselling Fantasy author, I run a charity called Worldbuilders. (www.worldbuilders.org) Over the last five years we've raised over 2 million dollars for Heifer International.

Here are some guidelines based off the Machine Gun Q&A sessions I run [on my blog.](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/category/machine-gun-qa/)

  1.  You can ask any question.

  2.  Bite-sized questions are best. I'd rather answer a bunch of smaller, more entertaining questions rather than spend all my time laboriously typing up 3-4 long, detailed answers and having to ignore everyone else as a result.

  3.  One question per comment is best. It's just simpler and easier that way.

  4.  I reserve the right to lie, make jokes, or ignore your question.

       4b. If I ignore your question, it’s not because I hate you. It’s probably just because I don’t have anything witty to say on the subject.

  5.  I reserve the right to be honest, snarky, or flippant. Either consecutively or concurrently.

  6.  I won’t answer spoiler-ish questions about the books.

I will be back at 8 pm Central to answer questions.

I've just read the latest Brandon Sanderson (Rhythms of War) and finished up Brent Weeks' Lightbringer pentalogy and was recommended to read the Witcher books or the 'Wheel of Time'. I've been looking in bookstores and all the new ones have these irremovable 'stickers' on them saying 'Now available on Netflix' or 'Now streaming on Amazon Prime'. I made the mistake of buying a copy of 'Good Omens', thinking the sticker could be removed and was annoyed to find that it wasn't a sticker at all, but printed onto the actual cover art.

1663860916.0,Amazon confirms changes to its ebook return system,"Despite the latest TikTok trend, serial returning of fully-read Kindle ebooks has been a long issue. In theory, Amazon says they allow returns up to 14 days for any ebook, including fully read, but in reality they have allowed returns up to one year (Source: Literally me. My royalty statements over a decade of publishing). If a person had a lower sales series, it was really easy to see trends such as:

1. Buy Book 1. Return 1 day later.
2. Buy Book 2. Return 1 day later.
3. Buy Book 3. Return 2 days later.
4. Buy Book 4. Return 2 days later.
5. Buy Book 5. Return 1 day later.

This has always been a specifically Amazon problem, as they allowed these kinds of returns. With pressure from American author associations, Amazon has finally said they will make improvements to this system.

For me, the biggest improvement is this:

>Most notably, we will de-activate self-service returns for any book read past 10%, adding substantial friction to the process.

People will still take advantage of the system, because people are people. However, this will slow things down and add an easier-to-follow paper trail within the Amazon system.

We would each read the other's favorite series so that we could discuss and share about them. This means I'm reading A Court of Thorns and Roses and she's reading Mistborn. 

Since we've done this and have been discussing it with others, there have been tons of ""those books are for women"" type comments towards me. My wife's mother even said ""you're going to turn him into a girl"" to her (side note, the hilarity of that statement is still amusing both of us) and that she shouldn't be ""making me"" read a ""girl's book"". 

While I don't think I'm really the target audience for ACOTAR, I still think it's a good story with some cool elements and I've stayed up way too late reading them a few nights. I also like being able to enjoy something that my wife loves so much. I just find it so funny and a bit strange that people are so quick to judge that I'm reading them.

1705854191.0,How to recommend books when someone requests no sexual assault,"I've been on this sub for a while, and one thing I've noticed is that people tend to struggle giving recommendations when the OP clearly specifies that they don't want to read books with sexual assault or rape in them. I've decided to make a post about some things I think would help people when making recommendations. Starting with the obvious:

# Read all of and respect the any request that asks people to avoid recommending books with sexual assault

**Read the entire recommendation request.** Often times there's something else the original posts request is asking for and a disclaimer line at the bottom that specifies no sexual assault. People frequently don't see the disclaimer or only read the title. If you can read all 1,746,560 words in A Song of Ice and Fire or all 3,325,000 words in Malazan Book of the Fallen, you can read an entire reddit post. Please do so.

No matter how well a book fits the other parts of the request, **if it contains graphic on screen sexual assault,** **do not recommend it**. I don't care how much you like A Song of Ice and Fire, The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, The Sword of Truth, Malazan Book of the Fallen, or any other series that obviously contains graphic sexual assault. I don't care how well written you think they are. I don't care how well you think it's handled. They should not be recommended on these posts.

I know this seems obvious, but I've seen people recommend all of the series I've listed. Seriously, somewhere between 8-10 people were recommending Malazan on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/194mksc/what_is_a_staple_fantasy_you_think_everyone/) that specifies no sexual assault. On the same day, one of the top comments on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1946cay/what_is_the_most_evil_act_youve_ever_encountered/) about ""the most evil acts in fantasy fiction"" was being populated with examples of extremely graphic scenes of sexual assault and rape in Malazan. I know it's not the majority of people doing this (most of you will find the rest of this essay more nuanced and helpful, hopefully), but there's enough out there that I feel like it should be called out.

# How to tell if a book contains sexual assault

**If you aren't sure/don't remember if a book contains sexual assault or not, try to double check**. [The Sexual Violence in SFF Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hQi6C2RQvjGzjSoXU0D063fCFcz1wCHXFUe7PfEsGrk/edit#gid=0) is a great resource. In addition, [StoryGraph](https://thestorygraph.com/) has user generated lists of content warnings. Look for tags for sexual assault, sexual violence, and rape after clicking on Content Warnings: See All on the page for a book. Neither of these resources is perfect, so if you are really unsure or know that you have a hard time remembering details like whether or not a book contains sexual assault, **it's probably best to not recommend anything**. You can also specify what aspects you are sure about (ie, ""I know there's no graphic scenes of rape in this one"") and what you are not sure about (""There might have been sexual assault as part of a character's backstory, I don't remember"").

Sometimes, there's a bit of confusion about what counts as sexual assault. [The definition of sexual assault from RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/articles/sexual-assault) is:

>sexual contact or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the victim. Some forms of sexual assault include: Attempted rape, Fondling or unwanted sexual touching, Forcing a victim to perform sexual acts, such as oral sex or penetrating the perpetrator’s body, \[and\] Penetration of the victim’s body, also known as rape

Keep in mind that consent is about more than not saying no and coerced sex is still rape. Once again [RAINN's definition can help clarify](https://www.rainn.org/articles/what-is-consent):

>Consent cannot be given by individuals who are underage, intoxicated or incapacitated by drugs or alcohol, or asleep or unconscious. If someone agrees to an activity under pressure of intimidation or threat, that isn’t considered consent because it was not given freely. Unequal power dynamics, such as engaging in sexual activity with an employee or student, also mean that consent cannot be freely given.

I often see people struggling to recognize sexual assault in fictional settings because it does not look like how we typically think of sexual assault in the real world. **It's still sexual assault.** To give an example, >!Orogenes being forced/coerced to have sex with one another for reproductive purposes!< in The Fifth Season is not consensual and should be considered rape. Other times, it's because the book itself does not clearly/explicitly recognize what happened as sexual assault or because our society still has blind spots for what we consider sexual assault to be. For example, a number of people have interpreted when >!Tylin rapes Mat!< in A Crown Of Swords (The Wheel of Time) as a humorous interlude and not rape. I've found this to be an issue especially in the case of male victims of sexual assault, and I want to point anyone who wants to learn more to Pop Culture Detective's videos about it in other forms of media ([part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc6QxD2_yQw), [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nheskbsU5g)). If anyone wants to give more examples in the comments of scenes of sexual assault or rape that are not always recognized as such by readers, I would appreciate additional examples being given in the comments.

# But this book doesn't contain graphic on-screen sexual assault, so that must mean it's ok, right?

Often, we don't know where the OP's exact boundaries are for how explicit the sexual assault must be. Some people are ok with sexual assault as long as it's not on screen. Others don't want it mentioned at all. Obviously, read the original request carefully to see which one the OP seems to want. **It's best to error on the safe side.** If it's not specified, but if sexual assault

* is part of the world building
* is threatened
* is a theme in the book
* is relevant to a character's motivation in the book
* is part of a character's backstory
* has happened off screen/is implied to have happened
* might have occurred, with some level of ambiguity (including questionable consent)
* is used to provide imagery to express how terrible a fantastical/violent event in a book is (ie. used metaphorically)
* is joked about
* is relevant/threatened as a part of forced marriages
* is mentioned repeatedly
* etc

**either recommend a different book or add a disclaimer for context**. Obviously, part of this is also a judgement call. If rape is a major part of the worldbuilding for a book or is a major part of a character's backstory, it's probably best to recommend a different book. If it very briefly crosses a female character's mind that she might be in danger of being sexually assaulted but nothing happens with it, in my opinion, a disclaimer should be enough.

To give an example of what I mean that comes up constantly, Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson has no graphic on-screen scenes of sexual assault in it, but rape and sexual assault are a major part of the world building (ie. >!the rape and murder of Skaa women and girls!<), which is immediately obvious from just reading the first couple pages of the book and is brought up repeatedly throughout the series. Again, commenters should either add a disclaimer or (ideally, in my opinion) recommend a different book. For example, someone could recommend Tress of the Emerald Sea over Mistborn if you still wanted to recommend a Sanderson book.

On the other hand, consensual explicit sex scenes are fine unless otherwise specified, and no additional disclaimers are needed. I've seen a couple people give disclaimers for these, and I think it's important to remember it's not the presence of explicit scenes that people want to avoid, it's the nature of them. Just because a book contains sex and/or violence does not make it contain sexual violence. I think it's important to add disclaimers for scenes with dubious consent though, and scenes of particularly violent sex should probably be given a disclaimer even if it's consensual. Also, you should probably give disclaimers for things that don't meet the exact definition of sexual assault but are related to it (genital mutilation, sexual harassment, abusive relationships, stuff like that).

**Please respect that some people don't want to deal with the extremely sensitive real world issue of rape or sexual assault at any level in their escapist fantasy books.** If you are afraid of giving a disclaimer because of spoilers, well, that's what spoiler tags are for. Having information and context is always helpful. **Give people the choice on whether or not they want to risk being spoiled or risk being traumatized.**

Although having a disclaimer for additional context can be very helpful, please also respect that when all the top comments have disclaimers of ""it might not contain a graphic rape scene but..."" in them, it can be disheartening. **Please make an effort to upvote and/or recommend books that don't contain sexual assault at all.** In addition, if you see a book recommended that needs a disclaimer or straight up does contain sexual assault, **please comment with a correction**. If a correction gets added to your own recommendation, please take that graciously. I think we all understand that mistakes will happen on these posts and people forget about details around sexual assault in a book all the time, which isn't a moral failing. Just keep it in mind for next time.

Additional examples of books containing things on my bulleted list and how/when to provide disclaimers would be appreciated in the comments. In addition, if anyone disagrees about part of this essay or wants to discuss a part further, I would be happy to talk about it in the comments. I'm not the sole authority on how to give recommendations on these sorts of posts, this is just some advice I think people will find helpful based on what I've seen people do in the past.

# Other Comments

It's best to keep the conversation focused on giving recommendations. Comments about sexual assault being frequent or infrequent in fantasy are generally not very helpful, especially when they are not paired with any recommendations. Especially do not comment about if the OP's request to avoid sexual assault should be allowed or if it is an ok thing to ask. Please also don't get side tracked into discussions about whether sexual violence or regular physical violence is worse. The OP asked to avoid one and not the other, and it's not your place to question why.

Also, just to clarify, my own post is about giving correct recommendations to someone who does not want to read about sexual assault. It is not about how common sexual assault is or isn't in fantasy. It is also not about whether or not sexual assault should be included in fantasy books, etc. Personally, I'd prefer if the discussion in the comments stayed focused on how to give correct/accurate recommendations.

Finally, I want to give a shout out to all the good people who spend the time to make sure their recommendations are accurate and the ones that comb through the comments in posts requesting no sexual assault, adding disclaimers or saying that a book actually does contain sexual assault. You know who you are, and I think you're awesome.

1596982560.0,Why J.R.R. Tolkien Never Won a Hugo Award,"The Hugo Awards are the premier awards for science fiction and fantasy literature, first given out in 1953 and every year since 1955. One of the more interesting mysteries of the award is that J.R.R. Tolkien, widely regarded as the most prominent fantasy author of the 20th Century, was never given one despite being eligible on multiple occasions.

*The Lord of the Rings*, Tolkien's best-known work, was originally published in three volumes despite being written as a single novel: *The Fellowship of the Ring* and *The Two Towers* were published in 1954 and *The Return of the King* in 1955. This made the individual books eligible for the 1955 and 1956 Hugo Awards, and the novel as a whole also eligible in 1956. Similarly, *The Silmarillion*, published in 1977, should have been eligible in the 1978 Hugo Awards. Later Tolkien works, consisting of off-cuts from his notes and repackaged material previously published, would have been more controversial but likely could have made eligibility in other categories (particularly *Unfinished Tales*, effectively a short story collection, published in 1980).

*The Lord of the Rings*' failure to qualify is perhaps unfathomable to modern readers given its titanic impact on genre history, but more understandable when given context. When the book was originally published, it attracted strong reviews from the likes of W.H. Auden and C.S. Lewis, but opprobrium from a lot of mainstream critics. Although *The Hobbit* (1937) had already become a well-regarded classic of children's literature, its sequel initially was deemed too long, too weird and too unclear in its audience. There was also a modest delay between the UK and US publication, and the book was only available for more than a decade in hardcover, putting it out of the price and reach of many readers.

*The Lord of the Rings* also had two other things going for it: although the Hugos did not ban or omit fantasy, it was generally seen as a science fiction award first and foremost; an outright fantasy novel did not win the award for the first time until 2001, when *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* took the top prize. Once that happened the floodgates opened and more followed (*American Gods*, *Paladin of Souls*, *Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell*, *The Graveyard Book* and all three volumes of **The Broken Earth** trilogy), but for much of its history, the award has not regarded fantasy in a good light. Secondly, Tolkien was British, and the Hugos were seen as a predominantly American award. To win a Hugo Award, British authors had to have their work published by prominent US genre publishers or become so dominant in the field that they couldn't really be ignored (as with Arthur C. Clarke). This cross-Atlantic ignorance also went both ways, with the Hugos having almost zero profile in the UK. The first Brian Aldiss knew that he'd won the 1962 Hugo Award for Best Short Story (for his *Hothouse* collection of interlinked stories) was when the award showed up at his house in the post. The first issue probably penalised Tolkien, although the latter did not, as his books were distributed by a reasonably big US publisher within a year of their UK release.

Although certainly not obscure on release, it was not immediately regarded as a classic and the American WorldCon attendees (the two ceremonies were held in Cleveland, Ohio and New York City, respectively) seem to have pretty much ignored it. The 1955 Best Hugo was instead given to Mark Clifton and Frank Riley's *They'd Rather Be Right* (later [regarded by some](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/jan/29/aliteraryargumentagainstde) as the ""worst book ever to win the Hugo Award"") and the 1956 award to Robert A. Heinlein's *Double Star*.

*The Lord of the Rings* retained a somewhat low profile until 1965, when Ace Books used a copyright loophole to issue an unauthorised American paperback edition of the book in its original three volumes. A legal kerfuffle and fan backlash followed which eventually led to the issuing of an authorised paperback edition and Ace Books agreeing to pay royalties on their pirated version of the book. The ""war over Middle-earth"" made national headlines and catapulted the book to superstardom, as it was then picked up by young British and American readers and became part (not entirely to Tolkien's approval) of the 1960s counter-culture movement.

In 1966, the Hugo Awards introduced a one-off ""Best All-Time Series"" category. It was widely assumed by many (but most notably Isaac Asimov) that the award was introduced solely to reward *The Lord of the Rings* and to make up for the book's initial publication being overlooked. Surprisingly, the award went instead to Asimov's **Foundation Trilogy**, as it then was. Although few could argue with anything remotely approaching a straight face that Asimov's work was of greater literary merit, it was inarguably Science Fiction with a capital S and a capital F, and Tolkien's fantasy was once again left out in the cold.

With J.R.R. Tolkien dying in 1973, it would appear that his chances of winning a Hugo would have been reduced to zero. However, his life's work and what he regarded as his *magnum opus*, *The Silmarillion*, remained unpublished. Working to his directions, his son and literary executor Christopher Tolkien, assisted by future fantasy author (and likewise inexplicably non-winning, and even more inexplicably, non-shortlisted) Guy Gavriel Kay, organised *The Silmarillion* into a publishable form and the book was released in 1977. Although ""difficult"" and unusual in structure, *The Silmarillion* received critical praise and modest commercial success, and would seem to have been a shoe-in for the 1978 Hugo Award.

Instead, it didn't even make the shortlist: Frederick Pohl's *Gateway* won the award and was joined by nominees Marion Zimmer Bradley (*The Forbidden Tower*), Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle (*Lucifer's Hammer*), Gordon R. Dickson (*Time Storm*) and some obscure guy called George R.R. Martin (for his debut novel, *Dying of the Light*).

*The Silmarillion* not even being nominated would seem unlikely, and it turns out that it actually *was* nominated and may have even got enough votes to make the shortlist, but [it was kept out by pedantry](http://file770.com/barkley-so-glad-you-didnt-ask-a-column-of-unsolicited-opinions-52/?fbclid=IwAR14t1g9s5WVdpCRYq501IJlCdWfOEwE94ibW0fZv1pt-u4VVty24_lkGwQ#comment-1207868): a man named Jim Corrick who was in charge of eligibility that year deemed that *The Silmarillion* was a short story collection containing a novel-length work (the *Quenta Silmarillion*) and thus if people had specifically nominated the *Quenta Silmarillion*, it would have made the shortlist, but since they didn't, it didn't.

It seems that at this point interest in getting Tolkien a Hugo Award evaporated: *Unfinished Tales* and its constituent stories were not nominated in 1981, and none of the twelve volumes of **The** **History of Middle-earth** was nominated for Best Related Work. *The Children of Hurin* (2008), *Beren and Luthien* (2017) and *The Fall of Gondolin* (2018) would have been of questionable eligibility, since they were repackaged material that had been previously published many years earlier. However, a case could have been made for them and for the latter two making the entire Middle-earth legendarium eligible for the Hugo Award for Best Series, but it seems no attempt was made.

Tolkien himself was probably vaguely aware of the Hugo Awards. He was a fan of Isaac Asimov's fiction in the 1950s and 1960s, and during the tussle with Ace Books, he had been in communication with the SFWA (Science Fiction Writers of America) over the matter. He also had built up an extensive body of correspondence with American fans of his work. It is, however, unlikely that he spent a huge amount of time worrying about not winning awards. The immense fan recognition of his work and the resulting ""grosser forms of literary success"" as he put it (i.e. lots of money) was reward in itself. 

Still, although Tolkien himself never won a Hugo, adaptations of his work finally did. Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* won the last-ever Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 2002, and *The Two Towers* and *The Return of the King* won the first Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation (Long Form) in 2003 and 2004 respectively. And the list of ""influential writers who never won a Hugo Award"" is distinguished company, also consisting of Gene Wolfe, Terry Pratchett and Iain Banks (among many others).",Fantasy

1563040610.0,I'm giving up on Wheel of Time after the 6th book. Just can't do it anymore,"Ok time for a bit of a rant. First things first, I'll acknowledge the first question most likely to come up: why did I even read through 6 books in a series I didn't like? Well, I really wanted to like WoT. The potential was there for it to be great and you can't go two threads in this sub without someone bringing it up as one of the great epic series, so I really wanted to like it.

But unfortunately, no matter how much I tried, I can't do it. IN MY OPINION WoT is terrible, and I find the overwhelming praise it gets on r/fantasy pretty baffling. There are *some* good things about it, but they are far overshadowed by what's *not* good. Here's what I liked:

\- Worldbuilding is solid. There's a deep lore and history in this world and most of it is fairly interesting - in fact, the history is more interesting than the current events.

\- Some nice battle scenes. Dumai Wells in particular was great and probably the high-point of the whole series up till now for me

\- Mat is great. I'd read a separate series just about him without his idiot friends.

Now for what I *didn't* like:

\- The characters. Oh boy, the characters are absolutely terrible (other than Mat). The female characters especially so. Reading through these books, it occurred to me - has Robert Jordan ever met a normal woman in his life? Because based on the female characters in his books, the only girls he's come across are annoying, mean and petty shrews that only exist to insult men and tear each other down. The female characters are HORRID. Nynaeve in particular is one of the most obnoxious, grating characters I've come across in fantasy. The male characters aren't much better. Rand is the very definition of the bland, uninteresting farm boy-saves-the-world type of character. No one else is all that much more interesting. Perrin is clueless and frowns a lot. Moiraine's bodyguard, I forget his name, is your cliched stoic badass. Characters make or break a book for me, fantasy or otherwise, and is the biggest reason I just cannot with WoT

\- The sexual politics and interactions between the male and female characters are just...really weird. They're written in such a juvenile, laughably cringey way, it's like it was written for and  by a teenager. I groaned in embarrassment at some of the descriptions of the interactions between characters. From the female-to-female, or female-to-male interactions - there is just such a weird childish overtone to it all

\- The pacing is excruciatingly slow. I don't mind a slow burn at all, but there has to be interesting things happening. Characters need to be growing and developing. None of that here. I feel like for like a good 80% of the entirety of the 6 books, nothing actually *happened*. Everything significant happens in the last few chapters and the rest of it is reading about a bunch of annoying, unlikable characters in their childish little myopic worlds

\- The story/plot is cliched and not really that interesting. It's yet another lowly nobody and his plucky comrades become uber strong badasses because magic and fights he Dark Lord. There no interesting spin to it, no personality. It's just supersized, stretched out and bloated. The Seanchan were probably the only interesting wrinkle in the story

\- The writing is functional at best. I don't need Gene Wolfe or Patricia McKillip level prose in every novel, but it'd be nice to have some beautiful language everything else sucks. Kingkiller had a shitty story and characters too, but Rothfuss could write like a motherfucker. WoT doesn't even have that. Sanderson's prose sucks too but at least his stories are fun and exciting, usually.

In the end, it's really my fault, for continuing to hit my head against the wall (and these brick-sized tomes) over and over again hoping it'd get better. Looking back, I can't see or think of a bigger waste of time in my life than reading these 6 books.

Some moments are hard, but I know those moment will turn into fond memories as time passes. I can't stress enough how much this community meant to him, we didn't trust a lot of people to tell us what to read... but we trusted you. 

mods, I hope this is ok. My bud was an active follower of the sub. I don’t know how often he posted here, but we shared posts with each other all the time. As you can see, the books we all post about, and the active authors in this community were a big part of his life. While not related to any single piece of literature or author, I thought this was an appropriate thing to share with our community. 

A few weeks ago I lost a very close friend. I don’t feel comfortable sharing his name, so I’ll call him Rain. 

He struggled with depression for years and passed away in mid-May. I’m posting this here because, while him and I shared many interests, Fantasy literature was the thing that connected us most closely. 

In many ways Rain was the single greatest influence on my reading. 

We had been friendly for a while, but about 10 years we found out that we both loved fantasy literature. We shared suggestions and compared notes as we made our way through each others’ favorite series. I remember how excited he was when I finished The Black Company. I think it was the first time he found someone, outside of his family, to share this stuff with. 

He suggested The Black Company, Night Angel, and Riyria, to name a few. 

And then he told me to read Name of the Wind. Unbeknownst to me, he hadn’t read it, but for some reason, was interested in my opinion. I read it, and loved it. I googled “books like…” and found this sub-Reddit. In turn, I shared it with him. What a door that opened. 

We devoured countless new, to us, authors, GGK hit me the hardest. For him, it was Lawrence (more on this later). At first, we read on our own and suggested books we finished. Eventually, we started reading the same book at the same time. One of the first was Hawkins, Library at Mount Char. We loved it, literally sharing random texts about it for years after reading it. 

With Lawrence, we read most of the books together, like a two person book club. The Impossible Times books ripped out our hearts. They are so beautiful and, at times, so sad. Rain was not usually an emotional person, but those got to him. He read chapter 16 of the first book 3 times before moving on. It seems crazy that I know that, but the chapter spoke to him so deeply that we talked about it for years. 

We also bought The Book of the Ancestor novels as they were released and read them all when Holy Sister came out. We literally read the first line of the first book prior to release and committed to the trilogy. “It is important, when killing a nun, to ensure that you bring an army of sufficient size. For Sister Thorn of the Sweet Mercy Convent Lano Tacsis brought two hundred men.” 

We were doing the same with the Book of Ice. It breaks my heart to know I won’t be reading this with him. 

A few weeks before he died he sent me screen shots of an AMA Mark Lawrence did. Mark responded to some of Rain’s questions and he was thrilled. He was such a huge fan and has so much respect for Mark that it meant the world to him. Mark, if you read this, he was a “massive” fan and we loved sharing your stories. 

Marks reply sparked a conversation about the Books of Bable. We read the first novel right before Josiah Bancroft went to Orbit. I have been saving them for book 4 but Rain read them as they released. He wanted to talk about them and was giving be grief for waiting. 

Last week Benedict Patrick shared that the cover was released for book 4 and I instantly pulled up a text for Rain. He had passed away a week before, but texting him about this stuff is (was) second nature to me. 

Speaking of Orbit. Him and I went to NY Comic Con every year, and we spent an abnormally long time in the publishers second. The  plush carpet helped, but really it was our love of books. At the Orbit booth this amazing rep sold us hard on Broken Earth. Rain bought the trilogy from her, but we shelved it for a few years. He started on a whim and called me immediately. “Jemisin writes a POV in SECOND person. You have to start this, now.” I could tell he was serious. I put my Drizzit novel on pause and picked up The Fifth Season. I had the same knee jerk reaction to text him when I read that Sony was adapting it. 

I could go on, but you all get the point. I lost someone very close to me and it was our love of reading, specifically fantasy, that connected us. 

I guess I just wanted to post this here to thank this community. The mods, the people posting, those commenting and all of our amazing authors. This community provided Rain and I with an endless supply of stories to read and share. It hurts now, when I read a post that I would normally send to him, but I’m sure that, in time, that pain will turn into gratitude. Gratitude to have had a friend that I shared such an important thing with. These stories you tell, the ones we share with each-other, the recommendations and criticisms… all of it, it gave him so much joy. It’s reassuring to know it will continue on and that it will always remind me of him. 

So thank you all.",Fantasy

This annoys me. Because first of all, how are the characters supposed to _measure_ 15 minutes? Are they wearing wristwatches? More importantly, how are they even familiar with the concept of minutes? How have they gotten the habit of measuring time in minutes?

As I see it, if you grew up without easy access to clocks, you wouldn't _think_ in minutes. You might know what _hours_ are, because there might be something like hourglasses or church bells that ring every hour. And when you have an idea of what an hour is, you might be able to roughly estimate half an hour or even a quarter of an hour, but nothing more precise than that. And I think the average person's estimate of ""a quarter of an hour"" will be extremely unreliable.

When characters think and talk in terms of minutes, it yanks me out of the story and makes the worldbuilding seem sloppy.",Fantasy

1644159488.0,"WHEEL OF TIME renewed for a third season at Amazon, with a fourth in the offing","**The Wheel of Time** has been renewed for a third season at Amazon Prime Video, with a pickup for a fourth season also potentially on the way.

The news, somewhat obliquely, came [in a Deadline article](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/7703856341303488608/4104348301820021767#) discussing the return of **Criminal Minds**. As cast-watchers should be aware, **Wheel of Time** star Daniel Henney was a regular on both **Criminal Minds** and one of its spin-offs for several years. During the article, Deadline confirms that **Wheel of Time** has been picked up for ""two more seasons.""

It's unclear whether Deadline was including the already-filming Season 2, which wraps in the next few weeks, in their count. If not, **Wheel of Time** will make it to fourth season, halfway through its planned eight-season run. If not, the show will definitely get a third year.

This is a bit of a no-brainer. Despite a mixed critical reception, especially its divisive season finale, **Wheel of Time** became Amazon's biggest-ever TV premiere when it launched in November, outperforming the likes of **The Boys**, **Carnival Row**, **The Grand Tour** and **Invincible**. Greenlighting a third season well ahead of a time will be essential to keep the gap between the second and third seasons to a minimum, and greenlighting a fourth season would be advantageous in allowing the production team to plan out future episodes and storylines, as well as creating a schedule that works with their much in-demand lead actor, Rosamund Pike.

Amazon have not yet confirmed the news, but Deadline (along with Variety and the Hollywood Reporter) is usually very on the ball with this kind of news.

Season 2 of **The Wheel of Time** is expected to air late this year or early next.",Fantasy

1669079767.0,I finished Harry Potter and I feel disappointed,"Harry Potter has always existed peripherally in my mind. I never caught up with the hype as a kid and as an adult, the fans soured me on it with how overly maudlin they were about both the series and Jk Rowling as a person. But ever since Rowling came out as TERF, there seems to have been a huge reactionary push to either see Harry Potter as the most intricately written piece of modern literature and if you criticize it, you're wrong and only criticizing it because you're bitter about Rowling. Or it's a humungous piece of shit and you're a piece of shit for liking them.

Starting a few months back, I decided to finally read all seven books. And....they're fine. But that's just it; they're just fine. They aren't dogshit but  I genuinely do not understand the insane amount of hype that these books generated. Especially the sheer amount of adults that act like this is the only book series aimed at children that has dipped into dark themes.

Books 1-3 are genuinely good mystery books for kids. The writing is digestible, the tone is light and the world is very fun and whimsical. Book 3 is by far the best in the whole series. Around Book 4, when Rowling decided to make them more realistic, the world kind of falls apart and loses what made it good. Book 5 had a bad central mystery but made up for the great characterizations of Sirius and Harry. Half-Blood Prince is one of the most boring fantasy books I've read. And Deathly Hallows was a cluster fuck of clunkily done Christian allegories, Harry acting like a psychotic asshole to everyone around him, the main trio using unforgivable curses with no repercussions, and dues ex Machina wand lore.

The biggest problem I have is that books started on a shallow premise of a Roald Dahl-esque wizard where kids go to wizard middle school and Rowling attempts to squeeze a YA dark, political fantasy out of that in the later books. The magic system is whatever the plot calls for in that book. And that works for the whimsical, rubber hose logic the earlier books run off of. It makes no sense in the later books.

The same goes for the other intrigues of the world. In a children's book series, I can have a suspension of disbelief when it comes to Hogwarts and its staff. In a realistic setting, Hogwarts is a dangerous hellhole and its staff is either incompetent morons or child abusers. And Rowling never attempts to mend the gap by jumping to a more serious tone. So the later books have this tug-of-war between being a fanciful series for small children and an overly somber, grim fantasy series for tweens.

When Rowling does attempt include serious topics and themes, she comes off as a very sheltered person who hasn't been outside of their insulated town. The analogies to real-world socio-political problems are at best confusing and at worst, offensive. I don't even know what she was trying to say with the whole house-elf thing. The house elves are intentionally written as sympathetic beings who are abused by wizarding society. And yet every-time Hermione brings it up, Harry or Ron rolls their eyes and it's portrayed like it's one of Hermione's annoying quirks.

The ""Werewolves are a stand-in for people with HIV"" was the most egregious to me personally. They are only two named Werewolves in the series; Remus Lupin, the depressed but kind mentor figure to Harry who resents being a werewolf. And Fenrir Greyback; a cannibalistic, rapist, pedophile who purposefully targets kids to infect. I can't tell if this Rowling is this obtuse or not but it's pretty fucking awful that her HIV allegory plays into a stereotype that still affects HIV victims.

A lot of the good female characters are reduced to either being love interests or moms. Hermione, Luna, and Mcgonagall are the only female characters that come to mind whose lives are not molded around the male characters. And even then, Hermione is often portrayed as this overly nagging mom friend to Ron and Harry. Ginny is pretty much absent for three books and then comes back in book 6 to become Harry's manic pixie dream girl. Tonks gets downgraded to being a catalyst for Remus's angst in book 7. And if they are villains, a lot of Rowling's internalized misogyny comes out. They're overly feminine which I guess to Rowling is a horrible trait to have. 

As for Snape...he's not the intricately woven ""gray"" character like a lot of people said. I understand that this point has been beaten into the ground. But Snape is a cartoon, Roald Dahl-esque villain for the majority of the books. And in the last book, the narrative plays Snape's obsession as a heroic quality about him and not insanely weird and a piss-poor motivation. He's a poorly written Byronic hero and that has somehow translated into meaning that he's a deeply profound character.

Idk, I guess expected a lot more from it based on how people talk about it. There are some beautiful lines of dialogue and Rowling's is good at making character's feel like real people when feels like it. But I feel like a lot of the hype and fawning around Harry Potter comes from nostalgia, the movies, and the humungous advertisement campaign in the early 2000s rather than the quality of the books.",Fantasy

1601082822.0,"Opinion: The ""classic"" fantasy setting isn't Medieval, it's Roman with Medieval costumes","*EDIT: Wow, this got more attention than I expected, both positive and negative. Four awards on one side (thanks, guys!) and a lot of intense (and usually valid) criticism in the comments on the other, often because I didn't express myself very well. Let me see if I can clear some things up:*

1. *Fantasy usually isn't trying to be based on any specific era. That's why it's fantasy---it's meant to be unreal and unusual. I would argue that most of the time, fantasy settings are based on Medieval tropes; that's what I'm reacting to. Stories that are only loosely and accidentally based on these themes---like the Inheritance Cycle---are just as valid and enjoyable as ones deliberately trying to emulate them---like the Traitor Son Cycle. The Middle Ages really are fun; I'm just suggesting that the classic fantasy setting has less in common with that period than people usually realize.*
2. *This post is intended to be a lighthearted attempt to spark discussion, not an academic statement. In that vein, many points are gross over-generalizations; history is complex, and both the Middle Ages and the Roman state existed for about 1000 years each. If I were to be more specific, I'm referring to Western Europe in the High Middle Ages (though I reference Constantinople at one point) and the Late Western Roman Empire.*
3. *Related to the last point: I am not a professional historian for either of these eras. This post comes from about six months of research on my free time, mostly about Roman history. There are many things that I haven't yet discovered, especially about Medieval Europe. Feel free to let me know what I got wrong, especially if you can let me know where to learn more. If you'd like some sources, my most recently-read books are The Roman Army by Pat Southern, The Logistics of the Roman Army at War by Jonathan Roth, De Militari by Vegetius, and De Medicus by Celsus; the other sources have been looked at too long ago for me to remember off the top of my head.*

*Thank you so much for your support and input!*

I wish I could come up with a better description of what I mean by ""classic"" fantasy setting; of course now that I've started writing this, most of the examples I had in my head have left. All I've got left is Lord of the Rings, the Inheritance Cycle, Elder Scrolls games, and Witcher series. Hopefully over the course of this post it'll make more sense.

So I've been doing a lot of research lately on Medieval and ancient societies---especially warfare---to make my stories more life-like. As part of that, I've discovered that a strictly Medieval setting is pretty restrictive, while shifting focus to the Roman Empire loosens things up a bit.

&#x200B;

Here are some of the pesky elements of the Medieval period:

* Complex and constraining social systems of feudalism and manorialism (who wants to deal with the intricacies of corvee labor?)
* Poor agricultural technology leads to low urbanization (in 1100 Constantinople was one of the biggest cities at 200,000 people) and career diversity (only 1 in 10 people *weren't* farmers)
* Strict monotheistic religion (not that big of a problem, but most classic settings prefer polytheism)
* Warfare (one of my favorites)
   * Small army sizes (usually \~10,000 max) and no standing army
   * Soldiers are often levies of peasants with swords supported by nobles on horses
   * No standardized units, formations, or complex tactics
   * Bizarre and confusing chains of command (one of the reasons the French lost at Agincourt was because the nobles couldn't decide who was in charge) with no soldier ranks
   * Little to no logistical support or organization

&#x200B;

Now let's go into all of the fun things that become possible if we go with the Roman Empire:

* Relatively loose social and political systems, even a primitive version of nations and sovereignty
* More advanced agricultural technology allows higher urbanization (at its height, Rome had 500,000 people) and career diversity (4 non-farmers out of 10 people)
* Polytheistic religion with acceptance of local variants
* Warfare
   * Massive standing armies (the British Isles alone had over 50,000 soldiers in 135 AD)
   * Career soldiers that build their entire professional lives around war
   * Highly standardized units and formations; military manuals discussing tactics and other aspects of war
   * Clear chain of command with ranks and officers
   * Developed logistics with supply lines and corps of engineers, medical personnel, and other specialists

&#x200B;

Now, there are some fun bits of the Medieval Era that can be adopted by the classic fantasy setting:

* Clothes and manners of speech
* Noble titles (royalty, peerage, knights, etc.)
* Mythological inspiration (dragons, fae, etc.)
* Weapons, armor, and other military technology (siege weapons, castles, etc.)

&#x200B;

So if you're like me and like to base your tales on what's realistically possible (ignore the magic and monsters), don't look at Medieval Europe---look at the Roman Empire. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.",Fantasy

1603214974.0,Guide for recommending Malazan,"This is not a final say on the matter, I would be glad if others expanded the list or challenged some of the points I made. No spoilers here.

***I want to read an epic fantasy story with huge scope*** \-  Yes, easy recommend. It takes place on several continents with many different characters. Scope is what Malazan is about.

***I want to read about deep fantasy characters, to really get to know them and intimately understand them*** \- Pass. Malazan has great characters. Some of my favorite characters in all of fiction. But character work is done very differently compared to other books. Erikson recently made a Facebook essay on the subject of characterization, and while I completely agree with him, I understand why people find his character work off-putting.

***I want a book with a lot of lore and worldbuilding that is intertwined with the main plot*** \- Easy recommend. Malazan is all about lore, history and mythology.

***I am tired of long series and getting into a ten books series is too much for me right now*** \- Recommend. That is right. There is a misconception about Malazan and that is if you start it you have to finish all 10 books. In reality, it starts with two duologies. Gardens of the Moon + Memories of Ice ( War on Genebackis) and Deadhouse Gates + House of Chains ( Apocalypse Uprising in Seven Cities ) both following mostly different characters on different continents pursuing different goals. Hardcore fans insist to read them in order and that only after all 10 you can properly grasp the series. But I would say you can read a duology and get the feeling of what the series is about. If you don't like it , you won't like the rest.

***I want a grimdark book*** \- Pass. It can be dark with lots of death, torture, war, even body horror. But it is not grimdark it its themes. This series is all about compassion, hope and surprisingly, friendship. My friend once called it ""Malazan Friendship is Magic"", and I thought, well he is not wrong.

***I want a lighthearted reading experience*** \- Pass. While ultimate message is about compassion, to prove that point Erikson choses to put your character through some stuff. And people go through some really horrifying stuff. It is never a fun adventure. It is war, start to finish.

***I want a book with romance*** \- Hard Pass. Just don't. No.

***I want a book with bromance*** \- Easy recommend. People have such intimate friendships that you will wish your friends are like that. Tehol and Bugg, Gesler and Stormy, Toc and Tool, Icarium and Mappo etc. Some of these made me tear up. Easily one of the best parts of the series.

***I want a book with fast pacing and lots of action*** \- Pass. Pacing can be slow. People will take several chapters to arrive at a location. But, things are always happening. That is why it is described as dense. You are always fed new information, new events, new characters etc. So while slow sometimes, it is never boring. Action is really good but action scenes can be few and far between.

***I want a book with classic fantasy tropes/ storylines*** \- Pass. While some tropes are present, usually they are either deconstructed or rejected altogether.

***I want a book with classic races*** \- Pass. All races here are straight out of Erikson's mind, some may resemble classic races in some ways, but are their own thing.

***I want a book with a diverse cast*** \- Recommend. People of different races, cultures, creeds etc. interact and work together.

***I want a book with a hard magic system*** \- Pass. Magic system is soft, fans still try to figure out exactly how it worked in some instances in books. It works because it adds a layer of mystery to the world and a sense of awe when someone unleashes their power, but it also means that with magic in Malazan, anything goes.

***I want a book where men and women are equal*** \- Recommend. Everyone can learn to use magic in this world both men and women , Malazan empire has an Empress (she did not get her position through marriage), part of her army led by her female adjunct, among Malaz marines you can find both men and women fighting etc.

***I want a book with a small cast, it is hard for me to follow too many people*** \- Pass. It has a total of 690 characters. I know Erikson did it to add to the sense of it being a true world, and he came as close as possible in fiction, but damn, it comes at a price.

***I want a book with atheistic themes*** \- Pass. Gods are real in Malazan, they are characters themselves, often interacting with mortals.

***I want a military fantasy book*** \- Recommend. It is full of war, tactics, army compositions, geography and maps.

***I want a book that will make me emotional*** \- Recommend. One of the few series that made me tear up.

***I want series with larger than life characters*** \- Hard recommend. Some of the coolest Gods, demigods, generals, warriors, wizards go all out, and it is glorious to behold.

***I want a book with great dialogue*** \- Pass. Some dialogue is great while other times it can be a bit stiff. Mixed bag overall.

***I want a book with lots of exposition and I like having things explained to me -*** Hard pass. No exposition here. For better or worse.

***I want books that escalate towards the end*** \- Recommend. Convergence of power is a big theme. At the end of each book powers converge and shit goes down.

***I want a book with great prose*** \- Maybe. Here the prose is hit or miss with some people. I hated it at first, but now it is my favorite hands down. Only way to describe it is through example. (sorry if it's bad I am no writer)

1. Average fantasy book: Ned, an immortal demigod, now the outcast of the holy order he served, saw a sandwich on the table in front of him. Hunger gripped his stomach, his mouth watering at the sight of that juicy bacon. He had to approach it, even though he knew he would be punished for stealing. Alas, hunger got the better of him and he went for it.
2. Erikson: He entered the room, only to see a sandwich laid out on the table in front of him. Was he so famished that he would break the sacred oath he made a millennia ago? He did not know. He only knew that with strange eons passing he would become enslaved to his material form, now bitter and an old shell of his former self, no sandwich in the Seven Cities could satiate his hunger. Yet for the time being, this would have to suffice.

***I want a book with political intrigue -*** Pass. There is a bit of it but it's not in the spotlight.

***I want to get into fantasy*** \- Pass. It could get overwhelming for a new reader.

***I like assassins*** \- Recommend. Erikson likes them too. Mage assassins, spy assassins, guild assassins, thief assassins, army assassins, anti-army assassins etc.

***I don't like the author killing characters*** \- Pass. People will die but it is usually done very well.

***I don't like having too many POVs*** \- Pass. There are a few too many here if you ask me.

***I want a book with good humor, actually funny comic relief -*** Recommend. Deadhouse Gates is the first book where I actually laughed out loud.

***I want a book where battles are actually exciting -*** Recommend. You will usually be in the thick of the action, as well as getting a nice overview of what is happening.

***I want a book with dragons, shapeshifters, beasts and other fantasy creatures*** \-  Recommend. Yes. Malazan has sentient dragons and other fantasy creatures that play a role in the story, not just there for decoration.

***I want you to stop, this post is way too long. -*** Recommend. I will stop, just a few more. People might find this helpful.

***Dude...***

1627989297.0,"My name is Michael J. Sullivan, author of the Riyria novels, Legends of the First Empire, and my new series (The Rise and Fall) releases today with Nolyn - AMA!","Hey all,

I'm Michael J. Sullivan, and I'm a New York Times, USA Today, and Washington Post bestselling author of four series and one standalone tale. All told that's two completed series, one ongoing, and the start of my latest series begins releasing today! That's **20 books** in all, which seems kinda crazy when I think about it.

I've been a member of r/fantasy for over 13 years, won 2 Stabby awards, and this is my 7th AMA's (I can't believe the last one was so long ago).  I'm thrilled to be with you all today. What amazing growth this forum has had over the years, and I'm always grateful for the amazing support my books have had here.

As for my writing, I'm what's referred to as a hybrid author -- someone who has worked with traditional publishers as well as self-produced indie works. Many people think I started out in the indie world, but that's not quite true.  My first book was released in 2008 by a very small press (AMI - Aspirations Media Inc), but it sold very few copies (and ultimately I didn't earn a dime from it), but because my wife is a savvy businesswoman, we switched to self-publishing in 2009 when the publisher didn't have the money to produce the print run for the second book.  By 2010, the self-publishing gig was going well, so we tried for traditional publishing, and it worked.  I've published 8 books with Orbit  3 with Del Rey, 1 with Tachyon Publishing, and 13 through self-publishing.  These days I'm 100% indie (and if you want to know why, just ask - this is an AMA after all.

As for what I've written - here's how it breaks down:

* **The Riyria Revelations** (completed and published by Orbit it's a 6-book series sold in 3, 2-book Omnibus editions: Theft of Swords | Rise of Empire | Heir of Novron)
* **The Riyria Chronicles** (1/2 published by Orbit and 1/2 indie produced is my ongoing series): The Crown Tower | The Rose and the Thorn | The Death of Dulgath | The Disappearance of Winter's Daughter). Next up in that series will be Drumindor (but I don't have a release date yet)
* **Legends of the First Empire** (completed and 1/2 published by Del Rey and 1/2 indie produced) Age of Myth | Age of Swords | Age of War | Age of Legend | Age of Death | Age of Empyre
* **The Rise and Fall Trilogy** (indie published which is releasing a book a year each summer of 2021, 2022, 2023: Nolyn | Farilane | Esrahaddon)
* **Hollow World:** Standalone sci-fi time-travel thriller

My fantasy audiobooks are narrated by the amazing Tim Gerard Reynolds, and the cover designs feature Marc Simonetti. My wife is my business partner and knows A LOT about publishing and the business side of writing. She's graciously volunteered to join me in the AMA so if you have any questions for Robin, just mark them as such.

Since today is release day for Nolyn, I should mention a bit about it.  Here's the ""back of the book"" marketing blurb:

After more than five hundred years of exile, the heir to the empyre is wary about his sudden reassignment to active duty on the Goblin War’s front lines. His mission to rescue an outpost leads to a dead-end canyon deep inside enemy territory, and his suspicion turns to dread when he discovers the stronghold doesn't exist. But whoever went to the trouble of planning his death to look like a casualty of war didn't know he would be assigned to the Seventh Sikaria Auxiliary Squadron. In the depths of an unforgiving jungle, a legend is about to be born, and the world of Elan will never be the same.

I'll be back around throughout the day to answer questions, and if I don't get through them all by the time the day is over, I'll answer them over the next few days. Feel free to ask anything it can be about writing, publishing, the book business as a whole, or my books in particular. But please do use spoiler tags so others can visit this thread without fear of finding out something they would rather read about in the books.

EDIT: It's past midnight here and way past my bedtime. I'll be back to clean up any questions I missed, and to answer any new ones that come in. But thainks, all, for a day of fun ""hanging out with yall.""  As I head off to bed, the release is going well. The Audiobook is in the top 10 of all audiobooks  (#1 in Fantasy, Epic Fantasy, and Historical fantasy).  The ebook is at 462 - quite respectable for this stage of the release. Combined with the amazing Kickstarter (raised ore than $200,000 in pre-order sales), we can safely say Nolyn has had an awesome release.",Fantasy

[Information requested: how to read all of Will Wight's books without giving him a dime. 

Beginning report...]

**Will Wight Giveaway**, celebrating ten years of writing! By series (US Amazon):

Traveler's Gate Trilogy - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CCBXYZ

Traveler's Gate Side Stories - https://www.amazon.com/Travelers-Gate-Chronicles-Complete-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00Z92K3PG

Elder Empire Trilogy (Shadow) - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CCVM2J

Elder Empire Trilogy (Sea) - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074C78XPJ

The Last Horizon - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C11YDHB8

Cradle - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0753FP6SP

**Traveler's Gate** is progression-adjacent fantasy following the friend of the chosen one. **Elder Empire** is this weird dual trilogy (each book has a counterpart from the other side happening at the same time) with eldritch horror themes. **Last Horizon** is the newest series with just one book so far, science fantasy following a wizard-with-a-gun as he puts together a team to pilot an ancient spaceship.

**Cradle** is the main thing he's famous for, a super fast paced western Xianxia series about a boy going from crippled to OP, in a genre where people regularly go around punching the local equivalent of gods. Eleven books out so far, and the last will be out in a week. Generally considered the flagship series of the r/progressionfantasy subgenre, you cannot go more than half a thread there without someone recommending Cradle.

Edit: a note on the **audiobooks** from u/cwil40 -

>Worth adding that after “purchasing” for $0 you can add Audible audio for $1.99 on each of these books.
>
>Edit to add: Pro-tip, don’t “purchase” the kindle versions that are bundles of 3 novels. Buy them all individually. Once you have purchased a book, the following screen (where it says “thank you for purchasing xyz”) should give you the option to “add whispersync audio” or “add audible narration” and this should cost $1.99 per book.

Edit2: The giveaway should also work on non-US Amazon sites if you find his author page, e.g. [Canada](https://www.amazon.ca/Will-Wight/e/B00D9S1IMO), [Germany](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Will-Wight/e/B00D9S1IMO), [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Will-Wight/e/B00D9S1IMO)

1599907924.0,*Willow* (1988) deserves more appreciation.,"Willow is one of the very best ""high fantasy"" movies. It has a great, if predictable, plot with some memorable performances and effects that hold up exceptionally well for a movie made over a quarter of a century ago. 

And yet this movie gets zero love. 

Its a dark and at times even grisly film. It has mystery and enchantment. Love and battle. A typical good vs evil arch but it also cleverly and believably portrays hate and cruelty contested by friendship, love, and furthermore, redemption. I think Willow has some of the very best character growth in a fantasy movie, much less one supposed to be for children. 

Hell its a PG movies but has more red blood in it than the Lord of the Rings movies. And some seriously gruesome effects to boot. Tack on a few objectively incredible battle scenes, a great chase scene, and some comic relief. Its just great. The whole movie is paced wonderfully. And it has a beautifully scored soundtrack. 

And then on top of it all there's Madmartigan. One of the best scoundrel anti heros on film. 

All in all I think Willow deserves higher regard, especially from fantasy fans.


Edit: I didn't mean this to trigger anybody. I simply never hear it talked about any more. Plenty of other ""older"" movies still garner tons of attention. I guess I stand corrected. Also Im 38 and saw Willow at the drive in with my family in 1988 not some kid that thinks he's the the first person to discover the movie. I guess I should have just said Willow is great and if you haven't seen it you should. Glad to know so many others feel the same.",Fantasy

1664452812.0,3000 Books Read Over 15 Years,"Yesterday I just finished the 3000th book since I started tracking which books I read (and when) since June 2007. I thought it might be fun to look back at the last 15 years of reading—numbers and otherwise (if you’re wondering why I think this is fun, please recall that I worked on the r/Fantasy Bingo Statistics posts for 5 years).

In 2007 I created a spreadsheet to to track both my reading as well as all the books I *wanted* to read (and which libraries had the books I wanted). Even though I say it’s 3000 books, there are some things I didn’t count that others might (picture books that I read to my son, no short stories shorter than a novella, and no required readings for university classes), and some things I *do* count that others might not (rereads, manga/comic book volumes, and magazine issues).

[Table of Books Read per Month\/Year](https://preview.redd.it/c4jyeukybqq91.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b63cbc3364d1dd22c0227e050bbffb0bd349b3b)

A few facts you may be able to figure out from above:

* I was in school until spring 2009.
* I didn't get a job until the end of 2010.
* I binged comics/manga like *crazy* in the 5 highest total months above (Jan & Feb 2010, Jan 2011, Oct 2012, and Sep 2013)
* My son was born at the beginning of 2018.
* January and August are my best months on average for reading; April and December are my worst months.

But wait! I have more! (The points below are just stat summaries of the 3000-book totals; I'll discuss some of the changes or trends in the Conclusion section.)

* **Author/Editor Gender:** 59% of books (1775) were written by men, 33% (1000) were written by women, 1% (26) were written by nonbinary authors, and 7% (199) were written by mixed-gender authors (including anthologies edited by men with non-male contributors).
* **Genre:** 78% (2325) of the books I read were speculative fiction (science fiction, fantasy, alternate history, or a mix thereof), 15% (439) were not (fiction, historical, mysteries/thrillers, and romances without SF/F elements) , and 8% (237) were nonfiction books (mostly histories).
* **SF:** Of the 2325 SF/F books that I read, 1275 (55%) were clearly fantasy, 778 (33%) were clearly science fiction, and 271 (12%) were a mix of the two (or alternate history without any other SF/F elements).
* **Borrowing:** 59% of books (1779) were from the library or borrowed from a friend.
* **Format:** 73% (2177) were print books; 26% (769) were ebooks, and 2% (54) were audiobooks.
* **Short Fiction:** 304 books (10%) were anthologies, collections, or magazines. 194 books (6%) were novellas. While I don't have historical data for individual short stories I've read not included above, I started this year, and I have 32 stories read so far, nearly all as one-offs from magazines or newsletters.
* **Graphic Novels/Manga:** 930 (31%) were graphic novels, manga, or comic collections (no single issues or chapters).
* **Translations:** 16% (489) were translated books or included translated stories. Only 19% of those translations (93) weren’t comics. I don’t currently track the original language, but I think a vast majority are from Japanese.
* **Series:** 2005 (67%) were part of a series, with 501 books were the first in their respective series. I had 444 (15%) standalone novels. (I didn’t count nonfiction or magazines “series”).
* **Debut Novels:** 209 (7%) were debut novels (I tried not to include debut novellas or collections, just first novels).
* **Rereads:** 218 (7%) were rereads.
* **How Soon I Read a Book:** 2% (63) were read within a week of publication; 246 (8%) within 2 months; 664 (22%) within a year, and 41% (1216) were read within 3 years of publication.

**CONCLUSION**

One thing that the stat summaries hide is how differently I read in recent years. The last 7 years I actually read an average of 50% books as ebooks, even though my overall numbers since 2007 show half that percentage. I only got my first e-reader in 2012, and it took a few years before I realized my library had ebooks to drive that number up. I also only started listening to audiobooks in the last 4 years, and I listen to about 13 per year (and only nonfiction audiobooks).

Another statistic that surprised me was my gender ratio (59 M/33 F). I would say that the last 5 years I’m reading more like equal numbers or even more women than men, but those early years really put me in a hole so to speak. Unfortunately, a lot of the American comics I’ve read tend to be written by male authors, so those numbers really tilt one way, especially if it’s a series I binge (most of the U.S. comics I’ve read by women/nonbinary people have been standalone or trilogies).

A fun thing I’ve enjoyed in looking at my spreadsheet statistics is seeing what appears to be a large or small number and trying to figure out what’s causing it in particular. For example, I tend not to reread very many books (I only have 3 for 2022), but I had large jumps in 2012 (Fullmetal Alchemist & Wheel of Time), 2014 (Dresden Files), and 2020 (Valdemar). I also had a random surge of books from the 1920s-40s in 2012, and that was just because of Agatha Christie.

I also noticed that I started reading about 48-60% newer books (within the last 3 years) for 2014-19 and then also 2021. Last year (2021) was because of reading for the Hugos for the first time, but I’m still not quite sure why I started reading more recent fiction for 2014-19. That might have been when I got more active on r/Fantasy or started following more book bloggers.

I was amused to see certain authors on my top list as some of them I haven’t read in ages, such as the 72 manga volumes from Clamp, as I haven’t read them in over 9 years, and they’re still my top overall. It’s been almost 6 years since I’ve read anything by David Weber, and over 11 since I’ve read Alan Dean Foster.

Anyway, all of the above is just a snapshot into my reading life, and I hope it proves interesting to some. Happy to answer any questions or look up a statistic someone’s interested in.",Fantasy

1612006212.0,Lies of Locke Lamora was best fantasy book I've read since started reading again back in late 2019 and trying many recs from this sub.,"I've been trying to get back into habit of reading, and asked for recommendations. People recommended me Mistborn, Stormlight Archive, Warbreaker, Belgariad, Kingkiller Chronicles, Discworld, Farseer, and while I did enjoy them all so some extent, every one of them had some significant flaw that wouldn't make me see them as one of my favorites.

Some were rather poorly and unimaginatively written, some were too long and bloated despite being not that eventful, some had uncompelling characters, and some were just constantly sad and depressing. Discworld could be an exception as I really loved it, but it's not the kind of story that makes you immersed and really live through it. But I don't want to just complain about them, I did enjoy reading all of them after all.

But recently, I picked up Lies of Locke Lamora, and it really ticked almost all the right boxes.

The writing style complements the story well and greatly helped me visualize events and places without delving onto countless descriptions and details just for the sake of worldbuilding. I also loved how detailed the fight scenes were. The prose is neither too flowery nor robotic, and there's just something about it that really allowed my imagination to actually paint pictures before my eyes.

The pacing is awesome, the book despite its length never drags, and even these flashbacks are very well placed in the context of the main story.

The characters are vivid and their dialogues are stellar, but what I like most about the way they are written is that the author leaves a lot of room for you to fill in the spaces with your imagination while providing some guidelines for their looks, personality etc. Also - show don't tell, one line like ""nice bird, asshole"" in its context tells you 100 times more about Locke than an entire paragraph devoted to describing how pugnacious he is.

The tone is also great (that point is entirely a preference though). It's not grimdark (although i have no idea for the real definition for grimdark), but there are some heavy moments in this book. The difference to some more bleak series is how the characters react to these things happening to them. They don't really wallow in their misery and hopelessness too much, and usually try to overcome it.

It's not a sprawling high fantasy full of wonder and adventure, but for what the author set out to do, it's pretty much perfect (for me of course).

>!I didn't really like that Sanza brothers and Bug died, because their chemistry with each other was  so great, but from the storytelling perspective it made perfect sense, it was a real gut punch and a driving force for Locke and Jean to get revenge.!<

By the way, how the hell was it never made into a movie/tv series (apart from not being yet finished I guess) ? It wouldn't even need a massive budget as there's barely any actual visual magic in it, at least in the first one.

And by the way, I do plan to check out some less popular series soon, instead of just picking everything from the top 10 most popular ones.",Fantasy

1641572338.0,I admit I like The Hobbit more than Lord of the Rings,"I always felt it was kind of funny that The Hobbit gets ignored in most criticisms of Tolkien. I'm an academic with classes in JRR so I get exposed to them more but usually, the surface readings of it always go on about pro-monarchy sentiments and divine rights of kings, fallen ages, and evil races. However, if you read The Hobbit, it actually feels like Tolkien is sending up his own critics' ideas of himself.

Thorin is the one true king of the dwarves and as blue blooded/divine right of kings as they come. He's also a complete ass. Thorin is constantly leading the group into disaster, a frankly terrible leader, and a bit of a coward as he sends Bilbo into the dragon's den first. He also almost ends up in a pointless war with the elves and humans over gold. The Elf King isn't much better and Bard fully intends to march on the Lonely Mountain to rob the joint. Though, to be fair, Bard perhaps has a point that the dwarves brought ruin on his people.

The elves, dwarves, and races of men are traditionally the ""good"" races of fantasy but with the exception of Elrond, they're pretty much always at each other's throats the entirety of the book. What manages to unite men and elves is initially gold and later a mutual threat that is properly portrayed as ragingly hypocritical. The cartoon version always stuck with my 5 year old self that the various leaders immediately sided with one another only when the goblins were at the gates.

(I actually give Tolkien props for the fact that instead of the dwarves being money grubbing gold-lovers like certain stereotypes--it's actually elves, humans, AND dwarves who are greedy sons of bitches)

I also feel like even the treatment of the goblins is softer in The Hobbit than in LOTR. Yes, they're the bad guys but the dwarves and Gandalf murdered their king. They did so because the king was justifiably upset they were carrying around Hate Crime SwordsTM. How would you react?

Indeed, I think this is probably why the Hobbit movies utterly failed for me because the movies lacked any sort of subversive quality to them. It feels weird to read the Hobbit as subversive since it predates modern fantasy as we know it but even then, it was the story of the rotund middle aged useless gentryman instead of the plucky farm boy.",Fantasy

1609517269.0,The Dragons of JRR Tolkien,"Happy New Year everyone!

When it comes to fantasy, it’s hard to imagine that there’s any creature more ubiquitous or universal than the dragon. We have Dungeons and Dragons, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Skyrim, World of Warcraft,...Shrek. It seems wherever you look, if it’s in the fantasy genre, there’s a good chance you’ll find a fire-breathing dragon. And although it would be a definite overstatement to suggest that Tolkien invented dragons as we know them, I do believe that without him, they wouldn’t be so so familiar to the modern reader. I think it can be argued that *Smaug the Golden* is both the first great dragon of contemporary fantasy, and the last great dragon of the old Germanic, Slavic, and wider European mythologies. Smaug is the reason that although you may you struggle to picture a manticore, or a cockatrice, every single one of us knows what a dragon is.  

However, by starting with Smaug, I’m getting a little ahead of myself. Although he is the first dragon Tolkien named in his published works, in the chronology of Middle-earth, he is the last of the great dragons. And there’s a long heritage of monsters that preceded him.

So in the annals of Middle-earth the very first dragon - the father of them all - is the *“Great Worm”* Glaurung. And Glaurung’s date of birth (or hatching) is unknown. His master Morgoth intentionally kept his existence a secret until he was ready to be unleashed upon the unsuspecting Elves. But, as I guess is quite common with rebellious young beings, Glaurung was impatient, and he emerged from his master’s dungeons two hundred years before Morgoth was ready to unveil him. 

However Glaurung's official debut came with the disastrous *Battle of Sudden Flame*, which broke the military supremacy of the Noldor and their allies. And Glaurung was the reason for all this sudden flame. I mean the balrgos helped, but the Father of the Dragons led the largest army of orcs and evil things that the world had ever seen, and the ""*Elves and Men withered before him.""* 

But the Battle of Sudden Flame was just a taste of the horror that Glaurung would eventually unleash. Only seventeen years later came the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and this was arguably the greatest loss ever suffered by the Free Peoples in Middle-earth's history. In this battle, Glaurung once again emerged from Morgoth's fortress, but this time he was not the only one of his kind. Tolkien tells us about Glaurung's brood, which he describes as ""*many and terrible"",* and these children of Glaurung caused immense devastation upon the field of battle. 

Now within Middle-earth, not all dragons are created equal, and as is always the case with Tolkien, there are a few different types of dragons throughout the Legendarium. But Glaurung and his brood are among some of the most dangerous, for they are all of the class of *Urulóki* \- known more commonly as fire-drakes. So as the name suggests, Glaurung and his brood were all endowed with the ability to breathe dragon fire. And dragon fire is no ordinary thing. In *The Lord of the Rings* we're told that it's hot enough to melt Rings of Power. The only other place where that could happen is in the fires of Mount Doom. 

But anyway, in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Glaurung and his brood lay waste to the lands of the Sons of Fëanor, and they *""sweep apart""* the two factions of Elven allies. And when that was done, Glaurung went after Lord Azaghâl, the chief of the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains. And although Azaghâl's Dwarven army hewed Glaurung and sent him into a rage, they were unable to kill him. And when the battle was over, Azaghâl was just another slain hero, who'd met his end in the fires Glaurung. 

And there's something really interesting here, because although in the First Age dragons are portrayed as the destroyers of many mighty Elven armies, and in later Ages they're known as the great enemies of the Dwarves, in Tolkien's entire Legendarium we're not told of a single named dragon who is ever killed by either an elf or a dwarf. Every dragon that dies, is slain by a single mortal Man, standing alone in single combat. 

And this brings us the eventual doom of Glaurung. Now I don't want to unnecessarily spoil anything, because I’ll cover this in much greater detail in future Silmarillion videos, but just like with all future dragons, Glaurung is slain by a mortal Man. And there's no battle. There are no armies. There is simply Glaurung and the son of Húrin. But *before* the hero’s black sword pierces Glaurung's belly, Tolkien demonstrates some of the other lesser known powers of Glaurung the Great Worm. Because although the dragon is most famous for his fiery and poisonous breath, he has another power that proves perhaps even more destructive. 

You see Glaurung is a master of minds. Not unlike Sauron, he uses deception against his enemies, but this is not the limit of what he can do. More than once in the Legendarium he uses his power to hypnotise his enemies, and he freezes them in place. Which renders them completely helpless against him. But even this is not his greatest gift. At one point in the story, Glaurung comes across a young maiden and he uses some sort of spell to utterly obliterate her mind. He destroys her memories. And when he's finished with her, the maiden is left with no idea who she is, why she's there, or even what her name is. And just like most of the tales in the *Children of Húrin*, the story ends really badly for said maiden. 

However, eventually Glaurung is slain, and so he becomes the first in a long line of dragons to be killed by Mannish heroes. Over the Ages he would be joined by the ""*Long-worm""* Scatha who was slain by Fram (an ancestor of the Men of Rohan), the Beast of Gondolin who was vanquished by Tuor (the only Man in a city full of Elves), and of course Smaug who is slain not by dwarves or by wizards or by hobbits, but by Bard the Bowman and his Black Arrow. However of all the dragons in Tolkien's Legendarium, there is one who stands out amongst all others. One dragon who is the greatest of his kind, the mightiest of them all, and the ancestor of all future winged dragons. *Ancalagon the Black.*

So the truth is that we don't know a huge amount about Ancalagon, but we do know that Morgoth bred him to be the greatest dragon that ever lived. And he was unleashed in Morgoth's final hour, during the War of Wrath. Now there is a little bit of debate amongst fans in regards to Ancalagon's size. If you google him you'll probably find an image comparing the sizes of all the dragons in Middle-earth, and Ancalagon will no doubt be outrageously huge. And to be fair, Ancalagon was massive. But he probably wasn't *that* massive. I mean we know that he could fly, and even in a fantasy setting, the laws of physics do have a limit. Although again to be fair, we *are* told that when Ancalagon was cast down, his body fell from the sky and broke all three of the tallest mountains in Middle-earth after he landed on top of them. But I would argue this is more due to his power than his size. After all, we're also told that when Gandalf killed the balrog in Lord of the Rings, and cast its body off the peak of Zirakzigil, it broke the mountainside, but this doesn't make the balrog the size of a mountain. 

Anyway, regardless of the question of his size, Ancalagon's might is undeniable. For a moment it looked like he might be powerful enough to drive back the combined strength of the Valar, and Tolkien tells us that Ancalagon led the vanguard of *""the winged dragons, that had not before been seen; and so sudden and ruinous was the onset of that dreadful fleet that the host of the Valar was driven back, for the coming of the dragons was with great thunder, and lightning, and a tempest of fire.""* 

But, as with all others, even Ancalagon was eventually slain. And just like all others, his doom came at the hand of a single individual. *Eärendil the Mariner.* 

Now referring to Eärendil as a mortal Man is a little bit misleading, because technically he's the son of a mortal Man *and* an immortal Elf. In fact he is the only pure 50/50 man elf hybrid in the whole Legendarium (except for Galador and Gilmith who I mentioned in that video about the Half-Elves of Gondor). But for most of his life, Eärendil is counted amongst the race of Men, and just like Fram, Tuor, Bard, and the son of Húrin, he alone takes down Ancalagon, in what must have been one of the most epic battles in Middle-earth's history. 

So with Ancalgon dead, the race of dragons seemed to disappear from the world for a very long time. Throughout the entire Second Age there is absolutely no reference to any living dragon of any kind. But they were not all gone. And in the Third Age, dragons returned to once again plague the Free Peoples of the North. But many of *these* dragons were a bit different. 

So we're told by Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings that the seven Dwarven rings were ""*the foundation of each of the Seven Hoards of the Dwarf-kings of old"",* and it's highly likely that these treasure hoards were what attracted the dragons of the Grey Mountains in the first place. Gandalf tells us that *""the Dragons devoured them, and of the Seven Rings some were consumed in fire.""* 

And in the year 2570 of the Third Age, dragons returned from the *""wastes beyond""* and thus began the great *War of the Dwarves and Dragons.* However as I said, not all of these dragons were like the Urulóki of the First Age. Many of *these* dragons were Cold-drakes known as *Foalóki,* and Tolkien tells us that they ""*are cold as in the nature of snakes and serpents, and of them a many having wings go with the uttermost noise and speed.""* So these dragons can fly but they can’t breathe fire. 

However, the War of the Dwarves and Dragons is not a happy story. For twenty years the Dwarves fought the dragons, and in that time they held their ground in the Grey Mountains, but ultimately, this was not a war the Dwarves could win. Eventually King Dáin I and his son Frór were killed by a Cold-drake outside their very own doors, and this marked the end of the Dwarves' resistance in the Grey Mountains. King Dáin's eldest son and his heir, Thrór (that same Thrór who becomes the grandfather of Thorin Oakenshield) led many of the Dwarven survivors to Erebor, where they rebuilt the great Dwarven Kingdom under the Mountain. And for two hundred years, the Dwarves of Erebor prospered under King Thrór. However the dragons that killed Thrór's father were not gone forever, and in the year 2770 of the Third Age, Thrór would face a terror far greater than the one that killed his father and brother. 

Because of course, 2770 is the year that Smaug the Golden descended from the North *""like a hurricane""*, and sacked Erebor. He killed every guard who came out to challenge him, he destroyed the city of Dale, and for the following 171 years, Smaug slept on his newly acquired pile of gold. Now I reckon we all know the story of Smaug's eventual demise, and I'm not going to explain the entire plot of the Hobbit, but when Bard the Bowman fired that fateful arrow, not only did he kill Smaug, and rescue lake town, and avenge Dale, but he also ended a far greater conflict. He killed the last great dragon of the North, and he finally ended the threat that Morgoth had unleashed with Glaurung at the Battle of Sudden Flame, 6517 years earlier. 

However there is one last thing to say about Smaug. Because although he is the last great dragon of the Legendarium, one could also argue that he also is the last dragon of a far older literary tradition. You see, although I think it's fair to say that Tolkien popularised dragons in the genre of modern fantasy, he did not invent them. Dragons have been a staples of Slavic, Iberian, and Bretonic folklore, and perhaps the most famous tales of dragons and mortal Men (at least in Western European traditions) come from the writings of Tolkien's beloved ancestors, the Anglo-Saxons. 

So between 1920 and 1926, Tolkien jumped head first into the realm of old English literature by translating the epic tale of *Beowulf* into modern English. And of course at the end of the tale, the hero Beowulf (spoiler for a poem that's over 1000 years old) dies slaying a giant fire-breathing dragon. Furthermore in the tale of *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight*, which Tolkien translated in 1920 whilst working as his University's youngest professor, Sir Gawain battles fire-breathing wyrms. And of course, perhaps the most famous Anglo-Saxon tale to feature fire-breathing dragons is the Norse-Germanic *Völsunga Saga,* starring the fire-breathing monster Fafnir and the mortal Man Sigurd. (This is the same Sigurd/Siegfried that Chrsitoph Waltz talks about in Django Unchained, and one of the main characters in Wagner's '*The Ring Cycle'.*) 

Now there are a number of striking similarities between Fafnir and Smaug, as well as between Fafnir and Glaurung. In fact Bilbo's dialogue with Smaug almost perfectly mirrors Sigurd's exchange with Fafnir, and Glaurung's description as a flightless dragon who hoarded gold and breathes poison also mirrors Fafnir perfectly. 

So I guess this means that although dragons have been a part of Western imagination for over a thousand years, and although dragons have become one of the most recognisable elements of modern fantasy, it is Tolkien who tied these two strands together, and popularised dragons as we know them today. Not long ago, I was watching a movie with my nephew and he wanted to put on *How to Train Your Dragon.* And I was immediately struck by the fact that the humans (despite speaking with Sottish accents) all claim they are Vikings. Why is it that even in a 21st Century American children's movie  we associate dragons with old Norse mythology? It's because of Tolkien. It's because Tolkien created the first dragons of the modern era, by adapting the ancient dragons of Europe's historic past. Think about that next time you see a dragon on TV!

So thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on the dragons of Middle-earth, and Tolkien's wider contributions to the fantasy genre. As some of you may know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies.

1635769565.0,Dune was near perfect but I didn't connect emotionally to it - anyone else in the same boat?,"This isn't some hate piece. Whilst in the cinema I understood the film was objectively near perfect in achieving what it set out to do / the tone and mood it set out to evoke. It was stunning to watch and clearly there was a lot of love and respect for the source material.

But I didn't connect emotionally to any of it.

I think it might have been the music. I imagine the brief was 'make the music setup the tone and world building' which it nailed but there were no character motifs and no memorable and emotionally stimulating tracks of any sort (to my ears) such as you get in LOTR, Potter, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Marvel and even Game of Thrones. Even in Thrones when the music was dour, it was connected to a character - think the song about Tywin - or the Stark theme. The music in these IPs is iconic. You can hum them and they are often associated with a character and go on as much as a journey over the films as those characters. Dune had a lot of bombastic sound, but no feeling, at least to me.

Anyone else feel the same or am I just odd?

1700500310.0,I’m tired of Hard Magic Systems,"Hey y’all, I’m in the middle of my LOTR reread for the year and it’s put me back in touch with something I loved about fantasy from the beginning: soft, mysterious magic that doesn’t have an outright explanation/almost scientific break down; magic where some words are muttered and fire leaps from finger tips, where a staff can crack stone in half simply by touching it. I want some vagueness and mystery and high strangeness in my magic. So please, give me your best recommendation for series or stand-alones that have soft magic systems.


Really the only ones I’m familiar with as far as soft would be LOTR, Earthsea and Howl’s Moving Castle.

1605011580.0,"Hi r/Fantasy!!! I'm Evan Winter, author of THE RAGE OF DRAGONS and now THE FIRES OF VENGEANCE (which was released in stores & online just a few hours before I sat down to write this). I'm here on release day because this is exactly where I want to be. Please AMA!","For anyone interested in picking up THE FIRES OF VENGEANCE, you can do that here: [https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/evan-winter/the-fires-of-vengeance/9780316489805/](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/evan-winter/the-fires-of-vengeance/9780316489805/) (North America) or here [https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/titles/evan-winter/the-fires-of-vengeance/9780356512976/](https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/titles/evan-winter/the-fires-of-vengeance/9780356512976/) (UK and other markets), and for anyone interested in talking self-publishing, traditional publishing, writing, fantasy, or anything else, I'll try to set the scene:

\- I initially self-published THE RAGE OF DRAGONS, and because I'd lurked on the subreddit for years, I mentioned it on r/ Fantasy. My biggest hopes at the time were for the post to avoid being removed and for it to catch the attention of a few people who would try the book, besides my mom (here's the motion graphic cover I used: [https://youtu.be/jb3k5NrhMG8?t=20](https://youtu.be/jb3k5NrhMG8?t=20)).

\- Instead, the subreddit supported the book wholeheartedly and that support launched RAGE into the top 250 of all Amazon books that day.

\- That launch gave RAGE a ton of momentum, helping it to stay visible for longer than I would have been able to do on my own.

\- In a right place, right time moment that I'd be embarrassed to put in a movie script, my now editor, Brit Hvide (a brilliant writer), saw the r/ Fantasy post, took the time to read RAGE, figured out a way to get in touch with me, and offered to buy the series.

\- Once the deal was done, Orbit re-released RAGE (Summer 2019), and, given all that followed, it would be very hard for me to be happier with how things have gone.

\- It's been incredible to see the book in stores, libraries (I wrote most of RAGE in a library), and online; I've had the chance to do interviews with wonderful people and media outlets; I've met countless new and amazing people; and, most of all, it's been both humbling and exhilarating to see readers' reactions to the book itself.

\- And, because of you and all the other readers, I found out earlier this week that, more than a year after its Orbit release, THE RAGE OF DRAGONS is getting another hardcover print run.

\- Also because of you and all the other readers, RAGE was in a position to catch the attention of TIME magazine and the panel of judges it put together to develop their TOP 100 FANTASY BOOKS OF ALL TIME list.

So, in something of a summary, it's been an unbelievable ride, and at the moment, the only tangible thing I have to offer for such a life-changing couple of years are the 500 or so pages in THE FIRES OF VENGEANCE.

To anyone who gives those pages a try, I sincerely hope you find them worthy.",Fantasy

1564099851.0,"If you liked Avatar: The Last Airbender, please consider watching The Dragon Prince","If you liked A:TLA, the Dragon Prince has the same head writer. The show has two seasons out on Netflix already but it's definitely not as well known, which is hugely disappointing. Netflix hasn't been that big on the marketing front. The main premise deals with an ancient conflict between Humans and Elves which has been ongoing ever since Humans were kicked out of the magical land of Xadia for performing dark magic. However, as details of the conflict - recent and ancient - are slowly revealed, it turns out things are far more nuanced than they seem with both sides responsible for terrible actions. And though dark magic and its users have been consistently seen as evil, it's also not so black and white and has been used to save thousands of lives. 

If you liked the visuals in A:TLA, the visuals of the Dragon Prince are equally stunning with some really cool character designs. It also has a lot of pleasant diversity in characters along the POC and LGBT spectrums. Admittedly the animation is a little clunky in the first season but VASTLY improves in the second.

Here's the trailer for the first season:

1613010413.0,The Lies of Locke Lamora is absoloutely BRILLIANT. Thank you for recommending it to me.,"Locke Lamora has been recommended to me for so long and I finally got around to reading it. It was incredible, and as good if not better than what everyone on this subreddit made it out to be. Thank you Scott Lynch. It's moving right towards the top of my recommendations now. If you liked GRRM's characters, wit, prose, plot twists, and writing style, you'll probably also love this. For the uninitiated, I'd describe this as a cross between A Song of Ice and Fire and Ocean's 11, but only until the third act. 

I've been (fairly) chriticized in the past for praising books without giving specifics about why I liked it so much, so I'll try not to repeat that here. The following is everything I can remember enjoying (and that can be put in words), in no particular order.

First, the non-linear story telling, even intra-chapter, was fascinating, and set up some incredible twists and payoffs. One example is when we see >!Midnighters visit Don Salvara and reveal Locke's entire game, and then in the next portion of the chapter find out that that was really Locke.!< Truly made for a unique and refreshing read. 

Second, the characters. What's there not to like? The Spider, the Thorn, the gray king, Hell, even Don Salvara, they were all well flushed out characters with interesting back stories that played a role in the plot and explaining their motivations. Their intelligence and humor were of the kind that make me marvel that anyone can write them as well as Lynch does. 

Third, the fucking prose. Holy hell. The imagery and the descriptions, especially those delicious short interludes, which I typically find annoying. So, so pleasurable to read. So vivid, so beautiful. As is probably obvious, my own prose is lacking, as I can't even desribe adequately how amazing Lynch's prose was. Instead of trying to describe it, I'll just offer the following examples from Part 2 of the Prologue, on page 3, which don't include any spoilers:

""On the night the Lamora boy had come to live under the Thiefmaker's care, the old graveyard on Shades' Hill had been full of children,  standing at silent attention and waiting for their new brothers and sisters to be led down into the mausoleums.

""The Thiefmaker's wards all carried candles; their cold blue light shone through the silver curtains of river mist as streetlamps might glimmer through a smoke-grimed window. A chain of ghostlight wound its way down from the hilltop, through the stone markers and ceremonial paths, down to the wide glass bridge over the Coalsmoke Canal, half-visible in the blood-warm fog that seeps up from Camorr's wet bones on summer nights.""

Again, this is just one, early example. The book is stuffed with this kind of prose, and personally I find it so, so pleasurable to read.

Fourth, the plot twists and expectation subversions. Specifically, >!the early deaths of the Barsavis (especially Nazca) and Calo, Galdo, and Bug.!< Gave me real >!Red Wedding!< vibes, and were definitely heart-wrenching. Don't get me wrong, GRRM is still a different level, but this is the closest I've seen anyone come to it (in his style, at least).

Fifth, the humor. The book is chalk full of it, given the nature of Locke's profession, but one specific example that comes to mind is when Locke ran into >!Meraggio at Raven's Reach while wearing the clothes he stole off his very back.!< What's there not to love about that scene lmao.

Sixth, the world-building. Lynch manages to keep the story intimate and easy to follow while still building a complex, rich, and engaging world, especially through the use of his aforementioned beautiful interludes. I don't think I've ever been able to say this about a book before, but there wasn't a single instance of info-dumping (there was some of that in this book) that I didn't enjoy reading. 

Seventh, the pacing. Especially given the plot, you never go too long without some action, but to be honest even the scenes of the Gentlemen Bastards just having dinner are enjoyable to read, given their witty banter. 

Eigth, the payoffs. Call me basic, but >!I like seeing the good guys win.!< Watching >!the Falconer get tortured!< was very satisfying. And lmao love how >!Locke got the Salvaras and the Spider to dig through barges of shit looking for their money.!<

Of course, the book isn't without flaws. One thing that stuck out to me was how for a significant portion of the book following >!the murders of Calo, Galdo, and Bug,!< Locke just goes about business as usual. Lol we have a whole chapter dedicated to Locke >!stealing clothes!< just pages after this happens. Just seemed odd, but maybe that's consistent with Locke's character; I'll have to think about it.  

I cannot wait to jump into books 2 and 3, and hope the rest of the books (7 planned) don't take too long to come out. I understand most people think the series never reaches the heights of book 1 again, but I just can't wait to get some more of Locke and Jean and Lynch's prose and plots. 

PS: who the fuck is >!Sabetha.!< (Don't actually tell me, I don't want spoilers.",Fantasy
1710339086.0,I just read The Hobbit for the first time and I’m floored,"I thought I was diving into a fun story about going on an epic adventure to defeat the big bad dragon. And that’s exactly what I got for the first 80% of the book! Tolkien’s narration was so cozy, full of humour, and I felt like he was my grandpa telling me this awesome story. Bilbo's journey and transformation into an adventure leader was inspiring. What was there not to love? 

So imagine my confusion and disappointment to see Smaug was dealt with in four pages. One single arrow and done. Not to mention, the dwarves and Bilbo were nowhere in sight! Where was my epic battle? Where was everyone uniting and fighting against the terrible monster and coming out victorious? Worst of all, now we’re following this Bard guy we had never even heard of and they’re discussing “politics”. What the hell?

But I continued reading and my heart dropped when I understood where this was going. How gut wrenching it was to see the people we had been journeying with, the dwarves and specially Thorin, pretty much take the place of Smaug. Ready to enact violence because of his greed and turn on the people who had helped him (although everyone was a bit greedy, I’d say Bard had a pretty reasonable claim and approach to it). And then things keep escalating, more dwarves are coming and a war seems inevitable. I, who previously was disappointed by the lack of an epic battle, was now thinking “Please, let there be no battle”.

Even if at the nick of time they came together to fight against the goblins, it did nothing to lighten the heaviness in my stomach. The fact that they had all come so close to killing each other was depressing enough. Knowing that Tolkien lived through war made it hit all the harder. Things worked out fine in the end, but there was none of that huge victory, or “yay” feeling at defeating the enemy. As there shouldn’t be because wars aren’t like that, but I thought this was going to be more of a light hearted children’s story and didn’t think it’d hit this hard. I severely underestimated The Hobbit it seems.

Suffice it to say that The Hobbit will sit with me for a long long time, and I’m both looking forward to and terrified of reading LOTR now. ",Fantasy
1669046839.0,How do you feel when books make up fake swear words?,"I'm about halfway through Foundryside and absolutely loving it. But everyone says ""scrum"" or ""scrumming"" every other word and it makes me die a little bit inside every time haha. The author says what the etymology of the word is (extremely minor spoilers: >!sailor slang for anal sex!<), which is nice, but I would still much rather everyone just say fuck. The characters say other real swears like ""shit"" -- even irl religion based ones like ""hell"" and ""damn"" (""Holy hell, that's scrumming awful"" being the phrase that inspired this post lmao) -- so why come up with a replacement just for ""fuck""?? The book is full of sex and gore so it's not like it's trying to be appropriate for teenagers or anything.

I don't mind fake swears in YA, if the characters are supposed to be more high-class and prissy, or if the fake swears are used alongside real ones to denote class/culture/etc.. I'm actively in favor of replacing things like ""hell"" or ""damn"" if they don't make sense within the world's religion(s). But most of the time I think dancing around irl swear words just makes all the characters sound like little kids in a 50s TV show going ""oh golly gee"".",Fantasy

Speaking for me, I don't want to see all the CGI spren (Stormlight Archive) every 5 seconds next to live actors. Its too much, and expensive besides. 

Anime though. You can super stylize it and make it look incredible, like The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf on Netflix. That is both one of my favorite fantasy adaptations and one of my favorite anime movies all in one. It looks incredible, as good animes do, and it has the backing of great writing, as the fantasy novels that we love obviously do.

Imagine entering a warren in Malazan looking like a  Jujutsu Kaisen Domain Expansion. This would be everything for me. Then they studios throw a budget at the adaptors and marketing team to keep the episodes coming at a consistent pace, unlike many of my favorite animes. I think it could work.

1594496291.0,What Books r/fantasy Recommends (statistical analysis of 2000+ comments in June),"Last month there was a discussion of recommendations on r/fantasy and the daily recommendations thread. More people began using the daily thread (for a while at least) and I was intrigued by what the data might show. So I began recording things... and then the world caught on fire. Honestly I kind of regret undertaking this but I'm deep in the grip of the sunk cost fallacy now and this thread is my effort to justify all the time I put into this. Hopefully it's of interest to somebody!

# Methodology

I recorded two data sets: recommendations in the daily threads and recommendations to individual requests. For the daily thread I simply recorded every single one (coincidentally 775). Doing all the other threads would have wrecked my life so I tried to choose a neutral sampling method: if I selected a day I had to record EVERY recommendation thread for the entire day. My goal was to remove my own selection bias so that I wouldn't accidentally represent only one type of thread. (Or choose smaller threads that wouldn't kill my fingers. :P)

In the end I only managed to do five days (mix of weekdays and weekends) and that still came out to 1165 recommendations total. I think this is enough to be at least a somewhat representative sample. There are always exceptions and outliers but hopefully they somewhat balance out.

To avoid impacting the data myself I didn't participate in recommending things (except a few times 24+ hours later that I didn't record). Not participating also has a small impact but I don't think I'm a significant enough part of either sample for this to meaningfully skew the data.

I've tried to focus on objective data and averages that could be calculated automatically by spreadsheet. In some cases I had to do work by hand and I may have introduced minor errors. When I make statements that are based on my impressions but not statistically based I'll mention it.

# Grand Total

This post is going to focus on the books and authors that are recommended most frequently but to ignore all the others would be to dismiss all the other recommending that goes on here. So we'll begin with a big statistic:

~~In my sample~~ r/fantasy ~~recommended 1793 different books and 1831 different authors!~~

(The above numbers were determined by filtering the total book/author lists but commenters below pointed out problems with addition. That suggests that these totals were probably inflated by duplicates that weren't filtered. I still want to celebrate all the unique recommendations with the total unique fields below!)

It might seem illogical for the number of authors to be higher but there were many recommendations that suggested an author in general without listing a specific book. Since this tended to happen more often with less referenced authors (just my impression) this added up. This is also the reason my data below focuses more on authors than on specific books.

# Daily Thread Overview

Over the course of the month 214 users made 232 top level comments in the daily threads (on average 7.73/day). One surprise for me was just how many small questions there were: 46.6% of all base posts! I always thought of it as the recommendations thread but the ""small questions"" side is clearly important.

Of all the questions or requests 21 of them (9.5%) went unanswered after 48 hours. Some were pretty obscure questions but there were also some missed recommendation requests. Impression: these were very likely to be asked toward the end of the day so I strongly advise people to post or repost requests in the morning (USA time) when there's the most activity.

There were 11 times (4.7%) when someone used the thread to recommend something even though that's not in the thread description. There's nothing wrong with this but I suspect those people might get more reactions by promoting their favorites in a general thread.

I haven't parsed this data into types but there were 214 users starting comment chains and 171 users participating in them. There's some overlap and the second number misses some participants in general non-recommendation discussion.

Anyway that was just because I collected that data. From now on we'll consider only the 117 recommendation requests.

&#x200B;

# Daily Threads Top Authors

The following table is counting every recommendation of every author over the course of the month in the daily threads. Explicitly saying you second a recommendation wasn't counted. Asking ""Do I read X or Y?"" wasn't counted.

The average request received 3.27 responders giving 6.62 total recommendations. The average per person (2.02) is deceptive due to the occasional high volume comment: the mode was definitely 1 and I think the median is 1 as well. The most active request got 17 people giving 53 suggestions!

# ULTRA IMPORTANT STATISTICS

While doing all this I scanned the lists alphabetically to eliminate typos or name discrepancies. In the process I discovered the following critical facts:

* The most common male first name was Robert (13).
* The most common female first name was Sarah (10).
* The most common first word in a title was ""Blood"" or a derivative (8).

With this essential service rendered we may now carry on.

# Combined Top Authors

These two data sets are different but they are both part of r/fantasy so I think combining them is at least a little worthwhile. This list updates the totals of authors who ranked on one list but not on the other.

There were two authors exclusive to one set: Robert Jackson Bennett was recommended 14 times in the daily threads but never in the general threads. Robert Jordan had 11 in the general threads but none in the daily threads. Every other commonly mentioned author appeared at least once in the other set.

The above lists all include repeat recommendations in the same thread. Due to certain outlier threads where one book/author was an obvious choice and multiple people chimed in to suggest them this makes a difference. Below is a list of the NUMBER OF REQUESTS to which the author was suggested. So if an author was mentioned seven times in response to one question that only counts as one.

Mostly I've avoided analyzing user data because it feels a bit invasive. But many many users requested that I record the number of unique accounts for each author or measure what percentage of recommendations are the same people. I did this for all the top authors and that is my limit.

An author recommended only by a single user has a repeat percentage near 100% (but 100% is impossible because the first mention is never a repeat). If an author was mentioned by a new person each time they came up then it would be 0%. The formula is just (total - unique) / total.

# Most Common Books/Series

Though author data was generally more reliable, since I gathered all that data about specific titles I figure I should do something with it. Here are the most recommended individual books or series. This creates some new wrinkles: since I reduced every Discworld book to just ""Discworld"" in the dataset they come off as more monotonous than they really were. My gut feeling is that about half of them were specific book recommendations.

# Books/Series + More Data

I asked people what data they wanted to see and several upvoted comments asked me to put the top titles alongside other data. So I reproduced the top books/series list and added several other data points:

* Rank refers to how popular it was in the r/fantasy [""Top Novels"" poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/c7d7z8/the_rfantasy_2019_top_novels_poll_results/).
* Goodreads ratings is how many people left ratings on Goodreads (highest book for series). This can often be used as a rough proxy for how many readers a series has overall.
* Publication date is exactly what it sounds like (publication of the first book for series). This is interesting on its own and potentially relevant to interpreting ratings.

I didn't include the average Goodreads rating because while I think this can be interesting data it's not that useful as a point of comparison.

|BOOK/SERIES|RECCS|RANK|GR RATINGS|PUB DATE|

|Discworld|28|10|306,000|1983|
|Curse of Chalion|25|49|31,500|2001|

# Author Demographics

With such a huge number of authors it simply wasn't possible for me to determine this data for everyone so I'll first restrict my calculations to the top 25 authors. The numbers are as follows:

* 52% female, 48% male, 0% nonbinary/team
* 76% Americans, 12% British, 8% Canadians, 4% New Zealanders
* 96% white, 4% black (Octavia Butler)

People in the daily thread (especially oboist73!) helped me expand this list. I now give the same data for the top 84 authors (everyone who received 5 or more recommendations). It is possible that there are some authors lowish in both sets that should have scraped onto this list but this set still accounts for 834 reccs.

* 42 women, 41 men, 1 nonbinary
* 76 white, 5 Black, 3 Asian
* 66 Americans, 12 Brits, 4 Canadians, 1 New Zealander, 1 Singaporan
* It's hard to know orientation for sure but the vast majority seem to be straight. I could only confirm 3 who were otherwise: one pansexual/demisexual woman, one gay man, one bisexual woman.

I could render those as percentages but they're basically what you would expect from eyeballing the numbers. Calculating percentages of total recommendations also didn't generally move the numbers all that much.

ADDED BY POPULAR REQUEST

I made an effort to determine gender of all unique authors in the two sets because people requested it. Counting by hand is inherently limited and there could be some errors (especially with nonbinary folks). If someone is nonbinary with a gendered name (and isn't Sarah Gailey or someone I know) then they were miscounted. If someone was named James they got counted as male unless they were Jame Tiptree Jr. I did look up all initial authors, those from languages I didn't know, or ambiguous names.

Daily Threads:

* 186 men (52%)
* 159 women (45%)
* 3 NB (\~1%)
* 3 team (\~1%)
* 4 unknown (\~1%)

General Threads:

* 236 men (48%)
* 241 women (49%)
* 4 NB (\~1%)
* 4 team (\~1%)
* 6 unknown (\~1%)

I'm afraid I don't have it in me to balance all those by the number of votes since this has already taken a long time. The differences in the most recommended authors would have an influence here but I don't want to make assumptions about the authors down the list.

# My Soapbox

Now I'm going to get up on my soapbox and declare the following: I am super tired. I have tried my best to gather interesting data in a neutral fashion. I hope it's useful to someone.

I do think some of these results run contrary to conventional wisdom on this sub but I'm already worried enough about the reaction. If I've taken anything personally out of this it's that feeling guilty for recommending my favorites a couple times a month was silly.

I will do my best to update this post if people are interested in more data. If there's something that can be calculated automatically I'm happy to add it! If it requires some more manual counting... that's less likely. For example: if you're curious about a favorite author not listed it would be very easy to check them.",Fantasy

1638503656.0,When the whole is or is not greater than the sum of its parts. My thoughts after finishing both Malazan and Wheel of Time in the last few months.,"Let me preface this by saying this is not another ""Have you tried Malazan? You should try Malazan! ... Malazan!"" post. 

This is a spoiler-free discussion on my perception, while reading and after finishing, the series' Malazan Book of the Fallen (MBotF) by Steven Erikson and The Wheel of Time (WoT) by Robert Jordan (and Brandon Sanderson). This is not a book review or critique.

I read through MBotF and WoT over the last 2 years for the first time. I read them in rotation along with another random trilogy or series mixed in as I went. I don't like to read 2 books from the same series back to back because they tend to blur together in my mind. I want each book in a series to have its own isolated moment in my mind and have time to digest before I dive in to more from the same series.  Anyways, I started  Gardens of the Moon (MBotF 1)and followed it up with Eye of the World (Wot 1). 

I finished The Crippled God (MBotF 10) about 6 months ago, and just recently A Memory of Light (Wot 14). I first came across the concept of a ""series hangover"" while reading some discussion on MBotF. A series hangover (or whatever you want to call it) is a difficulty moving on after finishing a series. Some people have the urge to immediately restart the series or will have trouble starting another. I read multiple statements of people being so affected by the end of Malazan that they were unable to pick up another book for 3 months. I, however, didn't experience this when finishing the Malazan series. I simply took a day off as usual then picked up Crossroads of Twilight (WoT 10) and went right on.  Don't get me wrong, it was an outstanding series with an epic finale like you would expect from Erikson but it didn't leave me lost or feeling like something was missing. Fast forward to a week ago, I finished WoT and wanted nothing more than to pick Eye of the World back up and start over as well as rewatch every episode of the show over and over. 

So, if anyone has read my ramblings this far you're probably thinking ""ok, so? You liked WoT more than MBotF, it's not that big of a deal."" This is where my stupid title comes in (sorry I'm not that clever). Aristotle is credited with the term ""the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts."" If you were to lay down any MBotF book next to any WoT book (with probably the exception of A Memory of Light) and ask which book is better I would  point to the MBotF book every time. Despite that, right now looking back, I have to say **WoT is a better series than MBotF.  Despite the individual Malazan books being better than the individual WoT books.**

Each MBotF entry is an adventure all to itself. The characters are larger than life badasses, the battles are grand, and the climaxes are earth shaking. Each book is a smash hit, but multiple books start over with ne wcharacters and new locations. As opposed to being a 10 book series, it's almost 3 trilogies in the same world that masterfully mix together and converge in a grand finale. Conversely, WoT is a slow grind.  It's 14 books following a main character, their few friends and lovers, and a few ancillary characters and antagonists that help drive the plot.  Some of the middle books are so slow they are referred to as the slog. The great part is it all builds and builds and pays off epically in the end.  Every plot, subplot,  twist,  setback, and seemingly arbitrary conversation plays a role in the expert character growth and development that sets this series apart. By the end I felt like I had watched about 7 different people grow up and then change the world. 

I don't know if there is much of a point to this wall of text, but I've had these books on my mind the last few days. I just find it interesting that I loved each MBotF book so much, and while in the middle of the series' would've said without hesitation that it was the superior saga. Despite this, I look back and definitely feel a bigger connection and love for WoT, as a whole. 

I'm interested to see what others who have read both series think. Also interested in other really long series recommendations. Thanks r/fantasy for reading, have a good one.

1637773176.0,“It’s strange that people want violence but not sex in fantasy” — a response,"I often see this point floated around in discussions about sex in fiction and how people are hypocritical for sometimes wanting the most brutal violence on the page but not wanting even for a moment any sex between their characters. While I do think fantasy should have more sex, this is kind of an unfair argument to me that falsely equates these two things.

The thing about violence in fantasy is that it is a staple. People often pick up fantasy to read about magic fights or dragon battles or whatnot. I know going into a Brandon Sanderson book that I’m probably gonna get a cool magic system that is exploited to kill people. Similarly if you pick up something grimdark you are probably gonna get some more brutal violence, and you will probably EXPECT that. 

While I primarily read for character dynamics and I’m sure few read exclusively for violence, the fact remains that part of why many of us read fantasy is for this kinda thing. I want to see how a 14 year old girl uses bread magic to beat up bad guys. I want to see how those who wear bioenergetic Jade beat the shit out of those who don’t. End of the day, this is a genre expectation of fantasy. Not all fantasy has violence, true, and I do enjoy reading those (Piranesi is amazing) but end of the day this is a fair genre expectation, whereas sex is not something we typically expect in fantasy.

As a result it’s a little strange to me that we are critical of people wanting violence but not sex in fantasy. We pick up fantasy often for experiences that we cannot have ourselves, but most people (who are not asexual) will have sex, most people will not get a chance to slaughter ten enemies on a tower top with a sword, or ride a dragon into battle and burn down an army. The fact that authors don’t put sex in their fantasy works often to me has nothing to do with shying away from intimacy (although this might be true in certain cases) but more to do with wanting to strengthen the fantasy the book is trying to create for the reader. 

It’s like how on the flip side, a contemporary romance author might not include brutal gratuitous violence in their book, because they are concerned more with different things from fantasy authors. Romance books are almost a different kind of fantasy from fantasy books, so an increased focus on sex and intimacy in those supporting the romance fantasy is analogous to mute fantasy fantasy of violent magical battles.

So, I don’t know, I want more sex in fantasy books personally but I don’t think that it is on the same level of violence in fantasy at all, and I wanted to point out why this argument bothers me.",Fantasy

The wrap comes a full year behind schedule, with shooting of the series repeatedly disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.

Amazon have not officially confirmed the news as yet, but multiple crew members have marked the completion of shooting with social media posts.

They can't rest easy for too long, however, as production is rolling straight into Season 2. The cast and crew are still in Prague (with Lan [reportedly stealing](https://www.instagram.com/p/COLXAGuHfgo/) Moiraine's Golden Globe Award a few days back), and casting and pre-production on the second year is already in full swing. Whether actual shooting will continue immediately into the second season or there'll be a short break is unclear.

Shooting for the bulk of the first season was completed back in November 2020, with just a few last scenes being needed to complete the season. VFX, music scoring and post-production have continued through the pandemic, meaning that it hopefully will not take long to integrate the newly-completed scenes into the finished episodes.

1623233679.0,Brandon Sanderson: A Competent Man,"I know that this sub is inundated with discussions of Sanderson, more so than any other big ticket author, so bear with me on this, because I hope it's slightly different to the usual merry-go-round of whether he is over/underrated, which spirals off into endless sub-beefs and then a meta post about how we should all shut up about Brandon Sanderson and stickied mod comment reminding everyone to play nice^(4). If you finish this and still think I should shut up about Brandon Sanderson, well, I won't hold it against you.

What I want to argue is not whether Sanderson is a good or a bad author, but that he is an astoundingly competent one who is exactly as good as he needs to be, and no more.

**Damned With Faint Praise**

If this sounds like a criticism, I suppose it is. I don't think he is a great prose stylist, but neither do I think he's a bad one. I don't think his characters are searing originals, but I don't think they're stereotypes either. I don't think there are many things that he does badly, and some things he does very well. What I think makes him remarkable as a fantasy author, more so than any other I can think of (possibly in history), is his consistency^(2).

In between 2005 and 2020, Sanderson published twelve full length novels. These were not short novels. Oathbringer, the longest to date, tops out at 454,768 words. If Brandon Sanderson's collected works fell on you from a shelf, you would be feeling it for a while. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/brandonsanderson/comments/cncrea/word_count_of_brandon_sandersons_books/) post puts his overall tally in this period at around 5 million words. That is a lot of words.

Here's the remarkable thing about this chunk of books that he's turned out in about 15 years: *there isn't a single bad one*^(1). There are some small fluctuations. I like some more than others. Some are weaker than others. But it increasingly seems like he is incapable of writing anything which dips below a particular standard. He is the king of 7/10, and it has made him famous.

**Writing A Book Is Hard**

I'll let you take a moment to recover from that bombshell.

Writing a book is hard. Being good at writing is only the start. The world is full of people who can write beautifully, whose characters are vivid and real, whose worlds are constructed with depth and sensitivity. They work in libraries and factories and coffee shops. You might be one of these people. They aren't published, because writing a book is hard. Writing a book is hard because a book is more than the sum of its prose and its characters and its setting. It is the pulling together of hundreds of disparate threads into a coherent whole. It is a story which has to be fast when it needs to be fast, and slow when it needs to be slow. Characters must change and grow at the right times. It must be thematically and tonally consistent. It must grip. This is why finishing a book is only half the battle, because then it's time to hack it into a good *story.* Sharpen your cutting scissors.

Writing a book is hard.

Writing a book is hard unless you're Brandon Sanderson.

I think a good way to think about these features is the micro vs the macro. The micro is the zoomed in storytelling. The description, the dialogue, the action. These aren't easy or trivial things to get right. They are the foundation of the story. If you can't write, you can't write. These are the things that Brandon Sanderson is adequate at. Maybe even good! But they aren't the reason he is successful, and they aren't the reason he is special.

Brandon Sanderson is the master of the macro. The top down view. The man seems to understand the construction of a series and a story and a world like no-one else^(3). This is why I think his worldbuilding is one area of writing where he really does stand out, because he has such a finely attuned sense of the big picture. He is systematic. He *teaches* how to construct magic systems. We all know his rules of magic. They're good because they work.

**Do Androids Dream Of Electric Axehounds?**

He feels to me sometimes like a machine designed by publishers. Plug him in and let him turn out an endless stream of solid, popular books, all of which relate to a huge, ambitious overarching plot. Which other author can have written this many Cosmere books and say they are only a third of the way through their grand plan? Who could believe they could finish such an undertaking? People write more slowly, or they get bogged down in the weeds when the plot gets too big, or the world cannot take the strain placed on it. Rothfuss books come round about as often as Halley's Comet. GRRM is never going to finish Game of Thrones. Brandon Sanderson is going to die having written enough books to build an Iron Throne from them. And the reason for that is because he is achingly competent. He understands story in the way that a script editor or a showrunner understands story, as a set of pieces to arrange in the right order for the maximum effect. The pieces themselves might be unremarkable - these are the micro features - but what's the point of having beautiful puzzle pieces if you never put together the puzzle?

I don't mean to put him down (though I'm sure someone will say I am). I think what he does is remarkable and maybe unprecedented. There is a degree to which he is alive at the right time to ride the wave of popular fantasy. But I really think it is an extraordinary feat to continue to write at the pace and precision that he does. He is building an empire.

Now I can't claim to have any insight into his head. I'm not sure if he would be offended by this characterisation or not. But I think it's a useful way to think about him and his virtues. Because the thing is, it's only his ability to write so quickly and consistently which is allowing him such ambition. There is no danger of scope creep with Sanderson. His scope has always been so wide that he can see the curvature of the earth. His universe travelling characters have been there from the start. His plans to synthesise multiple magic systems. What he is doing would not be possible for any other author, I don't think.

Sometimes I wonder whether you can sense a little urgency in his writing because he wants to finish it, this grand edifice. Fifteen, twenty million words. Multiple sequences. A whole universe, a total theory of magic and matter. Maybe even he senses how absurd a task it is, and knows he can't ever slow down.

Is Brandon Sanderson a good writer or a bad one? My answer is that you're asking the wrong kind of question. Brandon Sanderson is a cyborg, and he's coming for you.

Okay, I think that's long enough! Have a nice day and keep it cool in the comments.

^(2) *Okay I shouldn't have used the word 'unprecedented' here, let's just say it's highly unusual, though I think other writers who have written as prolifically haven't done so as successfully and as consistently, and I think there's a reason for that.*

1611943441.0,What Colour is Legolas' Hair?,"Close your eyes and picture the character of Legolas. Not Orlando Bloom. Legolas. Now, without overthinking your choice, answer this question. What colour is Legolas’s hair? The good news is that whatever answer your mind’s eye conjured, you’re right. There are no wrong answers here (well except maybe pink). You see despite the fact that Legolas is far from an insignificant character *The Lord of the Rings*, JRR Tolkien kept almost everything about him a mystery. We don’t know how old he is, or who his mother was, or even what colour his hair is. And so all we can do is speculate and draw our own conclusions. However this seemingly trivial question about a supporting character’s hair colour, in fact opens up a much wider question about the nature of the Woodland Elves, their mysterious history in Middle-earth, and even the characteristics of their political and cultural identities. Well, at least to an extent.  

So I feel that most people when imagining Legolas’s hair colour, will fall into one of two camps: gold and dark. Now if you imagined something else like silver or brown, that’s all good too, like I said there are no wrong answers, but when it comes to what Tolkien actually wrote, there really are only two points of reference. One for dark. And one for gold. So when Legolas is first introduced in *The Fellowship of the Ring* we’re told nothing more than that he was *“a strange Elf clad in green and brown.”* However a few chapters later Tolkien does tells us “*his head was dark.”* Now on the one hand this may seem fairly cut and dry. Legolas has dark hair, what more is there to say? But it should be noted that within the context of this scene, Legolas is being described at night, and so the jury’s still out on whether the darkness refers to the pigment of his hair, or simply the night-time’s shadows. Now the only other reference that the Professor gave us on this topic, can be found in *The Hobbit*, where the Elvenking of Mirkwood is described as wearing *“a crown of leaves upon his golden hair”.* Now eighteen years later, this Elvenking was of course revealed to be Thranduil, the father of Legolas, so it stands to reason that Legolas may have inherited his father’s hair colour, and thus his hair is golden. But again, this should be taken with a pinch of salt. Because (despite what the movies tell us) Legolas does not appear in the Hobbit, and when Tolkien wrote it in the 1930s, neither Legolas nor the Fellowship existed in his mind. So like I said, there are no wrong answers. 

And at the end of the day, this debate really isn’t a big deal either way. I guess we’re all free to imagine Legolas’s hair in whatever way we choose. But, I do think there’s more to this question than simple aesthetics. Because ultimately, what we’re really debating here isn’t what a supporting character looks like, but the nature of the Wood-elves themselves. 

So when we talk about Wood-elves in Middle-earth, we’re not really talking about one independent clan of elves. Instead we’re talking about two. You see the Woodland realm of Mirkwood (formerly known as the Greenwood) is populated entirely by Dark Elves, but not all Dark Elves are the same. On the one hand there are the *Silvan Elves,* who are reclusive, forest-dwelling folk that pretty neatly fit into our preconceived ideas of what a Wood-elf might look like. But on the other hand, there are the *Sindar Elves,* and they’re a bit different. (By the way, unlike in a lot of other fantasy worlds, in Tolkien's works the term Dark Elf has nothing to do with evil elves. It simply refers to the elves who have *not* been ennobled by the light of the West. 

So way back in the First Age, the only elves in the Woodland Realm were the native *Silvan.* And these guys lived simple and scattered lives amongst the trees. Now, although Tolkien is famous for creating a ton of new languages, the word Silvan was not actually invented him. Instead Silvan, or Sylvan, first entered our language through the Roman god Silvānus, who happened to be the god of woodland, forests, and uncultivated wilderness. So although Silvan is the word that Tolkien most commonly used to describe these woodland elves, their actual name in the Elvish language is *Tawarwaith,* which means wood people. And the Silvan were given this name by their cultural cousins, the *Sindar*.  

Now the Sindar were not originally inhabitants of the Greenwood. Back in the First Age they were known as the Grey Elves of Beleriand, and they fought alongside the Noldor from the West, in the wars against Morgoth. But to be honest, the Sindar and the Noldor had a rather rocky relationship, and once Morgoth was defeated and the Second Age began, their common enemy was no more. However unfortunately for the surviving Sindar, both their kingdom and their king were also gone, and they mostly lived as refugees in the new kingdom of the Noldor. And understandably, they were somewhat reluctant to recognise the Noldor’s king as *their* new monarch. So, a pair of Sindar princes called Amdir and Oropher decided to journey east, and to build two new Sindar kingdoms of their own. 

After crossing the Misty Mountains, Amdir journeyed south and he came to the lands of Lothlórien. There he established a new kingdom, and he became the Sindar king of a predominantly Silvan population. Oropher on the other hand went north, and there he founded his own kingdom in the Greenwood. And just like with Amdir in Lothlórien, Oropher became the new king of the princeless Silvan. Now this means that in both of the woodland realms, we have a large population of “*less wise but more dangerous”* Silvan elves, being governed by a smaller but much more elite ruling class of Sindar elves. 

And this Sindar/Silvan distinction brings us all the way back to our original question. What colour is Legolas’s hair? 

You see Oropher’s great claim to fame, apart from being the fool who got two thirds of his army killed in the War of the Last Alliance, is that he is the grandfather of Legolas. Which means that despite Legolas’s appearance being very much in keeping with that of a Wood-elf’s, *“a strange Elf clad in green and brown”,* we know that Legolas has at least some Sindar heritage. What we don’t know is how much.

And this is because Tolkien tells us absolutely nothing about the women in Legolas’s family. We know that his grandfather was a prince of the Sindar, but who was his grandmother? Who was his mother? To answer this question there’s nowhere we go but deep down the rabbit hole of educated speculation. 

So the identity of Oropher’s wife is completely unknown to us. And the identity of Thranduil’s wife is also completely unknown. *And* the identity of Amdir’s wife is completely unknown to us. But what we do know, is that Amdir’s son Amroth fell in love with an Elf-maiden called Nimrodel. And unlike Oropher, Amdir, and Amroth, Nimrodel was not one of the Sindar elites. Instead she was a native Silvan. Now it’s a bit of a stretch to presume that Sindar princes intermarrying with Silvan women was the norm just because there’s one example of it, but to be fair it is the only example that we have. And furthermore, in the *Unfinished Tales* Tolkien tells us *“Oropher had come* \[to the Greenwood\] *with only a handful of Sindar, and they were soon merged with the Silvan Elves, adopting their language and taking names of Silvan form* *and style…They wished indeed to become Silvan folk and to return, as they said, to the simple life.”* 

Now I do need to point out that when Oropher first came to the Greenwood, his son Thranduil had already been born, which makes it clear that Thranduil's mother was not a Silvan of the Greenwood. But she may very well have been one of the Laiquendi, the Green-elves of Beleriand, who are cultural descendants of the Silvan that just happened to journey west. Anyway after a disastrous battle during the First Age, the Laiquendi came to dwell in the same kingdom as Oropher's Sindar people, so perhaps Thranduil's mother was one of them. Or not, we just don't know.  But the idea of Oropher marrying a woman of the Laiquendi is further supported by Tolkien’s description of Thranduil’s hair. 

Okay, so before I go too deep into this whole hair colour issue, I should point out that this is not an exact science. Both the Sindar and the Silvan were originally descended from the clan known as the Teleri, so it’s not impossible that a Sinda and Silvan could both share the same hair colour. However, throughout the Legendarium we’re introduced to loads of Sindar Elves and almost all the ones who get a description have either dark or silver hair. Not one of them (with the possible exception of Thranduil) is ever described as blonde. Now, on the other hand there is only one Silvan character in the entire Legendarium whose hair colour is explicitly given, and he is an unnamed friend of Haldir’s who we meet in Lothlórien. And Tolkien tells us this guy’s hair *”glinted like gold in the sun”.* Furthermore there is an implication that Amroth’s Silvan lover Nimrodel also had golden hair, as it’s compared to sunlight *“upon the golden boughs”.* But this is admittedly a little more open to interpretation, so I guess we can put Nimrodel in the maybe pile. 

Anyway from our admittedly limited samples we may presume that black, grey, and silver are the colours of Sindar hair, and some type of golden (whether that be blonde or ginger I’ll let you decide) is the colour of Silvan hair. And if this is the case, then I’d speculate that Thranduil’s golden hair suggests that he may be the product of interbreeding between a Sindar father and a Laiquendi mother. 

And the aforementioned Unfinished Tales passage does pretty much state that when Oropher and his people arrived in the Woodland Realm, many of his Sindar 'went native', and before long they assimilated themselves into the pre-existing Silvan society of the Greenwood. In fact Tolkien tells us “*they did this deliberately”.* 

So if we accept that Legolas’s grandmother may indeed have been descended from one of the Silvan Elves of the Greenwood, then this would make Legolas at least 25% Silvan and at most 75% Silvan. Now we would be able to narrow this down a bit more if we knew *anything* about his mother, but alas we do not. And this is why the question of Legolas’s hair colour is so interesting. Close your eyes and picture him again. If you’re imagining a character with dark or silvery grey hair, then the implication is that Thranduil took a wife with at least some significant degree of Sindar heritage. And this would suggest that even two generations after Oropher, there is still some sort of divide between the elite Sindar rulers, and their majority Silvan populace.  However, if you’re imagining Legolas with golden, blonde or ginger hair, then this implies that the Sindar truly did go native, and the Woodland rulers are now indistinguishable from the people they rule. Perhaps, just as Oropher intended, the Sindar and the Silvan merged into something new. Perhaps the Sindar made the Silvan a bit more wise, and the Silvan made the Sindar a bit more dangerous? 

Whenever we talk about Elves in Middle-earth, the conversation tends to revolve around the Elves of the West and their descendants.  And this is probably fair enough, as the Noldor are truly fascinating characters, and they do seem to love creating drama. But while discussing the big name characters like Galadriel, and Elrond, and Glorfindel, we mustn’t forget the Elves of the East. The woodland folk who Tolkien told us so little about. They did not build great cities, nor were they masters of lore, but they do demonstrate the virtues of a simpler life, in tune with nature. They are mysterious and secretive, but ancient and fair. And because Tolkien’s Legendarium is somehow both amazingly detailed in its scope, but also strangely reserved in regards to character descriptions, we’re able to use our mind’s eye to create our own conclusions about the simpler, humbler, and more dangerous variety of woodland Elves.  

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on Legolas and how you imagine him. As some of you may know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

Thanks again everyone. Much love and stay groovy ❤️",Fantasy
1649649884.0,So it seems Amazon has changed their 1-5 star system so only written reviews are showing on author's pages currently. Just rating a book doesn't seem to do anything anymore. This is causing authors to lose 99% of their ratings and makes new releases look like they are failing.,"Starting on April 5th, authors have reported that their ratings have dropped almost 99%. Many of us have gone from getting 20-50 ratings/reviews a day to 1-2 a day max. Sales have stayed consistent so the only change is in the ratings, with such a steep dropoff it has to be something internal with Amazon.

In discussions within various author groups, we've realized what is happening is that the ratings (where you just click the amount of stars to give without leaving a written review) are no longer doing anything. We don't know if the ratings just aren't showing up on Amazon, or if nobody is being asked to give ratings anymore, or what is happening.

All we know is that authors are seeing a 99% drop in ratings/reviews and it is making authors who just released a new book look like their book is absolutely tanking compared to every other book out there. Books that should have 100s of ratings after big opening weeks have 3 or 4 reviews total.

I just wanted to try to bring this to more people's attention. If you see a book that just launched that only has a few reviews, don't be afraid to give it a chance.

And if you finish a book you really liked, **please** leave a written review for now to help the author as much as possible.

Edit: As of this morning - after five days without any ratings showing - reports are coming in that they are BACK! Either Amazon fixed whatever was wrong or maybe enough people started talking about the issue that someone noticed the problem, but either way thank you all for bringing visibility to this issue!!",Fantasy

1576557940.0,My experience on having my debut edited by the Big Five,"My debut space opera noir novel, Stormblood got picked up last year by Gollancz as the first of a trilogy. And, like any other Trad published book, it goes through the rounds of editing. I'd already edited the book thoroughly, with myself, beta readers, my agent. When it ended up in the hands of my editor Gillian Redfearn (who also edits Brandon Sanderson, Joe Abercrombie and Patrick Rothfuss in the UK) I thought there wouldn't be too much more work to do.

I was very, very wrong.

There's a lot in this industry that isn't always transparent but should be. Many of you may be interested in working with a Big Five editor yourselves one day, so I wanted to provide some insight into the guts and gears of the editing process, the various hoops and cycles a book goes through, and what my personal experience has been in crunching the revisions. 

I believe it’s very underestimated how extensive the editing process is when it comes to traditional publishing. We’re not talking about cleaning up typos, chopping away gratuitous sentences and chapters , or even tweaking character arcs. No, we’re talking about digging down into the root canals of the narrative, the bones of what gives a book its identity. Fleshing out the ambiance, the structure, the voice, the style, and using this understanding in context to influence how you approach edits.

It sounds like a mouthful, but it’s necessary to see your work from a different light. And it’s necessary to take that mental stance when editing. It’s so easy to get caught up in the minute, in one chapter, that you don’t take the necessary steps back and look at the book as a whole. That scene has great dialogue, but is it disrupting the pacing? That’s an interesting turn of events, but could it be entirely rewritten to be better? The tricky thing is, it’s not about what’s objectively better. It’s about whether it’s better for your book, your style, your voice. If I wanted to have my book have breakneck pacing from cover to cover, we’d be taking a completely different approach.

So that’s what we did for the first round of edits. In taking a step back and looking at the naked scaffolding of the structure, we realised there needed to be some changes early in the book, in terms of character motivation, relationships and backstory. Which changes the way the entire book, and the main character, comes across. Not in a major way, but significantly enough. And that’s where playing word jenga comes in: because the wrong sentence in the wrong place can get your entire book to come crashing down around your head.

After we agreed to make the change, my editor worked on the first half of the book to reflect this. This meant tweaking characters, shuffling certain flashback scenes. At this point, I don’t touch anything on a sentence-level, any of the prose. This is all big-picture stuff.

I applied the changes, and sent it back to my editor. My editor then re-edited the first-half of the book again, because she’s a pro, and edited the second half in as a consequence of the changes we made in the first half. Because, if she didn’t, we’d be seeing two very different stories.
This is what I meant at the start, about looking at the bare bones of your book.

So I edited the second half again. Tightening characters, adding and removing world-building, checking for continuity, and in some cases, completely re-writing scenes, or the internal mechanics of a scene. This means I change what the characters go about doing in order to complete their goals, whether they accomplish them, what the consequences are. Big-picture stuff that ripples out. As an example, one battle sequence was very run and gun. We retooled it to be about tactics and team co-operation. Another scene had a character try to get information from someone, blowing his cover pretty soon and searching the guy’s place. Instead, I had him remain undercover almost the entire time, slowly up the dread and tension the two characters play verbal cat and mouse, until one breaks.

It’s a hell of a headache, and it’s not easy to take scenes that have written a certain way, been in place, for years, and strip them out and completely retool them, but it’s necessary. And it almost always means a better book.

Then comes my next pass. I make most use of my editor’s comments in this round. Plugging logic gaps, tightening sentences, adding or deleting sentences, making sure all the dialogue is consistent with the characters, chopping away the ugly word clay, fixing up the location of the scene (and moving it, if need be) making adjustments that impact the scene, but nothing else. This is where the book is more or less falling into place. It’s probably the part I enjoy the most, putting the meat on the bone so the plot, story, characters and descriptions read smoothly and consistently.

The next round is where I am now. Fixing up sentence-level structure, word-choice, prose, and descriptions. My editor’s mighty red pen has left it’s mark on every single page, so there’s no getting away from it. It’s tempting to call it purely cosmetics, but my work is first-person, very voice-driven, and the state of the main character absolutely impacts the prose. I don’t care too much about flowery word-choice or elegant descriptions, but I absolutely care about each word sounding like it could come from the protagonist’s mouth. So I make sure my sentences are running smoothly, so a heedlessly complicated word or turn of phrase doesn’t turn into a jolting speed-bump. I ensure the sentences and paragraphs have a nice rhythm and balance to them. I deliberately purge any “flowery” prose, any words that detract from the tone I’m trying to strike, any poorly-timed metaphors. So words like “illuminate” and “sparkle” or any of their relations are chopped out. I’m trying to write sharp, razor-edged prose with a good dose of sarcasm and cynicism when needed. So specific word-choice, and how the words are conveyed, matter. I’m still going through it, and will probably be doing so for the first half of December, if not a little more.

And then, of course, when all’s said and done, there’s copy edits.
So there’s a lot of hours and a lot of work poured into editing a book, both by the editor and author. But here’s the thing about print: it lasts forever. So if a sentence, paragraph, chapter, or even character, is lacking, it’ll be lacking forever. And it’s my debut, and you know what they say about getting one chance to make a first impression. . .

Either way, I hope this was insightful or helpful to you all.

ETA: Wow! Gold! Never that had happen before. Thank you kindly, stranger. It's most appreciated. 
I've had a few people message me asking about buying the book, so I'll say that pre-orders are disproportionately helpful to debut authors. They tell the publishers, booksellers, marketers, etc, that there's an audience and numbers to back it up. It's already up on Amazon and Audible for all regional retailers (except US), so I'm linking to Book Depository. It's free shipping worldwide. The book comes out in June, and if you're able to pre-order, it would help immensely.

**A Comprehensive List of Authors I've Read**

* Brian Sanderson - I'm amazed how he single-handedly revolutionized the genre. It's a shame no other author has his work ethic.
* JRR Tolkien - Obviously. The man invented fantasy. You can't call yourself a fantasy fan if you haven't read him.
* Erik Stevenson - I know Malazan is almost a meme at this point, but have you tried it?
* Jim Butcher - This whole ""urban fantasy"" thing is radical and awesome. Why doesn't anyone else try to write in this genre?
* Robert Jordan - Amazing. If you don't like his writing at first, keep reading! Book 12 is where things really pick up.
* Robin Hobb - Love him!

**What I'm Looking For**

* Realism. Some people seem to think that women and people of color existed in Medieval Europe, and I'm honor-bound to correct them. 
* It has to be bloody! I've read--well, actually just vaguely heard about--lots of books where no one is killed by the third page. It's not only boring, it's unrealistic (see above).
* Epic! I know, I know, that covers literally all of fantasy. But some people not as well-read as myself don't understand this.
* Ideally something that I've already heard of.
* Something objectively great. I'm not interested in books you personally like, just what the free market has determined to be best.

**What I'm** ***NOT*** **Looking For**

* I'd rather avoid romance, unless it's of a similar quality to Brian Sanderson's work.
* It must be mature. None of the young adult garbage. I'm not a young person.
* No Mary Sues, please. I like my characters struggling to face their challenges and failing a lot before they succeed. For a good example of this, think of Kvothe from The Kingkiller Chronicles.
* I won't read unfinished series. Sorry, but I prefer to have the entire story available before I begin. That means I usually have large book hauls when I go to the store, but what can I say? I like to support authors.
* Please don't try to shove diversity down my throat. Like with the recent Hugo finalist announcement. Had you ever even heard of any of those books? I hadn't, so they can't possibly be good.

If my requirements seem intimidating, don't worry! Before I became a veteran fantasy reader, I was in your shoes once. Although that was months ago, I can still remember it like it was yesterday. 

Anyway, I've already read all the truly good fantasy books. Now I'm just looking for the next-best thing.",Fantasy

As we’re all in different time zones, we will be answering questions throughout the day (with, in my case, breaks to wrangle kids and/or hyperventilate over my brief digital proximity to this list of writers). Ask us anything!!!

Here’s a bit more about the *Into Shadow* collection: 

Some truths are carefully concealed; others merely forgotten. In this spellbinding collection, seven acclaimed fantasy authors create characters who venture into the depths where others fear to tread. But when forbidden knowledge is the ultimate power, how far can they go before the darkness consumes them?

* *The Six Deaths of the Saint* by Alix E. Harrow: The Saint of War spares the life of a servant girl so she can fulfill her destiny as the kingdom’s greatest warrior in this short story of love and loyalty. Always mindful of the debt she owes, the girl finds her worth as a weapon in the hand of the Prince. Her victories make him a king, then an emperor. The bards sing her name and her enemies fear it. But the war never ends and the cost keeps rising—how many times will she repeat her own story?
* *Out of the Mirror, Darkness* by Garth Nix: A cynical “fixer” for a silent-film studio must confront the shadows behind the bright lights in this noir-tinged short story. It’s business as usual on the set of another cheap sword-and-sandal production by Pharos Pictures—until the lead actress suddenly falls into a deep, mysterious sleep. Jordan Harper can talk down high-strung starlets and knock sense into stuntmen, but this…this is the kind of uncanny problem that he’d usually bring to Mrs. Hope. Unfortunately, the preternaturally capable secretary is on a business trip with the studio head. Harper must get to the bottom of the mystery on his own before another cast member succumbs—or worse, they blow the budget.
* *Persephone* by Lev Grossman: A teenage nobody crosses a line that will change her life forever in this short coming-of-age story. Ever since her dad disappeared five years ago, Persephone has quietly walled off the feelings she’d rather not feel. There’s no room for pain or anger when you’re just trying to get through the hell that is high school. But one day, the crush of taunts and disappointments is finally too much—and a power breaks loose inside her that she never knew was there. 
* *What the Dead Know* by Nghi Vo: A woman posing as a medium who can channel the spirit world comes face to face with the truth in this short historical fantasy. The Fogg River Seminary, a girls’ school in a small Illinois town, is supposed to be just another stop on Maryse and Vasyl’s endless travels. They’ve made lucrative use of Maryse’s “foreign” looks in their melodramatic séance act—and an act is all it is. Then, during their performance, a blizzard sweeps in and cuts them off from town completely. In the freezing halls, there’s a voice speaking the secrets of the dead, and Maryse has no choice but to listen…because this time, the voice is real.
* *Undercover* by Tamsyn Muir: When a stranger comes to town, secrets are sure to come out. A fresh-faced newcomer arrives in an isolated, gang-run town and soon finds herself taking a job nobody else wants: bodyguard to a ghoul. Not just your average mindless, half-rotted shuffler, though. Lucille is a dancer who can still put on her own lipstick and whose shows are half burlesque, half gladiator match. But the stranger is no stranger to this particular ghoul. Both women are undercover in their own way. And both have something to lose if their connection comes to light.
* *The Candles Are Burning* by Veronica G. Henry: Amid the modern trappings of 1950s Savannah, an ancient evil threatens a young widow and her daughter in this chilling short story. When her husband dies unexpectedly, Maggie Royal is struck with sinister visions that foretell danger for her and for her five-year-old daughter. Her mother and grandmother were said to have “the sight,” but it was never like this. With no one alive to turn to, Maggie must move quickly to uncover the meaning of her visions before her candle is snuffed out.
* *The Garden* by Tomi Champion-Adeyemi: In this dreamlike short story told in alternating prose and verse, Champion-Adeyemi weaves a tale of a young woman’s journey to find her mother and uncover her secrets. Fifteen years ago, Lęina’s mother, Yuliana, went searching for a mythical place called the Garden and never returned. Determined to learn the truth about what happened, Lęina travels to Brazil to search for the hidden realm, with Yuliana’s journal and a local tour guide leading the way. But Lęina soon begins to wonder if she’s looking for answers—or if what she truly wants to find is herself.",Fantasy

1634035530.0,Happy 42nd Birthday to The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel),"Douglas Adams's novel, *The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, turns 42 today.

Published on 12 October 1979, the novel was based on Adams's radio series of the same name which had aired eighteen months earlier on the BBC. With the radio series a huge success, Adams was convinced to turn the series into a book. Adams only adapted the first four parts of the radio series into the book, saving the rest for the sequel, *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* (published a year later), although, as was his wont, Adams made major plot and character changes between the different versions of the story. The same held true of the excellent BBC mini-series (which aired in 1981), the video game (1984) and feature film (2005), which all feature significant differences and twists to the same basic premise.

The novel sold extremely well, shifting 250,000 copies in its first three months on sale. Unusually for a British comedic SF novel, the book was a hit in the United States as well and sales of the novel passed a million in 1984, with Adams becoming a minor celebrity for his views on science and technology. Total sales of the novel are now believed to be in the neighbourhood of 20 million. *The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy* is one of the two biggest-selling individual SF novels\* of all time, a position it has swapped fairly regularly with *Dune* in the last few years, although a recent boost in sales for *Dune* (driven by the new movie adaptation) have almost certainly moved it back into first place and *Hitch-Hiker's* into second.

As with most versions of the story, *The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy* novel opens with Earth being demolished by the officious and callous Vogons to make room for a hyperspace by-pass. Ford Prefect, a field researcher for the eponymous book who has been conducting research on Earth for fifteen years, elects to rescue his best friend Arthur Dent from certain death and they flee into deep space. After an improbable meeting with Ford's semi-cousin Zaphod Beeblebrox (the part-time Galactic President who's now on the run after stealing a hyper-advanced starship for no rational reason), they find themselves caught up in a wild, ancient conspiracy involving god-like computers, dolphins, mice, an alien fjord-designer and, of course, the number 42, which holds the key to the secrets of life, the universe, and everything. Or it would, if anyone knew what the hell the question was.

Sadly, Douglas Adams passed away in 2001 at the far-too-young age of 49 and is not here to celebrate the milestone his famous novel has achieved. However, I am certain that, demolition of the Earth by bad poetry-reciting aliens allowing, the novel will still be going strong in another 42 years from now.

\*Sales estimates of *The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy* are complicated due to the fact that it is a very short novel, so for most of its existence it has been published in handy omnibus formats with various of its sequels; the biggest-selling edition of the book is believed to be a 1985 omnibus edition that packaged it with its three immediate sequels: *The Restaurant at the End of the Universe* (1980), *Life, the Universe and Everything* (1982) and *So Long and Thanks For All the Fish* (1984). After 1992, this was supplanted by a five-volume omnibus that added *Mostly Harmless* (1992), the final book in the series. However, *Dune* has a similar estimate problem due to the extreme popularity of a hardcover omnibus that contains the first three books in its series which has been in print since the late 1970s. Sales of the two works appear to be roughly comparable.",Fantasy

The metaphor of orcs in lotr seems pretty clear to me. They are industrialization incarnate. Elves who got twisted by sauron's war machine, people turned into tools. The urakhai are an extension of it, not only are they tools, but they are tools which are replaced, made so far removed from the original that they aren't even ever children. They are expendable, they are miserable, they are twisted and corrupted beings who twist and corrupt and destroy the world around them.  Destroy what is beautiful and use it as fuel.

Its a pretty fascinating original fantasy monster, and one I REALLY like... which surprised me because I have not liked any version of orcs I have previously seen.  Mostly it's the tusks, which I am just not a fan of in character design, but every other version of orcs I have seen always goes for either the ""proud warrior race""  or ""noble savage shamans"" type, both of which are not my thing, and seem like the DIRECT OPPOSITE of lotr orcs. They aren't proud, they hate nature, they don't seem spiritual in the least. And I am just kind of confused about how we got from lotr's industry incarnate to Eberron's druidic protectors of nature.

Thank you.


You have thousands of reviews, and millions of people enjoying your novels, but every author wants to know that their work has meaning, that their work has touched people's lives. 


My mother passed away on the night of Feburary 10th. It was her that pulled my sister and I into reading.  She said that ""she fell in love with words, and how they can touch a heart, and make you think.""



My mother filled my sister and my lives with whimsy and magic.  Trips to the library every summer, painting unicorns on our walls, hunting for fairies, and so so many books.  We three were fantasy's wild children.  She was such a well-read woman, but fantasy was her home.



One of the last series we read together was The Stormlight Archives.  I would tuck her in at night, and we'd talk for way to long about our adventures in the books.  Where we were at, our theories, the excitement. I don't know how many times I would say goodnight, only to come right back and keep talking.



I remember the part where Kaladin was tied outside and the storm was coming.  I ran out of my room because I just had to talk to my mom about it.  When your third book comes out, I don't know what I'm going to do.  I'm so sad she won't get to finish the series.



She would always ask me though, ""Where is he with the third book now?"", because she knew I was watching your website tracker.



She loved Hoid, he made her laugh. And she'd want you to know that she thought you did the Wheel of Time justice. She said no one could have done it but you. When I took her to the doctor, we would listen to Writing Excuses, she loved the way you talked about writing.



I'm so lost and I may even regret writing this later. But, I wanted to thank you.  You gave us so many happy moments together during some really hard times.  



Thank you for the gift of your words, Mr Sanderson.

1666202831.0,Is reading The Wheel of Time worth it? Here's my argument that it is.,"*The Wheel of Time* is 14 books long and some Brandon Sanderson fans read it because Sanderson wrote the last three books. But that means reading 11 books to get to the last three, so is it worth it?

I say it is. I've read the series four times. But I do think some warnings are in order.

First, the first book in the series, *The Eye of the World*, was published in 1990 when every publisher wanted the next *The Lord of the Rings*. So author Robert Jordan made it deliberately Tolkienesque. Yet it takes a sharp turn in book 2 and never looks back. And a close reading of tEotW reveals many cracks in the Tolkienesque facade, foreshadowing how it will fall apart in book 2 and the rest of the series.

Second, WoT has an ensemble of main characters. We meet many but not all of them in the first book. They go through a lot of changes over 14 books. The character arcs are wild. Characters you dislike at first become fan favorites, and characters you like at first may become less likable. So if you are getting tired of certain characters, just give it time.

Third, the world in which it the story is set gets stranger and stranger over the course of the series, as the characters from a little village explore more cultures. Robert Jordan leaned into that strangeness. If it seems too normal and recognizable at the beginning, just wait.

Fourth, *The Wheel of Time* had a huge impact on the fantasy genre. It serves as a transition between Tolkien and the grimdark fantasies that have become popular today. On the one hand, there's still a Tolkienesque conflict between Good and Evil. But the ""free peoples"" are not all so free, and often fight amongst themselves as much as they fight the Dark One and his minions. Along with Robert E. Howard's Conan stories or Tolkien's Middle-Earth stories, WoT is one of the landmark works of fantasy that impacted all future fantasy authors, because each of those authors had to choose whether to be like or unlike this mountainous work in their genre.

Fifth, for Sanderson fans, I actually like Sanderson's work on WoT better than any of his other books because of the blend of Jordan's eccentric brilliance and Sanderson's more straightforward approach. And new readers have the advantage of being able to binge the whole series, rather than waiting on each new book, and wondering if it would ever be finished after Jordan died.

But keep in mind that because the books were published far apart, and because the story is so long, Jordan sometimes offered summaries of what happened in previous books. The advantage of this is that you can read the series quickly without fear of forgetting anything important. If it's important, Jordan will remind you. The disadvantage is that sometimes the pace of the story may seem slow, in which case I encourage you to just read faster, skimming if necessary.

Finally, the WoT series has a lot of flaws as well as strengths. But there's something about a 14-volume story that's just unlike anything shorter. To give you an idea of what I mean, Sanderson was originally hired to finish the series in one volume, and even he couldn't do it. Instead he asked for and received permission to wrap it all up in merely three giant volumes, and was remarkably efficient in doing so.",Fantasy
1608378528.0,Aragorn's Origins: How Does a Ranger Become a King?,"You guys had a lot of lovely things to say about last week's Lord of the Rings post, so here's another...

There are few characters in the Lord of the Rings who are more crucial to the plot than Aragorn. He’s a guide to the Hobbits, a champion to the Rohirrm, and a king to the Men of Gondor. In fact of the six books that make up the Lord of the Rings, more of them feature Aragorn than either Frodo or the Ring. In his first appearance at the Prancing Pony, he is simply Strider of the wilderness. But only seven months later, he is crowned King Elessar of the Dúnedain. So how does a ranger from the North become king in the South? And what exactly was Aragorn doing in the eighty-seven years leading up to it?

So in order to fully understand how a ranger can become a king, we first need to go all the way back to the moment of Aragorn’s birth. Because just like his father and grandfather before him, Aragorn was actually born into royalty. His ancestors were kings. His name literally means “*Revered King*”. And yet Aragorn was born with no lands to rule. He was an Heir of Isildur, but he had no kingdom to inherit. All he had was his name.

You see back in the early Third Age, the proud Kingdom of Arnor - the Kingdom of Elendil and Isildur - fell to the power of the Witch-king. Almost a thousand years before Aragorn was even born, the kings of both Arnor and Gondor were wiped out, and all that remained of Isildur’s descendants were the humble Chieftains of the Dúnedain. The Chieftains of the Rangers of the North. And at the time of Aragorn’s birth, these rangers had fallen on hard times.

So just as Aragorn is an Heir of Isildur, so too was his father Arathorn, and his grandfather Arador. But unfortunately, being an Heir of Isildur comes with its fair share of dangers. You see, although the strength of the Dúnedain had significantly waned since the days of Isildur, the very fact that they still existed, made them a threat to Sauron. And Sauron knew it. He feared the heirs of the man who cut the ring from his finger, and so as long as the Dark Lord endured, the Heirs of Isildur were not safe.

The year before Aragorn was born, his grandfather Arador was captured and killed by trolls of the Coldfells. And only three years later, Aragorn’s father, Arathorn, was slain by an orc arrow through the eye. So, when Aragorn was only two years old, he became the *last* surviving Heir of Isildur. Eighty-five years before the Lord of the Rings, the future of the Dúnedain rested upon the fate of a baby. A baby who was destined to be king.

Now, over the course of Aragorn’s story we’ll see that there are a number of notable symmetries between Aragorn, and two of his (exceedingly) distant ancestors from the First Age – Beren and Tuor. You see all three of these guys were mighty rulers of Men, who’d had their realms conquered by the Enemy before they were full-grown. All three of them lost their fathers at a young age, and crucially, all three of them went on to take an exceptional Elf as their bride. Now it’s hardly an essential detail, but I will point out that Aragorn and his ancestor Tuor *both* lost their respective fathers to a poisoned orc arrow through the eye, within just a year or so of being born. Now I’m not really sure if this is a thought-provoking parallel, or just a strangely specific coincidence, but either way, it is kind of interesting.

Anyway, the real question here revolves around why Aragorn grows up to be a king of the Dúnedain, when all the previous Heirs of Isildur were simply chieftains. What did Aragorn have that his ancestors didn’t?

So it obviously goes without saying that Aragorn did indeed survive his childhood, but he didn’t do so as a Ranger of the North. You see, Aragorn’s mother was a woman called Gilraen, and with Arathorn dead, Gilraen brought her son, in secret, to the Elven refuge of Rivendell. And there, Aragorn first met Lord Elrond. Now if you’re primarily familiar with the Lord of the Rings movies, then you may be of the understanding that Elrond and Aragorn have a bit of an uneasy relationship, but in Tolkien’s writings, this couldn’t be further from the truth.

Tolkien tells us “*Elrond took the place of his father and came to love him as a son.”* He raised Aragorn in Rivendell as one of “*his own*,” and although Aragorn was too young to retain any memory of Arathorn or his life among the Rangers, in the House of Elrond, Aragorn grew up to be *“elven-wise”.* And this is certainly a big deal in explaining Aragorn’s rise from ranger to king, but it’s not something that’s unique to Aragorn. It was a in fact a tradition amongst the Dúnedain for the Heirs of Isildur to be fostered by the Elves in Rivendell. And both Arathorn and Arador also spent their childhoods with Lord Elrond. But in Aragorn’s case, there was something different.

You see, it was decided by the Wise that Aragorn’s name and lineage should be kept a secret until he came of age. Not only would this protect the last Heir of Isildur from the dangers of the outside world, but it also prevented Sauron from learning of his existence. And so, throughout all of Aragorn’s formative years, he was known simply as *Estel* – which means ‘trust’ and ‘hope’ in the Elvish language.

And to be honest, Tolkien doesn’t tell us very much about Aragorn’s boyhood, but I reckon it must have been pretty amazing. I mean just imagine what it would be like for a mortal Man to be raised entirely amongst Elves. We’re told that by the time Aragorn was twenty, he was “*fair and noble and was early come to manhood.”* And just like his father and grandfather before him, Aragorn developed a cherished friendship with Elrond’s twin sons, the Elven rangers Elladan and Elrohir. In fact, in his youth Aragorn ventured off into the wilds with these adoptive brothers, and I imagine it was at this time that he developed many of the skills we’ll later see during the Lord of the Rings. We know that Aragorn is a gifted ranger, and an excellent tracker, and an exceptional healer, and yet he didn’t acquire these skills from the Dúnedain. Instead, Aragorn’s abilities come from the Elves.

However, Aragorn’s youthful days as Estel did of course have to come to an end, and when he turned twenty-one, and “*returned to Rivendell after great deeds in the company of the sons of Elrond”,* it was time for Estel to learn the truth. So in the year 2952, Lord Elrond called Aragorn by his true name for the first time, and he presented Aragorn with heirlooms from the House of Isildur. Now of these heirlooms, three are particularly important in explaining Aragorn’s journey from ranger to king. One of these heirlooms is the broken blade Narsil, which was of course used to cut the One Ring from Sauron’s finger, and will of course one day be reforged into Andúril; and another heirloom is the Ring of Barahir, which is the same ring that we see Aragorn wearing in the movies. Now this ring has a bit of a crazy history, and it’s very possibly the single oldest piece of jewellery in Middle-earth. It predates the Rings of Power by thousands of years, and it’s even older than the sun and the moon. And unfortunately there’s nowhere near enough time to fully explain how this ring ended up in Isildur’s possession, but way back, possibly around ten thousand years ago, its original owner was actually Galadriel’s older brother. And he gave this ring to a mortal Man called Barahir. And as it goes, Barahir was the father of Aragorn’s First Age ancestor Beren. So this Ring of Barahir is a big deal, and it’s a hugely significant part of Aragorn’s family history.

Now the last heirloom of Isildur’s that Elrond had in his possession was a silver rod called the Sceptre of Annúminas. And this Sceptre of Annúminas was also ancient, and it originally belonged to Elendil - the first High King of the Dúnedain. The sceptre was both an artefact of Númenor and a symbol of the Ancient Kings of Men. But unlike the Shards of Narsil and the Ring of Barahir, Elrond did not give the Sceptre of Annúminas to Aragorn. For Aragorn was not yet a king. Instead he told his adopted son that the Sceptre *“I withhold, for you have yet to earn it.”* But he also told Aragorn *“that the span of your life shall be greater than the measure of Men, unless evil befalls you or you fail at the test.”*

Now this test is very important. In fact I would argue that it is critical in understanding Aragorn’s journey from ranger to king. And it’s also critical in unravelling the character of Aragorn in the books from Aragorn in the movies.

So I feel most people will agree that Viggo Mortensen did a fantastic job at portraying Aragorn in Peter Jackson’s films; I personally don’t have a bad thing to say about him. But the way that the character is written in the movies is very different from how he’s written in the books. You know, in the movies he’s afflicted with doubt about his destiny, but Tolkien actually tells us that after learning the truth of his heritage, Aragorn’s *“heart was high within him…for he was full of hope.”* It seems that Aragorn agreed with his adoptive father’s assertion that the kingship had to be earned. And I believe that this desire to earn his destiny, and to prove himself worthy of Isildur and his heirs, is a critical part of what motivates Aragorn throughout the next six decades of his life.

However, before I get too far ahead of myself, there’s one more character that needs to be introduced to this story. Because although Elrond, and Elladan, and Elrohir are all crucial players in Aragorn’s youth, there’s one more member of their family who’s remained conspicuously absent up until this point.

You see, *literally* the very next day after learning the truth about his lineage, Aragorn went out into the woods for a solitary walk. And whilst he was out, he began singing a song called the *Lay of Lúthien,*which tells the story of how that distant ancestor Beren, first encountered the angelic Elf-maiden Lúthien, AKA his future wife. Now there’s definitely more than one example of symmetry between Aragorn and Beren, but right here we see what is perhaps the most striking one. Because we’re told that while Aragorn was singing this song about Beren and Lúthien, “*Lúthien walked before his eyes in Rivendell.”* And I feel like this must have been an incredibly surreal moment for Aragorn; partly because Lúthien was his grandmother 67 times removed, and also partly because she’d been dead for 6480 years by this point. Also she lived thousands of miles away in a part of the world that doesn’t even exist anymore, so you probably don’t need me to tell you that it turns out, Aragorn was mistaken. The woman who stood before him “*clad in a mantle of silver and blue, fair as the twilight”* was not in fact the ghost of Lúthien, but instead she was her great great granddaughter. Arwen Undómiel.

Now we all know that Arwen’s father was Aragorn’s adoptive father, and we all know that Arwen’s brothers were Aragorn’s adoptive brothers, but thankfully, Arwen and Aragorn never had any sort of brother/sister relationship. And this is because, throughout Aragorn’s first twenty-one years of life, Arwen had been entirely absent from Rivendell. Instead of living with her father and brothers, she’d been living far away in Lothlórien, with her grandparents Galadriel and Celeborn. And so, only one day after learning the truth about his heritage, Aragorn met Arwen for the very fist time. And Tolkien tells us that in this moment, Aragorn believed he’d “*strayed into a dream.”*

Now, apparently Aragorn isn’t particularly great at hiding his emotions, because “*in the* *days that followed”* both his mother Gilraen, and Lord Elrond, “*perceived that some strange thing had come over him.”* And although I don’t believe Elrond was exactly thrilled about his adoptive son falling in love with his only daughter, he wasn’t quite as grumpy about it as he is in the movies. We’re told that Elrond said to Aragorn “*the years will bring what they will. We will speak no more of this until many have passed.”* And it appears that Aragorn agreed to his adoptive father’s terms, because the very next day after this conversation, “*he took leave lovingly of Elrond,”* and disappeared into the wild for nearly thirty years!

And I guess these years mark a really significant turning point in Aragorn’s life. Because up until this departure, he’d lived his whole life as Estel, but in the space of only a few days, Aragorn had learned the truth about his ancestry, he’d inherited two out of three heirlooms of Isildur’s, and he’d come face to face with the woman he’d eventually end up marrying. And so I believe it’s during these years in the wilderness that Estel of Rivendell truly grows into Aragorn of the Dúnedain. And Tolkien actually gives us some really cool details about what Aragorn was getting up during these long years in the wild.

So for the first four years of his travels, it seems that Aragorn stayed in the North, and he explored the lands of his ancestors and his kin. And it’s during these years of wandering the North that Aragorn first encountered his future friend, Gandalf the Grey. And it was actually upon the wizard’s advice that Aragorn first began to take an interest in the secretive northern realm known as the Shire. Over the course of his travels, the Men of the North came to know Aragorn by reputation, but he kept his true identity a secret from all save his fellow rangers. And so, as the years went on Aragorn became known in the North as Strider. And this is a name he’ll carry with him for the rest of his life. In fact when Aragorn eventually does become King Elessar, he adopts the name Telcontar as the name of his Royal House, and his family name. And what Telcontar literally means is simply Strider, in the Quneya language of the High Elves.

Anyway, while Aragorn lingered in the North, all was not well in the South. Only a few years after he left Rivendell, “*Mount Doom burst into flame”,* and in the very same year that Aragorn learned of his lineage, “*Sauron declared himself openly…*\[and\] *began the rebuilding of Barad-dûr.”* So at the age of just twenty-six, Aragorn undertook his first great journey into the South, and for the first time in his life, he passed into the lands of Rohan and Gondor. And for the next twenty-three years, Aragorn aided the Free Peoples of the West, in their renewed war against Sauron.

In fact, it was during this time, that Aragorn first encountered a few familiar faces from the Lord of the Rings, including a nine-year-old Théoden, and a twenty-seven year old Denethor. However just as he did while living in the North, Aragorn kept his heritage and his true name a secret. And so to the Men of Rohan and Gondor, Aragorn became known as Thorongil, which means *The Eagle of the Star, “for he was swift and keen-eyed, and wore a silver star upon his cloak.”*

Now, Tolkien doesn’t tell us very much about Thorongil’s exploits in Rohan, except that for some time he rode alongside Théoden’s father King Tengel. But he does give us some very cool details about what Thorongil got up to in Gondor. You see Denethor’s father, and Boromir’s grandfather, was the Steward Ecthelion, and we’re told that Ecthelion was “*a man of wisdom”* who *“began to strengthen his realm against the assault of Mordor.”* And so, Ecthelion encouraged *“all men of worth”* to come to Minas Tirith and to enter his service. And of course the captain that Ecthelion “*loved above all”* was Thorongil.

Now Thorongil certainly made a name for himself in Minas Tirith, and his greatest achievement came during his campaign against Gondor’s ancestral enemies, the Corsairs of Umbar. Tolkien tells us that with Ecthelion’s leave, Throrongil “*gathered a small fleet”* and sailed into Umbar under the cover of night. There he “*burned* *a great part of the ships of the Corsairs”* and he even killed their Captain in single combat upon the quays. However when the time came for the victorious fleet of Gondorians to return to Minas Tirith, and to receive the favour of Ecthelion, Thorongil departed, and he journeyed alone towards the Mountains of Mordor. And as it turns out, Aragorn would not set foot in Minas Tirith again, until he came to the Houses of Healing after the Battle of Pelennor Fields.

You see, although pretty much everyone in Gondor absolutely loved Thorongil, there was one person who didn’t. And that person was that Ecthelion’s son and heir, Denethor. Now we’re told that Denethor was “*subtle in mind and looked further and deeper than other men of his day.”* And it’s implied that Denethor was the only one who discovered the truth about Thorongil’s identity. And it seems he feared that Thorongil would one day supplant him as the future ruler of Gondor. Which technically, he wasn’t wrong to worry about.

But anyway just before I move one, there’s one more potentially really lovely detail here. Because two years before Aragorn’s battle with the Corsairs, Denethor’s wife gave birth to their first son. And this son is of course Boromir. So it’s very possible that perhaps Aragorn and Boromir may have met, right at the beginning of Boromir’s life. Perhaps Aragorn even held him as a baby. Now it’s incredibly unlikely that Boromir would ever have known about this, but if we skip forward just under forty years to the end of Boromir’s life, then we’ll find that Aragorn is there once again, holding Boromir in his arms as he dies. It’s another really beautiful moment of potential symmetry.

Anyway, after leaving Gondor and Rohan, Aragorn’s life once again becomes a bit of a mystery. Tolkien tells us that he ventured southeast, and he even journeyed into the lands around Mordor. We know that he explored “*the hearts of men good and evil”* and he discovered many of the “*plots and devices”* that were contrived by the servants of Sauron. However beyond that, Aragorn’s odyssey through the lands of the Enemy remains a mystery.

But eventually, Aragorn’s days of wandering the wilds did come to an end. And at the ripe old age of forty-nine, Aragorn returned from the lands of shadow to seek rest and recuperation once again with the Elves. However this time it wasn’t Elrond or his sons in Rivendell that Aragorn sought shelter with, but instead, he came to the hidden realm of Lothlórien, where he first encountered the Lady Galadriel and her husband Celeborn.

Now, I guess it’s fair to say that when Aragorn first arrived in Lothlórien he probably wasn’t looking his best. I mean he’d just spent a good deal of time wandering around “*the dark confines of Mordor”* so I imagine he wasn’t really dressed to impress. But, good old Galadriel perceived that Aragorn was now “*grown to full stature of body and mind”,* and so she gave him what I can really only describe as a makeover. We’re told that Galadriel “*clothed him in silver and white, with a cloak of elven-grey and a bright gem upon his brow.”* And this restyling is important, because what happens next is the final catalyst in Aragorn’s journey from ranger to king.

You see, what Aragorn did not know, was that in the nearly thirty years since he’d left Rivendell, Arwen had also travelled back to Lothlórien. And she just so happened to be there at the same time as Aragorn. And this is where we see a lovely little reversal of Aragorn and Arwen’s first encounter all those years ago. Because it’s while Arwen is out walking beneath the golden trees of her grandparent’s realm, that she and Aragorn are once again reunited. And because Aragorn is dressed in the fine raiment that Galadriel gave him, Arwen at first mistakes him for an “*Elf-lord from the Isles of the West.”*And so, it’s in this moment that Arwen makes the all-important choice that will decide not only her fate, but also the fate of the Dúnedain.

You see, for one whole season Aragorn and Arwen “*wandered together in the glades of Lothlórien.”* And on Midsummer’s Eve, Aragorn removed the Ring of Barahir from his finger, and he presented it to Arwen, as a symbol of their betrothal.

Now when Elrond learned of his daughter’s engagement, I think it’s fair to say he was somewhat conflicted, but he certainly didn’t blame Aragorn for Arwen’s choice. And thirty years after their original conversation about Aragorn’s love for his daughter, Elrond said to his adopted son “*though I love you, I say to you: Arwen Undómiel shall not diminish her life’s grace for…any Man less than the King of both Gondor and Arnor.”*

And so, with that sentence, Elrond set in motion the return of the King. To earn the love of Arwen Undómiel “*Aragorn went forth again to danger and toil.”* And the next time he crops up in the story is just after the eleventy-first birthday party of Bilbo Baggins. Now Aragorn does go on one more epic adventure to hunt down Gollum before showing up in Prancing Pony, but this pretty much catches us up with the Strider that we’re all familiar with from the Fellowship of the Ring.

So, let’s think back for a moment to those three heirlooms of Isildur’s. By the time of the Lord of the Rings, the Ring of Barahir belonged to Arwen, the Sceptre of Annúminas was kept by Elrond, and the reforged shards of Narsil were borne by Aragorn. Over the next three months, Aragorn undertook his second great journey from Rivendell to Gondor. And although he definitely took his sweet time in getting there, when Aragorn finally did arrive at Minas Tirith, aboard the Black Ships of the Corsairs, he brought hope (pun intended) to the Fields of Pelennor. Now I know in the movies Aragorn just kind of shows up with an Army of the Dead, but in Tolkien’s writings, the Oathbreakers had already served their purpose by then. Instead, Aragorn arrived at the battle with the twin sons of Elrond, a company of Rangers from the North, and an army of reinforcements from the Outlands of Gondor. Just as all hope seemed lost for the Men of the West, Aragorn unfurled the black and silver standard of Elendil and Isildur - a standard that had been stitched for him by Arwen - and he led his people to victory. He brought the sword that was broken to the City of Kings, and he revealed to Sauron that Isildur’s Heir had finally returned.

And only ten days later, Sauron was destroyed with the One Ring. Only forty-five days later, Aragorn was crowned king. And only three months later, Arwen and Elrond arrived in Minas Tirith where they beheld King Elessar for the first time. The three heirlooms of Isildur’s House were finally reunited.

At Aragorn‘s side lay Andúril. Upon Arwen’s finger sat the Ring of Barahir. And in Elrond’s hand was the Sceptre of Annúminas. So, on Midsummer’s Eve, thirty-nine years to the day since his daughter’s betrothal in Lothlórien, Elrond finally presented the Sceptre of Annúminas to his adopted son. And the very next day, Arwen married the High King of the Dúnedain.

So if we look back now to our original questions, how does a ranger become a king? I guess what the answer ultimately boils down to, is love. What did Aragorn have that his ancestors didn’t? Well, in terms of heritage and birthright and upbringing, they were all pretty much the same. But Aragorn had the love of Arwen. Aragorn earned her hand in marriage, and so for the sake of spending his life with the Elf-maiden he loved, Aragorn united the ancient Kingdoms of the Dúnedain, and he fulfilled his destiny as Isildur’s Heir.

For one hundred and twenty-two years, Aragorn ruled alongside his Queen, and together they founded a new dynasty for the Dúnedain that lasted long into the Fourth Age. And when his time finally did come, Aragorn walked the Silent Street of Minas Tirith, he lay down in his bed, and with his family at his side, he allowed himself to die. Arwen endured a single winter of grief without her husband, and she journeyed alone into the east until she came back to the now empty lands of Lothlórien. And there, she too “*laid herself to rest”,* and she joined her husband in death.

Throughout the Legendarium there are loads of kings. Some are great. Some are terrible. Some are in-between. But I would argue that there’s no other king in Middle-earth’s history who truly earns his right to rule in the same way that Aragorn does. He was born into a *“ragged house long bereft of lordship"",* but in the years between meeting Arwen, and eventually marrying her, Aragorn redeemed the House of Isildur, he united the Men of the West, and he ruled as the High King of all Dúnedain.

So, thank you all very much for reading this, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments on this amazing character. As some of you may know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos about Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

>  
>\- **The Farthest Shore**

Ursula K. Le Guin's career spanned over 60 years. She gave the world 20+ novels and 100+ short stories. Many people were first introduced to her work as children through the amazing world of Earthsea, following the wizard Ged. She was the first woman to win the Hugo and Nebula Awards for best novel with **The Left Hand of Darkness**. She was the second woman to be honored as a Grand Master of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. She also received huge acclaim outside the sff community, being named a living legend by the US Library of Congress in 2000, and winning the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 2014.

I came to her books late in life. As a teen my dad handed me his old, battered copy of **The Left Hand of Darkness** and I never read it because I didn't like the cover (sorry dad!). So I discovered her books in university and let them take me on a magical journey I never want to end. Every time I return to Earthsea I feel my heart stop, as the characters, the world, and prose sweeps me away. I still have many of her books to read, though my collection is slowly amassing.

In many ways her passing marked a shift, a great loss of a giant of classic sff. ""What now?"" I remember thinking, when I read the news. I think though, that as long as people read your books, a person is never truly gone. And I can see her influence in many of the contemporary authors being published today.

Today, I want to remember, celebrate her memory, the influence of her work. Share how her books impacted you, your favourite stories, and more.",Fantasy

I knew *of* Critical Role but had never read, watched, or listened to any of it. So, aside from knowing that this story was based off one of their early (earliest?) campaigns, I was going in blind.

And gottdang, I am really enjoying it. The characters are great, the plot is engaging, the fight scenes are cool AF, and I'm really digging the lore. I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about it after the first episode because I'm kinda tired of shows being too aware of themselves and making some sort of metacommentary on the thing that they are.

1622486247.0,"Kate Elliott on writing female characters: ""Get rid of the 'unknowable Other'""","Kate Elliott is, in my opinion, one of the most criminally underappreciated writers in SFF. *Black Wolves* probably ranks in my Top 5 Favorite Epic Fantasies of the 2010s, and I've been reading *Crown of Stars* (partly to console myself after *Black Wolves'* sequel was axed) with the utmost pleasure. Even *The Spiritwalker Trilogy*, while I had some issues with the romantic plot (>!no woman should ever live Happily Ever After with a man who has tried to murder her!<), is among my favorites.

But I believe that of all I've read of her work, the one I admire most is an essay entitled ""Writing Women Characters as Human Beings"": [https://www.tor.com/2015/03/04/writing-women-characters-as-human-beings/](https://www.tor.com/2015/03/04/writing-women-characters-as-human-beings/)

While the essay makes quite a few strong points, the one I can't get out of my head, as one of the most practical pieces of advice that too many people consistently fail to follow, is, ""Get rid of . . . the idea of an unknowable Other with a mysterious psychology."" This makes perfect sense to me, not only in writing characters but in living and relating to people in the real world. This is what I would have said in the ""Authors Who Can't Write Female Characters Can't Write Characters"" thread, if it hadn't been locked before I got to it.

Authors too often fail to write convincing characters, of one gender or another, because consciously or unconsciously they have too much invested in identifying those characters as ""not like me,"" and fixating on the traits that distinguish that character from themselves. They think of ""Women,"" or ""Men,"" as a plural, a group-mind that share a narrow selection of traits that are presumably rooted in their gender, rather than seeing the character of the gender different from themselves as a distinct individual with a personality that transcends stereotype. While I wouldn't go quite so far as to say that if they can't write characters of a different gender well or convincingly, that means they can't write characters *at all*, I would say it's a flaw that's worth talking about. It's also a dealbreaker for me as a reader. Nothing throws me out of a story faster than a sense of being ""Othered,"" so I avoid writers who have a well-documented reputation for writing female characters as an incomprehensible ""Them"" (as in ""Us"" vs. ""Them"").

I just wish there weren't so *many* fantasy writers with this kind of reputation. Gene Wolfe, Robert Jordan, Piers Anthony, R. Scott Bakker, Brent Weeks, Peter V. Brett, Patrick Rothfuss, Roger Zelazny, Terry Goodkind, David Gemmell, Jim Butcher, David Eddings, Brian McClelland (at least in the first Powder Mage Trilogy), Kevin Hearne (at least in the Iron Druid). That's not even counting classic SF writers like Azimov, Heinlein, Niven, etc. (I think the only man of that crowd that got it right was James Schmitz.) Then there are those *women* who struggle to write female characters convincingly, perhaps because they're more interested in crafting hyper-idealized portraits of awesome men (e.g. Stephenie Meyer, Kel Kade, Anne Rice). It makes me sigh to myself, *Are people like me really* ***that*** *hard to write?*

I also think maybe we don't talk enough about those who write *all* their characters well, without any subconscious Othering creeping in. A few who come to mind are Peter S. Beagle, Curtis Craddock, Django Wexler, Robert Jackson Bennett, Max Gladstone, as well as Robin Hobb, Elliott herself, Jen Williams, Sharon Shinn, Juliet Marillier, Naomi Novik.",Fantasy

1612398028.0,Dresden files. I didn't think i needed it until i started reading it or why palate cleansers are a big deal.,"I'm not that experienced fantasy reader, but 2020, for obvious reasons, was a perfect year to start.

In last 3 months of 2020 I've binged the entire ASOIAF, mistborn era 1, book of the ancestor, a lot of novels and non-fiction.

And now, after i finished book 3 of the wheel of time series, i was done. Burned out. I just didn't want to start book 4, another heavy trilogy or worse, stormlight archive, but that's what my tbr list is, basically.

And then i remembered that Dresden files exist and people say it's a good palate cleanser series.

To be honest, the concept of reading lighter books to refresh my brain after heavy books was completely foreign to me. What do you mean i can read something when I'm tired of reading to relax and keep reading?

But when i picked up storm front, it clicked. It feels so good. No huge info dumps, no 22 Jons where one of the main character's name is Jon, no huge worldbuilding terminology and vocabulary. And so on. Just read and enjoy.

I'm definitely not saying that Dresden files is dumb fantasy that serves no purpose but relaxation. But i appreciate now something simple, easy, a single pov.

I am now certain that it is a great idea to introduce in schools, because my god they love shoving huge and heavy pieces of classics one after another for 10 months straight.

What is your palate cleanser material? Do you feel that it's a necessity or i am a wuss?

1496505106.0,Why Del Rey and I will be parting ways,"My wife, Robin, was doing some preparation work for contract negotiations with Del Rey for:

* The last two books in the Legends of the First Empire series
* The first book in a new series which falls between First Empire and Legends.

Turns out the negotiations are dead even before they started, and since I often talk about the ""publishing side of business"" here. I thought I would share what is going on.

So a few things to know before we get started.

* Del Rey's deal for the first three books of Legends of the First Empire (and one yet to be named book in Elan) was something I was (and am) extremely pleased about. Publisher's Weekly ranks deals in a number of categories the top being a ""Major Deal"" (which kicks in at $500,000 and the 4-book ebook/print deal would fall in there). I feel that the offer showed them to be a fan of a work and respected what I was capable of.

* Age of Myth (book #1) has done extremely well. We haven't yet hit the 1 year mark and already it has sold just a bit shy of 115,000 copies in the English language. It surpassed its thresholds for the hardcover ""escalators"" (if you don't know what that is, I'll talk about it in the comments if you ask). It also has incredible ratings (14,850) with 89.3% in the 4- & 5-star range, 8.4% with 3-star, and only 2.3% with 1- & 2-star.  It also was a Goodreads Choice Award Nominee, picked by Amazon, Audible, and AudioFile Magazine as one of the Best Fantasy books of 2016,  not to mention hitting several other notable bloggers' best-of lists.

* I couldn't be happier with how Del Rey has treated me, and there have been no conflicts with ""creative differences,"" missed deadlines, or other issues that tend to derail authors' careers.

So what's the problem?

We are in a catch-22 because both of us see the audio rights as extremely valuable and refuse to let them go. To give you a little background, I always try to limit the rights transferred in the primary contract. This is why I only do ""World English"" or ""North American English"" and attempt to reserve my audio rights.

When The Riyria Revelations contract was negotiated I asked my agent to retain the audio rights, she said it was a ""deal breaker"" for them so I caved.  Same thing happened with The Riyria Chronicles.  Orbit ended up selling that right to Recorded Books (a  transaction that at it's most took them 10 - 15 hour to do) and the result is that I've had to split more than $145,000 with them 50/50. Not only that, but Recorded Books recently renewed the contract for those books for $400,000 and you guessed it. I only get $200,000 of that money. That kind of ""hit"" hurts...greatly.

Okay, so when it came to the Legends of the First Empire books Robin decided to sell the audio rights first.  That way they would be ""off the table"" and we'd not have to split the profits with anyone. We sold the first 4 books to Recorded books for what PW would term as a ""good deal"" ($100,000 - $250,000). 

Getting just the ebook & print for the English language wasn't a problem for Del Rey and so every one was happy.

Now, then, we've heard rumblings that publishers are cracking down on requiring audio rights, but that they are also not willing to increase the advances to account for having them. It was important to find out what the value of these were so we could make informed decisions so we started shopping the various books I have ""in the works"" to a number of audio publishers and found out...they're worth a lot.  Like 7-figures for thee books a lot. That's MUCH, MUCH more than my first ""major deal"" (and it was my first 7-figure deal ever). So...I signed up the books, as it provided me a level of stability that is hard to come by in this business. I did so knowing full well that it might jeopardize the print and ebook versions. But it was, as they say making me ""a deal I couldn't refuse.""

Okay, so back to Robin setting the stage for books I've yet to sign for print/ebook which are:

* The last three books of the Legends of the First Empire
* Three books in a new series ""Empire Falls""

She wanted to make sure Del Rey realized that the audio books were sold, so they knew what they could have and what they couldn't -- basically the same as the last contract.  As you might have guessed, the response came back that the CEO at Penguin Random House has made a corporate wide decree that states, that editors with their imprints (including Del Rey) are ""absolutely, and with no exceptions, forbidden to strike deals anymore that do not include audio rights.""

Now, do I really think there are ""absolutely no exceptions""? No. If Rowling or Stephen King wanted to keep their audio rights, I'm sure they would be able to. Likewise, if an author is selling very little in audio, I'm sure they wouldn't care if they were kept. But I seem to be in that spot where I'm not ""big enough"" to waive audio and my audio sales are too large for them to ignore. 

And, so that, as they say is that.

So, what does all that mean for my books going forward?  Not too terribly much. I wouldn't have made that gamble without other alternatives. It could be that there are other fantasy publishers that will pick me up without audio rights (Orbit and Del Rey are definitely out), but even if they don't I have a strong record of producing high-quality self-published books. My sales may be lower (due to lack of bookstore exposure) but you'll still be able to get the books (a) directly from me or  (b) from on-line retailers.  Also, you may not be able to find the books in the library, but maybe I'll start my own ""lending program"" for people who want to go that way.   No worries, books will still be coming out, but I may need to do some regrouping as we explore the various opportunities.

Anyway, this may be of absolutely no interested to anyone. But I thought getting it ""out there"" would help assuage any rumors that Del Rey and I are breaking because of a conflict of any kind, or because of low sales with my books. It's ironic. We (I and Del Rey) both want to continue working together, both are finding financial benefit from the arrangement and yet we can't keep doing what we've been doing. It's a crazy business!",Fantasy

1593368118.0,I owe an apology to the great Brandon Sanderson,"Back in the day teenage me had beef with Sanderson and refused to read any of his works. Why the vendetta you ask? Well I am also a fan of the Wheel of Time series. I vividly recall reading an advertisement for one of Sanderson books and was shocked to see the ad read, “From the author of Wheel of Time.” I was incensed, how dare he ride on Robert Jordan’s coat tails when he only helped finish the last book! From that day forward, I vowed to never pick up one of his novels.

Fast forward to quarantine, audible was having a sale and I grudgingly picked out a Skyward because so many users on r/fantasy raved about him. All I can say I was wrong, woeful misguided and I regret not reading him sooner.

Not since Tamara Pierce have I seen such a strong, well written female heroine. I absolutely love his writing style; how he can intermix comedy and drama so I’m laughing, crying and yelling one moment to the next. His world building was immersive and not the same rehash of old fantasy/sci-fi tropes. Usually I take my time with audio books, but I couldn’t stop listening and burned through a 15 hour audio book in 2 days.

So here I am. Brandon Sanderson I apologize for my initial judgment. I judged a book by a single cover and paid the price of my arrogance. I will pay penance by doing a deep dive into your works. Where should I start fellow fantasy readers?

[Serious Guardians of the Galaxy energy.](https://preview.redd.it/70mvioakfwoa1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6bcc724c9a785374df7e8328070b5f6fc02825e)

DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS: HONOR AMONG THIEVES made me tear up a bit at  the end. It was an involuntary reaction, I certainly didn’t intend for  it to happen, but it’s something that occurred nevertheless. Against my  better judgement, I came to care about these characters and whether they  managed to make it through the end of the movie. So, in the words of *Rick and Morty*, “You son of a bitch, I’m in.”

The movie isn’t perfect by any stretch of the imagination but it is recognizably and explicitly *Dungeons and Dragons*. Which is a harder thing to embody than many people might think. *Dungeons and Dragons*  isn’t a setting by itself but a method of creating and playing a  setting. This is the problem of previous adaptations because you can  play any fantasy setting with D&D rules but you can’t just say, “*Dungeons and Dragons* is the setting.” Here, it’s the *Forgotten Realms* and I kind of wish they’d called it *Forgotten Realms* or *Neverwinter Nights* because either of those titles would have been appropriate as well.

Energy-wise, this is a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie for better and worse. I honestly compare this most to Paul Rudd’s *Ant Man*  movie in terms of rough mixture between family melodrama, quips, and  action. Well, this has a lot more dragons in it and I’ll give that is an  impressive boost over *Ant Man*. It’s a movie about a failed  father trying to reconnect with his daughter, a heist, and an oddball  crew of misfits. So let’s say *Ant Man* meets *Guardians of the Galaxy*  meets dragons. Which, yes, is probably why I love this movie against my  better judgement. Neither of those films are my favorite Marvel films  but throw in an owlbear and the Red Wizards of Thay? Yeah, now we’re  cooking with fireballs.

The premise is somewhat overly complicated at the start with,  essentially, an entire movie’s worth of backstory in the prologue that  could have been the first part of a trilogy. Edgin Darvis (Chris Pine)  is a Harper who turns to thievery after his do-goodery gets his wife  killed by the Red Wizards. He ends up as heterosexual but platonic  partners with Holga (Michelle Rodriguez) and raises his daughter, Kira,  with her.

Hearing there’s a magical tablet that can raise his wife from the  dead, Edgin robs the Harpers and gets sent to magical prison with Holga  when the heist goes wrong. They break out and decide to get Kira back  from their partner who, obviously, betrayed them but is raising the girl  as his own.

This is just the prologue.

The movie is mostly a heist film with our leads recruiting bumbling  sorcerer Simon Aumar (Justice Smith) and kickass Tiefling druid Doric  (Sophia Lillis) to help take down Lord Forge Fitzwilliam (Hugh Grant) as  well as his Red Wizard partner Sofina (Daisy Head). They go from action  scene and comedy scene to action scene to comedy scene with the movie  never really taking a break. Some of the comedy is stupid like a scene  where they waste their Speak with the Dead questions while other comedy  is stupid but entertaining as hell (Holga’s ex being a halfling? Eh.  Holga’s ex taking up with another Amazonian barbarian? HILARIOUS).

The movie is utterly drenched with fanservice and you’ll be unable to  turn off your brain from the, “I recognize that, they said the thing, I  recognize that, reference to that thing I know!” Memberberries (i.e.  things you remember from your childhood) are a pretty low form of humor  perfected by *Buffy: The Vampire Slay*er and *Iron Man*  but it works on the nerd side of my brain. When they mention Simon is  Elminster’s descendant, I went, “Yeah, him and half of Faerun” and  realized they’d gotten me.

&#x200B;

[Sophia is delightful in this movie even if I confused her for Keylith.](https://preview.redd.it/7jtso5jnfwoa1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a059b53977c44ceaaab51b1eee6b2e0258e03886)

I almost feel bad about how mad I am for unabashedly loving this  movie. I am deeply cynical about Hasbro’s handling of D&D and mad at  them for a dozen things ranging from the OGL to the novels being  abandoned. However, this movie has an morbidly obese red dragon, the  cast of the Eighties *Dungeons and Dragons* cartoon, and Szass  Frigging Tam (who is the villain of my current D&D campaign). What  am I supposed to do with that? I can’t stay mad at a movie trying this  hard to entertain me.

The cast is a bunch of bumbling misfits and everyone looks like an  idiot but Doric (Michelle Rodriguez gets a lot of mileage out of being a  dumb barbarian), yet I can’t complain about that since it’s my style of  humor too. They’re also competent when it counts. I even like Hugh  Grant in this as he basically shows what he would have been like if he’d  play Gilderoy Lockhart in *Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets*.  Literally my only complaints are the fact that I wasn’t aware Faerun  was enlightened enough to have prisons with a healthy pardon system and  the fact movie dragged in literally two places.

1663009888.0,A critique of sexual violence in Fantasy.,"Oftentimes I see people defend several aspects regarding the treatment of women in fantasy books and media by saying ‘that’s how things were’. 

Most times this is false. I have tried to break down the argument into two main sections so I can explain how common perceptions were false. Notably, I only know about European history.

Sexual Assault

Quite a few fantasy books contain sexual assault toward women. I am not going to deny that it happened, as rape, particularly wartime rape did and still does occur. However, Rape in the past was little more prevalent than during modern times. Similarly, rape in the past was often punished, usually much harsher than in modern times. Additionally, Men were often raped at levels similar to women.
In fantasy books, the latter two are often ignored. Most times rape seems to be treated as normal, rather than punished. Additionally, rape seems to be targeted almost exclusively at women.

The first edict against wartime sexual assault was the Cáin Adomnáin. Notably, it was issued in the British Isles and had little influence outside of north western Europe. It explicitly forbade, among other things, raping and killing women. For these crimes it declares of the perpetrator,” his right hand and his left foot shall be cut off before death, and then he shall die."" [1]

The first Europe-wide treaty forbidding rape was the Peace and Truth of God, which was issued in 989 before spreading over Europe over the next century. The first king to accept it was King Robert II of France. Following his acceptance other nobles accepted the Peace and Truth of God in droves. It should be noted that in those times the military was almost entirely comprised of nobles. In Britain, it was standard for the first son to be the heir, the second to join the military, and any subsequent sons to join the monastery to prevent inheritance disputes. It wasn’t until Napoleon that large scale armies became the norm. Slowly, the ideas blended in with general chivalry.

By the time of the 1300’s wartime rape and sexual violence was prosecuted for hindering military operations rather than just for “property crimes” (Since Women were considered the property of either their husband or father). It didn’t take much effort to realise that raping people created a hostile civilian population and having a hostile population would make it far harder to occupy and control territory.  The general line of thought was that when defeating an enemy, treat them so kindly that they would not seek revenge, or treat them so harshly that they could not attain their revenge. [2]

The final major declaration against wartime sexual violence in the medieval era was the De jure belli as pacis, written in 1625. Similar to all previous works, it declared that wartime rape was no less reprehensible than rape during peace time. Notably, this work states that the rules were still valid “even when God were assumed not to exist” [3]

A common argument against this would be that, despite rape and sexual violence being prohibited, soldiers would ignore the laws. In reality that would be true, but there is no evidence to suggest that it happened at greater levels than in the modern time.
The Geneva convention clearly prohibited wartime rape. Despite that, during WW2 soviet soldiers used the system of “from 8 to 80” when deciding to rape women, leading to over two million German women getting raped. [4]

In the present time, 26,000 women have been raped so far in the ongoing Tigray war. In contrast with Fantasy books, novels regarding modern wars usually omit the sexual violence. For those that include it, It is often brief and undescriptive.

Additionally, fantasy books usually only include sexual assault towards women. In reality, both men and women were and are raped in war. During the El Salvadorian dictatorship, 76% of male political prisoners were raped. In the Yugoslav wars, 80% of men in the Sarajevo concentration camp were raped. Even more recent, 22% of men and 30% of women fleeing the eastern Congo reported being raped. [5]

Essentially, saying that’s how things were ignored the reality of the situation. Oftentimes it is only used in defence of the ill-treatment of women while ignoring other aspects of the time.

Young Marriage

Another common misconception is that women would often get married young, sometimes even as children. In reality, the average age for Women was 22.4 and for Men it was 25.9 [6]. Additionally, between 10% and 25% of Women never married [7]. Couples would often delay marriage depending on their economic circumstances. The only notable exception was during the black death when couples would get married as teenagers due to the immense labour shortage. By 1140, the Decretum Gratiani was issued. This stated that the binds of marriage were to be formed by mutual consent and granted Women an equal say in marriage.

Despite this, some noble families would get married young. This was usually in order to secure the future of the family. However, noble families would prevent their children from consummating their marriage until women usually hit the age of 16. The main reason being that they did not want to endanger the health of the women. After all, despite lacking modern medicine it was still common sense that a girl getting pregnant would not only result in a still birth, but would also endanger her health, preventing any future offspring.

1624511987.0,"Why do some authors come across as more poetic? I did a prose analysis of Tolkien, Sanderson, Rothfuss, Jemisin, and Erikson. Here's what I learned","I was looking into prose styles for a video I made recently, and found some interesting stuff. I pulled two paragraphs each from Tolkien, Sanderson, Rothfuss, Jemisin, and Erikson, and analyzed them for a few things. The paragraphs I pulled were descriptive -- no dialogue, no action scenes -- since I figured those would best represent the author's voice unmixed with characters' voices.

I looked at three key areas: 1) average sentence length, 2) adj/adv usage, and 3) Germanic vs Latinate word usage. (To be clear, I wasn't being exhaustive or even super academic. Just testing to see if I want to dig further. In the future I'll look at sentence structure and punctuation usage, among other things.)

Here's a visual rundown of how the numbers shook out:

[https://imgur.com/a/bnNAH2B](https://imgur.com/a/bnNAH2B)

Here's what I learned:

* Tolkien and Rothfuss are both super heavy on Germanic words. I think their word choice gives them a deliberate, poetic feel.
* On the other hand, where Tolkien uses tons of modifiers -- adjectives and adverbs -- Rothfuss keeps those to a minimum.
* Sanderson uses a comparatively high number of Latinate words. Like, outrageously high. At least, it seems that way until you realize how high our day-to-day usage of Latinates is in spoken English. I think this makes Sanderson's prose much more casual, which some like and others find unremarkable or even poor.
* Jemisin fell in the middle of the pack in terms of Latinates and modifiers. She has a distinct style from the others, but I think cracking her code will lie elsewhere in a different analysis.
* Erikson had the longest sentence length, with Sandersonian levels of Latinate words. I know the least about his writing out of the group, so I'm not sure yet what to make of it. Frustrating to a certain audience, I would assume?

I go into more detail, and read from a couple of the samples, [in this video](https://youtu.be/yGtVPRnFi_s). If you enjoy it and have other ideas for how to quantify prose style, let me know.

I absolutely fell in love with the book and picked up new ones as they came out. 

In 2005, around the time The Opal Deception came out, I started a little fan website for the book series as there wasn't anything particularly out there, and as a frequent MuggleNet visitor I wanted in on the action! I learned how to code and developed an interest in website design and development.

I forced my dad to take me to various Eoin Colfer signings, and I wrote him the odd letter and did my best keeping the site filled with news, and the forum filled with users and discussion. Over the years I've met Eoin a fair few times - [dat aging](https://i.imgur.com/3t4Hb9x.jpg).

As a kid growing up and going through school, I was originally wanting to go into journalism, however my interest in website design and development from managing the Artemis Fowl fansite convinced me to go to University to study a mixture of technology and business, and now I own my own business, developing websites for clients, along with graphic design and marketing!

Over the years I've been to book launch parties, signings, events and all sorts - but that pales in comparison to a fortnight ago. I found myself interviewing Eoin Colfer in a studio to talk about the new Fowl spin-off series - THE FOWL TWINS - and we've [just published the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8YsjaNv7Q0)! Even after all these years and challenges faced, this was somehow one of the most daunting yet exciting experiences of my life. I think I managed to keep reasonably cool but what you don't see in the video is me blanking and having to check notes after every question or so in the first 10 minutes of the interview!

Not only do I at least partially owe my career to the Artemis Fowl series & Eoin Colfer - but when I lost my dad completely out of the blue a good few years back, managing the website in my free time around working was one of the things that kept me going completely off the deep-end.

I know people the world over have gone on life journeys and experiences as a result of a book or series, but I just wanted to share mine.

1609163212.0,"James E. Gunn, 1923-2020","This Saturday, James E. Gunn, the last living Golden Age science fiction author (no, not the director), passed away of congestive heart failure at age 97.

I had the good fortune to take a couple of science fiction classes with Gunn at the University of Kansas a bit over a decade ago, and I can honestly say I wouldn't be the author I am today without his influence. He introduced me to countless classic authors I wouldn't have read otherwise, and exposed me to the fascinating history of science fiction and fantasy. In the first class I took with him, during the summer semester of my freshman year of college, I met the first girl I ever kissed (I was a late bloomer, don't judge me), as well as one of my closest lifelong friends, who I actually served as a groomsman for at his wedding a few years ago. (The three of us actually led a discussion group for China Mieville's *Perdido Street Station* and Iain M. Banks' *Consider Phlebas-* students took turns in groups leading discussions for each of the 25 books read for the class.)

Gunn's influence on my life was vastly disproportionate to the time I spent learning from him. I honestly don't know if I would have been the author I am today without his influence. I would be surprised if Gunn remembered me- it's been years since we've spoken, and I was just one more among countless thousands of students that he taught. I do have friends who were close to him, and the impact his loss has had on them is immense- Gunn was deeply beloved by those around him.

He frequently had stories of interacting with Heinlein, Asimov, and countless other speculative fiction greats. One of my favorite anecdotes he told our class involved him sitting with Phillip K. Dick at an award show. When he asked Dick what he'd been up to lately, Dick's response was ""Graffiti, mostly.""

Without Gunn, there wouldn't have been much of a study of science fiction and fantasy's history. In 1968, he founded the Center for the Study of Science Fiction at the University of Kansas, the first ever university program of its sort. It led to the establishment of science fiction courses and studies at universities around the world, many of which it directly helped establish. The Center for the Study of Science Fiction is still around today, and is also in charge of giving out the Campbell and Sturgeon Awards. Gunn also put together *The Road to Science Fiction*, a combination history of the genre/ anthology of representative short stories and excerpts for each era, dating all the way back to Gilgamesh. The Road to Science Fiction is absolutely a must-read for anyone studying the history of speculative fiction.

Gunn was a prolific science fiction writer over the years. He sold the first short story he ever wrote (which is kinda terrifying) in 1948, and continued putting out books and short stories for his entire life. He wrote 28 books and edited 18 during his career, and his most recent trilogy of novels came out over this last decade. His writing spans not only many decades, but many shifts in artistic tradition as well. Gunn didn't just stick to Golden Age style science fiction, but attempted (and usually succeeded) in writing in many of the various literary trends and movements that passed through the genre over the 20th century, including the New Wave and hard SF. One of his most notable works is *The Listeners,* the novel widely credited with inspiring SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Life, as well as Carl Sagan's *Contact.*

Another well-known aspect of it is that Generic Fantasy Dwarves usually live underground and in mountainous regions, in vast halls that were old before Generic Fantasy Elves sang their first poem about moonlight or stars or trees or bees or something boring like that. 

You may recognize this as an environment that is not ideal for growing barley. Of course, Generic Fantasy Dwarves could trade with Humans for barley in exchange for Superior Generic Fantasy Dwarven Craftmanship, but can you trust the produce of those shifty Humans? No you cannot! I mean, come on - they are basically round-eared, short-lived *Elves*, for Moradin's sake!

Also, as we all know, Generic Fantasy Dwarven kingdoms were vast and deep well before  Humans learned which end to poop out of, so Authentic Generic Fantasy Dwarven Beer cannot have originally relied on trade with humans. 

Now, do you know what crop is fairly well-suited to mountain soil? You guessed it, carrots - and they grow underground too, and they have a beard*, so basically they are honorary Generic Fantasy Dwarves themselves. 

And can you make something alcoholic out of them? [Of course!](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=carrot+wine&t=h_&ia=recipes)

All recipes I can find require to add extra sugar (carrots are somewhat sugary, but apparently not enough to easily get some serious fermentation going on their own); but Generic Fantasy Dwarves could obtain this sugar from beets, for example, that also grow underground and are more Generic Fantasy Dwarvish than bloody *barley*. 

So there you have it. I have made my case, and I think that it is pretty solid: Generic Fantasy Dwarven Beer is carrot wine.

-A pretty decent worldbuilding, the one needed for the storie but it could be expanded a lot.

-A lot of emotional moments without feeling like you're being manipulated by the author.

-A perfect hard magic system that regardless of being based of ancient chemistry, it doesn't feel like pseudoscience (Take a note, Sando) and it's pretty dynamic.

-Action packed battles where you don't know who's gonna win, even ""muggles"" have chances against alchemists or immortal monsters, it's not about who's stronger, it's about who have the better strategy.

-Phyloshical themes like what is a human, what is truth, what's the point of the war and things like that.

-Not medieval setting, don't get me wrong, I love medieval fantasy but having a breath of that kind of scenario is always good (and not very common in high fantasy).


**PLUS***

-The art of the manga is very unique, thank God it doesn't have the typical super slim anime style (or super muscular).

-The music of both adaptations is beautiful.


A negative point about the manga is the sense of humor of the author, maybe is too japanese for me and the most bothering thing is when the characters start joking in a serious moment but besides that, I can't complain about any other thing. I think this universe have a lot of potential to many stories and even being adapted by Hollywood to become the new Harry Potter (but a lot better) and I know there's already a japanese live action movie (and two more on the way) but this are fucking horrible.

What do you guys think? Have you ever read it or seen it one of the adaptations?",Fantasy

1630934481.0,"To Celebrate My Birthday, Have Some Free Kindle Progression Fantasy Books!","Hey all,

To celebrate my birthday, I'm running a free book promotion on a couple of my titles.

First is [**Sufficiently Advanced Magic**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XBFD7CB/), my most popular book and the first in my **Arcane Ascension** series. **Sufficiently Advanced Magic** is a JRPG inspired progression fantasy novel. Our protagonist, Corin Cadence, seeks to learn magic and ascend through a titanic tower to discover the fate of his brother, who disappeared into the tower five years earlier. The series has a mixture of magical academy content focusing on learning magic and dungeon crawling sections in the tower (and other dangerous locales). It takes place in the same setting as two of my other series, but this is the most popular place to start reading my books. If you enjoy JRPGs like **Final Fantasy**, **Fire Emblem**, **Trails**, **SaGa**, etc. you might like this one.

&#x200B;

[Sufficiently Advanced Magic](https://preview.redd.it/tqfqbbvhvvl71.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=421a5ae8803cec7424feadd3a95abb4dc6fbd40c)

&#x200B;

The next free title is [**How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08F3RTTKM/), my comedic love letter to games like **Zelda** and **Dragon Quest**. In this world, there is a cycle: every hundred years the Demon King rises and seeks to conquer the world. A hundred years thereafter, the Hero is reborn and defeats the Demon King. Yui Shaw is born into a world under the Demon King's onslaught - and she's not willing to wait for a legendary Hero to rise. She'll find a way to win without the power of prophecy. This is much more of a parody than my other books, and it's also a novella, whereas **Sufficiently Advanced Magic** is a door stopper-length novel. So, if you want a quicker taste of my style before jumping into massive works, this is a good option.

I'll also quickly note that [**Six Sacred Swords**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07NKBSZGF/) is currently under Prime Reading, and thus, available free for people with Prime Reading. That's not a special thing for today, but it's another potentially free book, so I figured it was still worth mentioning. This one is more of a flashy action-focused story with a protagonist that is powerful from the start. Like my other books, it's heavily inspired by JRPGs, but this one leans more into the action RPG style - think **Ys** or **Tales**. If you like sword-wielding heroes, talking swords, and bibliophile dragons, consider checking this one out. Note that this is not free for everyone - this on is specifically a Prime Reading deal.

1357751993.0,I'm fantasy author Patrick Rothfuss - AMA,"Heya everybody, I'm Patrick Rothfuss.

I'm a fantasy author.

I'm a father. My son is three.

[I have a show about writing on Felicia Day's Youtube Channel: Geek and Sundry](http://geekandsundry.com/)

I also run a [charity called Worldbuilders.](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2012/11/worldbuilders-2012/) Over the last four years we've raised over 1.5 million dollars for Heifer International.

[Here are some guidelines based off the Machine Gun Q&A sessions I run on my blog.](http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/category/machine-gun-qa/)

1. You can ask any question.

2. Bite-sized questions are best. I'd rather answer 80 questions instead of spending all my time writing up 3-4 long, detailed answers and having to ignore everyone else as a result.

3. One question per comment is best. It's just simpler and easier that way. It's going to be hard for me to write a carefully structured essay answering your five-part question.

4. I reserve the right to lie, make jokes, or ignore your question.

  4b. If I ignore your question, it’s not because I hate you. It’s probably just because I don’t have anything witty to say on the subject.

5. I reserve the right to be honest, snarky, or flippant. Either consecutively or concurrently.

6. I won’t answer spoiler-ish questions about the books.

**I will be back at 8PM Central to answer questions.**


**[Edit at 10:15 PM:] Merciful Buddha. I thought I was getting to the end of the list, when it turns out I was just getting to the end of the first 500 comments. I'll stop back tomorrow and take another quick poke through things, and answer a few more questions. But for now, I've used up all my words. I need to get a little nap in, then do some more writing tonight. Thanks for a great time everybody.**

1699287554.0,Fantasy Romance is STILL Fantasy,"I feel like there has been SO MUCH pretentiousness from fantasy fans about fantasy romance and goddamn that shit is annoying. Just because the idea of sex or sexual desire in fantasy novels scares you, doesn't mean it is not real fantasy.

Average writing in a book does not make it not fantasy, hell, Sanderson is one of the most successful fantasy writers of our generation and his writing is no Tolkien thats for sure (as a massive Sanderson fan). There are plenty of male authors that constantly write descriptions of womens boobs, clothes, and figures as well as dudes wanting to have sex with every woman they see and somehow that is all fine since its from a man (Robert Jordan, Brent Weeks, Jim Butcher -- I could give so many examples but you know what many books I am talking about). But god forbid a woman wants to have sex and displays sexual desire and it is all ""shitty writing"" and ""no world building"" since the world and magic system isn't info dumped on you for 15 pages straight.

Thank a little more critically why you are so quick to dismiss books like Fourth Wing or ACOTAR as valid fantasy. **If you don't like it, cool -- no one is forcing you to read it.** Things like booktok have quote literally made hundreds of thousands of people pick up books and fantasy because they promote accessible writing. Just because you didn't do your research and now are frazzled reading sexual desire from a woman doesn't mean it is not fantasy. Just because a book is FUN, does not mean its not real fantasy.

Edit: Lots of the comments seem to come from people who have not read any fantasy romance and think it ONLY sex in a fantasy setting which is not the case. Some are like that but the majority of ones that are popular and that I have read are not. Fantasy genre has evolved from farm boy searches for magical object but somehow fantasy romance can't be included? When you mention what you think fantasy romance is, give an example of that, if that does not apply to all fantasy romance novels -- perhaps it is not a monolith like you think!

*You can disagree but the fact is that books that are popular with male audiences are critically acclaimed real fantasy even if they devote the same amount of page time to romance but books popular with female audiences are dismissed as romance or guilty pleasures even if they evoke the same level of emotion from people.* 

If you have a preference against romance, grim dark, etc, do your due diligence and read a review or two to see if it is the right fit for you or not -- and don't blame it on the people who enjoy the books.",Fantasy
1617463384.0,Just finished the Realm of the Elderlings saga. You can't convince me that Robin Hobb isn't the greatest living fantasy writer right now,"
Just finished Assassin’s Fate, the final book in Robin Hobb’s 16-book Realm of the Elderlings saga. To say that I’m floored would be understating it. Pretty convinced that I just read the greatest fantasy ever written and it’ll be hard for anything in the genre to top it. I’m not an emotional person but holy shit I feel like my heart has been ripped out of my chest.


I won’t go too much into the story or characters but just more wanted to share my feelings. Really feeling like I just spent a lifetime with these people, these characters that came to mean so much to me.


Has anyone achieved this kind of depth, poignancy and complexity when it comes to characters in fantasy? I really can’t think of another series or standalone novel that has. Following Fitz’s journey from a child to an old man was a transcendent experience. I felt like I lived his entire lifetime with him, with every single high and low – and boy, there are so, so, so many crushing lows.


I could spend pages talking about the growth in characters like Fitz, the Fool, Malta, Wintrow, etc etc but I think it’s better to experience it for yourself. The worldbuilding is incredible as well, especially because just how low-key and inconspicuous it is. It just slowly grows organically over each book until the Five Duchies feel like one of the most well-realized settings in the genre.


Hobb’s prose is amazing throughout. It’s not showy, but it has an evocative melancholy and simple elegance to it. Almost fairy-tale like at times, very warm and comforting.


But above all, it’s the people that really make this saga. This is the very definition of “character-driven” storytelling. There’s no plot and no story without the decisions and actions taken by these characters, and consequences are wide and far-reaching. The books aren’t always easy reads – Hobb takes her characters through the emotional and mental wringer again and again and again. But that’s what’s most remarkable about it. It’s a look at just how much you can take at what life throws at you and still keep going.


Just an absolute masterclass in storytelling and writing. I would put RotE up there with some of the best literary classics I’ve read. ",Fantasy
1617203645.0,"I decided to check out Unsouled (book one of the Cradle series) by Will Wight on a whim, and six days later I've binged all eight books published so far.","I've been trying to find a decent xianxia series for a while now. Already found some really good wuxia-level stories like The Breaker, Legend of the Northern Blade and Blood and Steel, but xianxia always seemed to centre around really unlikeable protagonists in a story that made no sense whatsoever.

Enter Will Wight's Cradle series. The first book was just 89 cents on amazon, and 294 pages, so it thought it worth checking out, especially with the myriad positive reviews I'd come across. I thought I'd read it and see if I wanted to add the rest of the series to my list.

It SUCKED ME IN. I read the first book. Then I read the second book. Then I realised I was screwed. Goodbye all my plans for the week.

Don't get me wrong, it's not High Literature. And while funny it's no Pratchett.

What it is, is pure literary cocaine. I couldn't stop. I had to find out what happened next. Wight grabbed me by the scalp and shoved my face through the screen. Yes, the power fantasy aspect can get a bit exhausting, especially when binging, but it becomes a lot more tolerable thanks to the fact that the male protagonist isn't an unlikeable jerk like so many xianxia protagonists. He's a really sweet guy who simply suffers from an unfortunate case of resting ""I will murder you as a warning to your family"" face, which combined with his imposing build gives entirely the wrong impression to people he meets for the first time.

And the female protagonist is allowed to shine! Repeatedly! Even up to the latest published book! This ain't no case of ""Sakura falls hopelessly behind Naruto and Sasuke."" As a matter of fact she's way stronger than the male protagonist in the beginning, and while he does a lot of catching up she's still a notch above him, and Wight shows it to us too.

Also no harem! Nary a hint. Which I don't mind telling you is mighty refreshing.

There's a lot more I could mention, but right now my eyes are hurting and I really need some sunlight, so I'll finish by telling you that one of the male protagonist's mentor figures is a giant firebreathing kung fu turtle. If you don't find that appealing then I don't know what to say.

1613580909.0,Why are most mothers in fantasy dead or absent?,"I remember George R. R. Martin saying he created Catelyn Tully because he noticed that if the characters in most fantasy stories weren't complete orphans their mothers were dead or absent. He didn't want to follow that cliché and he made a strong mother character that has a prominent role in the story. 

Then I noticed that he was right: in most cases the mother is not present in the story. She is either dead before the story starts or dies before the second act. In best case she is kidnapped (Percy Jackson uses this) and the hero has to save her. And in a rare case the mother doesn't care about her child and abandons her/him (Once Upon a Time loves parental abandonment trope very much). Other than that when the hero speaks of her/his parents, she/he mostly talks about the dad and the dad often plays an important role in the story. The mum is rarely mentioned.

Why does this happen? Do fantasy writers actually dislike mother characters?

1626234377.0,Pouting and sulking in The Wheel of Time. Childish behaviors in female characters- data and observations.,"Did I probably spend way too much time on this weirdly specific topic? Yup.

Firstly, I LOVE this series, so this is definitely not meant to be a ""Robert Jordan can't write women"" post. Several of the women are some of my favorite characters ever. That being said, I have issues with some of the gendered stuff (as most people do) and one of the things I noticed while reading was that Jordan repeated certain expressions a lot; an example of this being the pouting and sulking. These are not completely exclusive to children of course, but when I think of ""pouting"" I imagine a toddler sticking their lower lip out and preparing to throw a tantrum or being childishly upset and ""sulking"" is usually an immature/childish descriptor, as opposed to ""annoyed"" or ""angry."" I've personally only ever heard someone use the word ""sulking"" in regards to children. If you Google Image these words it's photos of children. 

So, because I had already noticed this while reading, I searched all 14 books on my Kindle for every instance of pouting and sulking. I'm sure there are other similar descriptors I could do this for, but this will be long enough as it is. 

Yes, I'm listing them all because I assumed some people might try saying I'm exaggerating or making too much out of it.

***I actually want to highlight this particular little exchange because Jordan does this thing a lot:***

&gt;*Wrapping her arms around herself, Elayne scowled. “Stop sulking, sister,” Aviendha said. She pointed down to one of the stableyards... The familiar vertical slash of light appeared in the stableyard and rotated into a hole in the air ten feet tall and as wide. Elayne scowled down at Reanne’s head. She was *not* sulking.*

***One character will tell another to stop sulking and that character will internally  have a petulant defensive reaction like ""I'm not sulking!"" which strikes me as  very childish/immature. Also, the text says Elayne ""scowled"" but Aviendha calls it ""sulking"" which seems like a way to diminish valid anger, and this type of interaction happens several times over the series.***

- Carlinya (""“Don’t sulk, Carlinya."")
- Tiana (""made her look sulky."")

***I want to highlight this bit as well. Egwene herself recognizes that her very valid frustration/anger might be dismissed as childish sulking.

Sulking: 0


##**CONCLUSIONS:**

31 counts of pouting, of which only 1 is directly male. 

74 counts of sulking, of which 13 are male, 2 of which are a small boy. 

1. It appears that for Jordan, or in the way Jordan was choosing to write these characters in this world, mannerisms that we would label as childish like pouting and sulking are very *female* mannerisms. 

2. A couple other instances of very childish behavior is a mention of Nynaeve's ""tantrums"" and Elayne thinking she might stick her tongue out. These are things we might associate with a five year old and they're being associated with a grown woman, including a grown woman who has a legitimate anger block in her magic ability. 

3. This is a Jordan-ism. When Sanderson takes over there are only 4 mentions of these expressions in all three books, and I've yet to encounter another author who writes grown women as pouting and sulking so much. 

4. Jordan goes out of his way to remind you repeatedly that certain characters pout and sulk, such as Amathera and Alanna. For Amathera it's a bit confusing as he has her enslaved and tortured and mind-raped, then continues to describe them as pouting like a little girl. This really bothers me, as it just felt completely unecessary; why portray a very minor character in such a way, what's the point? Furthermore, her enslavement and PTSD is not even dealt with in a serious manner at all.... she is just portrayed as a bad leader and annoying person, then a pouting freed slave who pouts a lot. Just... why?

5. I'm not going to go into it here, but I feel I must also point out that quite a few women get spanked in this series, which is arguably another kind of infantilization. When you combine that with all the pouting and sulking... it's definitely something to think about.

1628866973.0,Tom Bombadil - Who is he really?,"It’s a pretty astounding fact that Professor Tolkien created (approximately) 54,960 years of history between the creation of Arda and the destruction of the One Ring, and yet his fictional chronology is about as clear and compelling as our own 5000 years of real world history. It’s astounding that Tolkien created dozens of races to live in hundreds of locations over thousands of years, and yet it all fits together (for the most part) into one credible, consistent, and compatible Legendarium. It feels like Tolkien created a million pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and over the course of his lifetime, he put these pieces together and constructed one vast picture. However, not *every* piece of this puzzle fits. Peppered throughout the Legendarium there are a small number of enigmas, which add their own unique, yet utterly mysterious flavour, to Tolkien’s world. So let's delve into the most enigmatic enigma of them all – Tom Bombadil.

Now the first thing to say about Tom, is that he's a being of many names. But amongst them all, there is one constant.

The dude is old. Very old. To the Rohirric speaking Men, Tom is called Orald, which is an Old English word meaning ‘ancient’. To the Dwarves Tom is known as Forn, which is an Old Norse name that also pertains to ‘ancient days’. And to the Sindarin speaking Elves and the Dúnedain, he is known as Iarwain Ben-adar, which literally means ‘old young and fatherless.’

Now these revealing names immediately imply that Tom Bombadil may be one of the Ainur, as they are the oldest living things in the Legendarium, and technically, as offspring of Ilúvatar’s *thought*, they could all be considered fatherless. But I worry that this classification may be too simplistic for such an enigma. And being an Ainu does not even explain Tom’s most enigmatic traits.

So I guess the absolute simplest theory of Bombadil’s origin is that he’s a Maia. This explains his age and his power, and it doesn’t raise too many follow up questions, as Tolkien never gave us an exhaustive list of all the Maiar in his Legendarium. But being a Maia doesn’t explain everything.

Perhaps the most mysterious aspect of Tom is that the One Ring appears to have no effect on him. He takes it from Frodo, puts it on his finger, and yet nothing happens. He’s not corrupted, and he doesn’t turn invisible. And to be honest, there’s no way that this immunity to corruption is a Maia power. Because of course, loads of Maiar have been corrupted over the Ages, including Sauron himself, and we know that Gandalf (who is kind of a Maia) greatly fears the Ring’s corruption. Also if Tom is a Maia, then he wouldn’t be the oldest being in Middle-earth. Various members of the Valar including Manwë, Ulmo, Aulë, and of course Melkor, all existed in Arda before the Maiar were “\[drawn\] *unto them*”.

Now this has led to some theories that Tom (and by extension Goldberry) may be two of the Valar living in Middle-earth in disguise, but I don’t believe this is possible. There are only six married couples amongst the Valar, and none of them seem to have anything in common with Tom and Goldberry. Once upon a time I believed that Tom might be Oromë, and Goldberry might be his wife Vana. But this makes no sense. Oromë is a hunter of evil things, so why then would there be Barrow-wights living right on his doorstep? It’s also been suggested that Tom and Goldberry might be Aulë and Yavanna, but again this theory falls flat. If there’s one thing that can be confidently said about Goldberry, it’s that she is in some way connected with water, rivers and rain. She is after all the daughter of the River-woman, but the only Vala with any watery association is Ulmo, and he’s an unmarried male.

Now I’ve also seen it speculated that instead of being an Ainu, perhaps Tom Bombadil could potentially be Eru Ilúvatar himself in corporeal form. But honestly I don’t think this is likely either. I feel it somewhat cheapens Eru. And Tolkien himself agreed. When asked about the relationship between Bombadil and God, Tolkien replied, “*I really do think you are being too serious, besides missing the point.”*

So having expanded the list of things that Tom Bombadil is *not*, I suppose we should also take a look at what Tolkien actually *does* tell us about the character. We’re told that Tom is the “*Master of wood, water, and hill”,* and his interactions with Old Man Willow and the Barrow-wights suggests that he has some significant degree of power within his own realm. However the nature of this power is never stated. And if Tom truly has lived in the woods of Middle-earth since the very beginning, then he would have observed a remarkable diminishing of his realm over the years. At his own Council in Rivendell, Elrond explains that there was once a time *“when a squirrel could carry a nut from tree to tree from Rivendell to the Great Sea,""* which seems to state that western Middle-earth was once one huge forest. But as we know, by the Third Age this is no longer the case, and so if Tom Bombadil really is the *“Master of wood”,*then by the time of The Lord of the Rings, most of his realm has vanished. Does this mean his power is diminished too? And before we can even begin to answer that question, we first need to examine how much power does Tom actually have?

Because, when I first read *Fellowship of the Ring* I imagined that Tom Bombadil must be some sort of all-powerful being if he’s able to resist the power of the Ring. I assumed for this reason that he was more powerful than even Sauron. But I no longer think this is true. Although it’s very compelling to imagine Tom as having god-like powers and being the most powerful character in the story, I don’t believe this is what Tolkien intended. When Tom put the Ring on his finger, I don’t think he was outmatching Sauron’s power, I think he simply lacked the traits of ambition and possessive desire that the Ring targets in its victims. Again in the *Council of Elrond,* Gandalf argues against an elf called Erestor who suggested that Tom Bombadil *“has a power over the Ring”,* but instead Gandalf stated *“I should not put it so…Say rather that the Ring has no power over him. He is his own master. But he cannot alter the Ring itself, nor break its power over others.”* And later Gandalf goes on to say, *“could that power*\[Sauron\] *be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not. I think that in the end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall…*\[The\] p*ower to defy our Enemy is not in him.”* And furthermore, in Letter 144 Tolkien himself wrote, *“ultimately only the victory of the West will allow Bombadil to continue, or even to survive. Nothing would be left for him in the world of Sauron.”* So all of this suggests that although Tom does have significant power in his little corner of the world, he is not the all-powerful being that we sometimes imagine him to be.

So the question remains, why does Tom Bombadil even exist? I suppose an out of universe answer might simply be that Tolkien liked the name. His son Michael supposedly had a Dutch doll that was called Tom Bombadil, and so perhaps Tolkien simply included Tom as nothing more than a cameo for his son. However from an in-universe perspective, I think that the answer is a little more complex. Tom seems to represent a personification of peace and pacifism, and so perhaps he was created for this very purpose by Eru Ilúvatar way back in the beginning. Peace and natural woodland are things that Tolkien himself valued very highly, and so perhaps he wrote Tom to embody these virtues. However, it’s interesting to note that although both Gandalf and Elrond agree that Tom is a benevolent being, they both know that his pacifism alone will not be enough to prevent the spread of evil. Although the world needs pacifists like Tom, it also needs people like Frodo, and Aragorn, and Sam who are willing to go the distance see things through to their end. In 20th Century Europe, a century marked by generations of war, this may have been a topical theme for someone like Tolkien. He detested violence, and yet he was no pacifist.

So in conclusion, I feel like it might be a little disappointing for me to end this post with the statement, I don’t know, but I’m afraid that is the bottom line. In letter 174, Tolkien himself wrote *“as a story, I think it is good that there should be a lot of things unexplained…And even in a mythical Age there must be some enigmas, as there always are.”* So at the end of the day, I feel that Tolkien added these enigmas to his Legendarium on purpose, because not every facet of Middle-earth should be explained. There will always be mysteries, and we need to make peace with that. I believe it’s what Tolkien intended.

Anyway guys, thanks very much for reading this long post; as some of you may know, I've been working on a series of YouTube videos all about Professor Tolkien's Legendarium. The series is called *Tolkien Untangled*, and there are plenty of video essays like this one as well as videos explaining the Silmarillion, and the differences between the Lord of the Rings books and movies. I've just started a brand new weekly series all about the Elves of the First Age. So check out *Tolkien Untangled* on YouTube if you'd like to learn more.

1644942294.0,Sabriel by Garth Nix: an enchanting tale about death and new beginnings,"Talking cat, magic bells, abandoned castles, a journey into an old kingdom, the eerie feeling of impending darkness. All woven by beautiful charming language which gives the whole novel the feeling of a fairy tale, or of a waking dream being imagined just before the all-consuming sleep.

Sabriel is the best fantasy novel I read in more than a year. This was my first book by Garth Nix and I was not expecting to like his writing so much. Maybe it's because I've been living under a rock, but by coincidence, I had not seen any posts or commentaries about it here before I start reading it. Either way, I'm glad that I started because I was hooked by the writing style from the beginning.  


>You may call me Mogget. As to what I am, I was once many things, but now I am only several.

The book tells the story of Sabriel and her journey into the Old Kingdom, a place filled with magic and wonders and ruins where dormant evils await in shallow graves. In her mind, she carries the words of the ever-changing book of the dead, and on her body, a sword and seven bells of seven sizes, each if rang true will carry its sound even beyond life. Along this journey, the reader will experience moments of wonder, moments of apprehension, and moments of fear. All to answer if Sabriel is capable of growing to the needs of her dire quest.  


>Going through the arch, from mud into snow, from bright sun into the pallid luminescence of a snowfall, from her past into her future.

1704556088.0,Jaime Lannister vs. Hermione Granger: When George R.R. Martin decided to set the record straight.,"Back in the Spring of 2010 a website (suvudu) ran a ""March Madness"" style bracket of popular fantasy characters to determine which was the most powerful, as voted on by readers. Somehow Martin's **Jaime Lannister** ended up facing off against Rowling's **Hermione Granger** early on in the voting. For flavor's sake, one of the site's editors wrote what they thought would happen if such a fight occurred, and decided that in such a scenario Granger, with her magic, would easily defeat Lannister. They wrote that despite the power of his Valyrian steel sword, Granger could simply make him levitate upside down, and distract him with birds, and thus easily defeat the Kingslayer.

GRRM disagreed. The following was his response (some ASOIAF spoilers).

&#x200B;

>No, no.  
>  
>Jaime does not actually own a Valyrian steel sword. The blade he used to kill King Aerys is common castle-forged steel, gilded to match his golden armor. But he can certainly get hold of a Valyrian blade for the fight — Widow’s Wail, the twin to Oathkeeper, both made when his father had Ice melted down and reforged. Widow’s Wail went to Joffrey, but we all know how that turned out. Now it belongs to Tommen, but the kid’s not old enough to use it.  
>  
>A sword is not enough, though. This duel is life and death. Jaime is not likely to prance into that clearing smiling and clad only in cloth. He’ll armor himself before the match. His gilded plate-and-mail (this is not a fit occasion for the white of the Kingsguard), a crimson cloak, and a shield strapped to his right arm and emblazoned with the lion of Lannister. And of course he will have a helm. Knights who enter battle without one are soon dead. He can smile at Hermione before the match, then lower his visor. The helm, of course, would be fashioned in the shape of a maned lion. (Oddly enough, the Lannister arms look a lot like those of Gryffindor, which might give Hermione a moment’s pause).  
>  
>He’s not going to waste time and effort swatting at birds with his sword, either. He’s encased in gilded steel. What are they going to do, crap on him? He’ll rush right through the birds, and go straight for Hermione. A sword is not a knight’s only weapon. While she’s watching the blade, he will slam his shield right into her face, knock her off her feet. Let her try and mumble those spells with a mouthful of broken teeth.  
>  
>And if somehow Granger does get off that spell (cheating, really) and turn him upside down, Jaime is more likely to undo the straps on his shield and fling it at her head then to hang there meekly waiting to die.  
>  
>But hey, let’s say everything goes the way your “experts” say it will, and Hermione wins. Sad to say, she will not live long to enjoy her victory. Sometime very soon, when she least expects it, a “boy” she does not know will bump up against her in the corridors of Hogwarts… and suddenly she’ll find a dagger sliding through her ribs, right into her heart. “A Lannister always pays his debts,” Tyrion will say, as he slips back into the shadows.

> ""I did begin a story placed about 100 years after the Downfall, but it proved both sinister and depressing. Since we are dealing with Men, it is inevitable that we should be concerned with the most regrettable feature of their nature: their quick satiety with good. So that the people of Gondor in times of peace, justice and prosperity, would become discontented and restless — while the dynasts descended from Aragorn would become just kings and governors — like Denethor or worse.

1589294861.0,"Dear author-hopefuls of r/Fantasy, there is something you really need to know: Writing is not a talent. It is a skill.","Most of this little monologue is copied and pasted from my response to a post by [u/ProbablyInterned](https://www.reddit.com/u/ProbablyInterned/), who was lamenting their lack of ability compared to the likes of Joe Abercombie. I've seen a good number of such comments and fears discussed in my time here on r/Fantasy, and I wanted to address them with a simple fact I think a lot of author-hopefuls and struggling writers really, *really* need to understand:

**Writing is not a talent. It is a** ***skill.***

What I mean by that is that is--while having a talent for writing is certainly helpful--it is not something you are born being as good at as you will ever be. It is *completely natural* to compare your style and prose and narrative to your favorite authors, but you need to remember that the likes of GRRM, Robert Jordan, Joe Abercrombie, Michael J. Sullivan, Brent Weeks, Robin Hobb, etc.... they have all written a lot--I mean a LOT--of books, and have undoubtedly surpassed the 10,000 hour master mark and then some. Their writings have developed and adapted, improved and tempered themselves over time.

Just like yours can and will.

Don't get me wrong. Your first attempt(s) is/are likely to be complete trash. Thing is: that's 100% ok. Personally my first book was so garbage the only single person who ever finished it was my father. I ended up setting it aside for more than 10 years, wrote a completely different story, and then came back to it. With rewriting, that book became the single biggest seller I have to date.

It's totally fine to feel like you're nothing compared to the likes of Joe Abercrombie and his ilk. Chances are you *are* nothing, but you are only nothing ***right now***. With patience, passion, and a lot of practice, you could very well outstrip a few, a lot, or maybe even every author out there one day. You don't know, and you never will unless you try.

Write. Just do it. Accept that it may/will probably be complete trash. If it's not, awesome. If it is, that's awesome too, because you have dozens and dozens of hours of practice now.

Do not let the fear of failing something prevent you from attempting it. You are not a failed writer if you fail at writing a good story. You are a failed writer only when you stop trying to make the next project that much better.

Good luck, kick ass, and welcome to the immensely fun world of fantasy and writing :)

1711021311.0,"Le Guin talks about the ""twist"" of LOTR's characters and themes","From the book Language of the Night:

>  Critics have been hard on Tolkien for his ""simplisticness,"" his division of the inhabitants of Middle Earth into the good people and the evil people. And indeed he does this, and his good people tend to be entirely good, though with endearing frailties, while his Orcs and other villains are altogether nasty. But all this is a judgment by daylight ethics, by conventional standards of virtue and vice. When you look at the story as a psychic journey, you see something quite different, and very strange. You see then a group of bright figures, each one with its black shadow. Against the Elves, the Orcs. Against Aragorn, the Black Rider. Against Gandalf, Saruman. And above all, against Frodo, Gollum. Against him--and with him.  
>  
>  It is truly complex, because both the figures are clearly doubled. Sam is, in part, Frodo's shadow, his ""inferior"" part. Gollum is two people, too, in a more direct, schizophrenic sense; he's always talking to himself, Slinker talking to Stinker, Sam calls it. Sam understands Gollum very well, though he won't admit it and won't accept Gollum as Frodo does, letting Gollum be their guide, trusting him. Frodo and Gollum are not only both hobbits; they are the same person--and Frodo knows it. Frodo and Sam are the bright side, Smeagol-Gollum the shadow side. In the end Sam and Smeagol, the lesser figures, drop away, and all that is left is Frodo and Gollum, at the end of the long quest. And it is Frodo the good who fails, who at the last moment claims the Ring of Power for himself; and it is Gollum the evil who achieves the quest, destroying the Ring, and himself with it. The Ring, the archetype of the Integrative Function, the creative-destructive, returns to the volcano, the eternal source of creation and destruction, the primal fire. When you look at it that way, can you call it a simple story? I suppose so. Oedipus Rex is a fairly simple story, too. But it is not simplistic. It is the kind of story that can be told only by one who has turned and faced his shadow and looked into the dark.

1596625005.0,"A challenge, a plea: Don't recommend Malazan or Sanderson, I dare you!","Before your hackles rise into orbit, hear me out!

Readers of r/fantasy will be well aware of the existence of Malazan and Sanderson's flotilla of books, and also aware of their popularity, and tendency to pop up in recommendation threads like mushrooms after rain. We joke about it, but also people counter with the argument that Malazan *does* have pirates, or Stormlight *does* have romance, etc etc. 

And you know what? This is true. Moreover Erickson and Sanderson are not bad, perhaps they are even great writers in the fantasy genre. But you know what else is great? Pizza.

Imagine, if you will, someone asks for a food recommendation, they want something with mushrooms. 

""How about a mushroom pizza?"" you say. ""After all, pizza is great, I could eat it all the time, and pizza has mushrooms on it.""

Then, someone asks for a recipes with smoked meat. ""Have you considered a pepperoni pizza?"" you ask. ""Or a ham pizza? If you're feeling cheeky, you can get some pineapple on it! Pizza is great, it's my favourite meal in the world."" The beauty of pizza, is that whatever someone wants, it's probably wound up on a pizza at some point. Plus, you get all that sauce and cheese. 

Sanderson and Malazan are the pizza of r/fantasy. Everybody knows about them. Almost everyone has tried them. They have all kinds of ingredients in them. But you probably don't need to recommend pizza; everyone knows about it and will eat it if they feel like it. And whilst you can put just about anything on-a-pizza/in-an-Erickson/Sanderson book, at the end of the day, it's still *primarily* going to be a pizza/Erickson/Sanderson book.

But what about a chicken tagine? Or some dukbokki? Or [that weird cheese with worms in it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casu_marzu)? Why don't we recommend those? Most people haven't tried them, may not even know about them. Also, if someone is after some cheese with worms in it (And who isn't in this crazy mixed up world?), why would you recommend a blue cheese pizza that a moth landed on? 

I feel like when we consistently recommend the same books, especially when they may only tangentially be related to the request, we crowd out other recommendations. This is compounded when these recommendations get tonnes of upvotes from people that love the books (and that's fine! Ain't nothing wrong with loving Deadhouse Gates, or The Alloy of Law or whatever! This is not a criticism of your favourite author/s!).

And if, you know, Malazan or Sanderson books are the only recommendation you can think of, when someone asks for a romance novel, or mythic feel etc, **maybe instead of *making* recommendations you should *take* some, and broaden your fantasy horizons a little**. 

There is a staggering array of food out there that makes the restaurant at the start of *Spirited Away* look like a McDonalds. Why would we keep heading back to pizza, when there is so much more to sample? Let's challenge ourselves and others to mix it up a bit, rather than sending them back to Dominos.

1617315195.0,J.R.R. Tolkien novel sales pass 600 million,"HarperCollins [has released updated sales figures](https://twitter.com/theoneringnet/status/1377738038755930112) for J.R.R. Tolkien's books, acquired by Tolkien fansite TheOneRing. These sales figures have been unified in English for the first time because News Corp., which already owns HarperCollins (Tolkien's British publishers), has also acquired Houghton Mifflin, Tolkien's American publishers.

The figures indicate that sales of Tolkien's books have surpassed 600 million. Counting Tolkien's book sales have been notoriously difficult due to poor accounting, legions of unauthorised overseas editions and even pirate editions of the book being sold in the United States (most famously the Ace Books edition of 1965, which sparked an international outcry and helped catapult Tolkien to greater fame and success in the States), so even this is a conservative figure.

Sales of 600 million would put Tolkien comfortably in the top ten selling authors of fiction of all time, although (contrary to some reports) nowhere near the top. William Shakespeare's plays have sold over 4 billion copies, whilst Agatha Christie's novels have sold at least 2 billion and possibly closer to 4 billion copies. From there it's a steeper drop to Barbara Cartland, who has sold around 750 million copies of her romance novels, just ahead of Danielle Steel on an estimated 700 million. Harold Robbins and Georges Simenon are around 700 million apiece as well.

Tolkien's sales put him at approximate parity with Enid Blyton, Sidney Sheldon and J.K. Rowling, who are all between 500 and 700 million in sales, and comfortably ahead of the likes of Dr. Seuss, Leo Tolstoy, Jackie Collins, Dean Koontz and Stephen King. Tolkien's friend C.S. Lewis can ""only"" muster 200 million sales of his books (mostly the **Narnia** series).

However, although Tolkien may not be the biggest-selling novelist of all time, he *may* have the biggest-selling individual novel. The overwhelming majority of Tolkien's book sales come from *The Lord of the Rings*, which across all editions and both the three and one-volume versions of the text has sold almost half a billion copies. *The Hobbit* has sold over 100 million copies. The combined sales of all of Tolkien's other books, although still respectable, fall well short of those figures.

Among contemporary and recent fantasy authors, George R.R. Martin, Sir Terry Pratchett and Robert Jordan have achieved just short of 100 million sales apiece, whilst Brandon Sanderson has sold around 30 million copies of his novels and Patrick Rothfuss roughly half that.

**ETA:** The One Ring has clarified their report as an ""April Fool's"" gag, a bit of a non-sequitur one since the figures are actually fully credible (if anything, on the conservative) side of things: Tolkien had sold over 400 million books by 2001, so an additional 200 million sales in twenty years, a period when Tolkien's popularity exploded beyond all recognition due to the success of the films (and HarperCollins were attributing a 50 million boost in sales as early as 2003), is pretty easy to believe.",Fantasy
1657935769.0,"So, I just finished reading The Way Of Kings By Brandon Sanderson. WOW.","The only other Book I read by Sanderson was The Final Empire and I thoroughly enjoyed it. So coming into The Way of Kings I thought I had a good indication on what to expect. I was wrong.  The first thing that stood out to me was the world building in this book. It was so well realized compared to The Final Empire. Just how much detail went into this world was astounding.     The magic was very interesting. I really thought that Sanderson did a great job creating Characters with different voices. Kaladin, Dalinar, Adolin, Shallan, Wit, and Jasnah just to name a few. They all had their own unique voice.  I would be lying if I didn’t say that Kaladin wasn’t my favorite I have a soft spot for unexpectedly strong leaders. Sanderson also made me enjoy the flashback chapters. I’ve never been a big fan of flash back chapters. But the ones in this book really felt like they were important and not just written for the sake of word count. Even though it was a 1,000 page book it didn’t feel like that at all. I was worried a little because Stormlight is a pillar in the community and is beloved by so many people and I was thinking that what if it doesn’t click for me. That wasn’t the case I’m a huge fan . The interludes was another part that I looked forward to. Even though we didn’t spend that much time with Szeth I felt like he was a in the book more than he actually was. His arc was one of my favorite parts. 

I’m a bit sad that I didn’t get Sanderson’s kickstarter, I didn’t want to invest $200+ for a author I wasn’t fully sure I would like his writing. Hindsight is 20/20.

Back in 1984 my mother filed for custody of my brother and I, and lost. Rather than give us back she took us and ran. We lived under assumed names for about a year, but eventually were caught.

My constant companion during that crazy year, and the worse that followed, was fantasy. The Chronicles of Prydain. The Hobbit. Narnia. Eventually Dragonlance, and Lord of the Rings. Dark Sun and Shadowrun and Forgotten Realms. The Deathgate Cycle. Tad Williams.

I always had my nose buried in a book. I always read something. No matter how chaotic the world got, or how little control I had over my life there was always fantasy. Some world I could lose myself in, with its own rules. A world where the protagonist could grow, and seize control of their own destiny the way I wanted to.

I don't know what would have happened to me if I hadn't had reading during that turbulent time. It certainly set the tone for my life since. I became a writer, and a game master, and eventually a full time author.

I owe all of that to fantasy. To the imagination of all the wonderful minds that came before. So thank you Margaret Weis, and Tracy Hickman. Thank you Robin Hobb, and C.S. Lewis. Thank you Tolkien. 

Millions and millions of us found our way through the darkness, and into the light, because you showed us the way.

If you're one of the kids just starting this journey, and still lost in those turbulent times, then draw strength from Sturm, and Drizzt, and Gandalf, and whoever else gives you the strength to keep aspiring to be the best version of you.

1596684063.0,"I just read Mistborn, and man was it fantastic","I've never really been into Fantasy besides basic stuff like Harry Potter or Percy Jackson. My Lord of the Rings obsessed friends forced me to watch all the movies, and I got halfway through Dune before I stopped reading it - I just didn't really enjoy either. But I've wanted to get out of my reading comfort zone this year and try some fantasy, and upon hearing good things about it, I bought the Mistborn trilogy.

Holy crap, guys. You all weren't kidding about Brando Sando. The trilogy was amazing. And I finally found a high fantasy that I actually like!

I thought the first book was just okay - not bad, but nowhere near as good as people were claiming - but a pretty straightforward 'plucky rebels fight the dark lord' story you've seen a million times. I'm not really into magic (hence why I have a hard time getting into fantasy) but Brandon made allomancy so interesting that I found myself getting into it. The first action/heist scene with Kelsier really showed how creative and interesting this allomancy idea could be when used well, and that creativity continued through the trilogy. And even while I thought the story was basic, the characters were excellent. All flawed and realistic yet easy to root for. Vin and Kelsier were excellent co-protagonists, and I particularly liked how well they complemented each other: not only in personalities and outlook, but they would even call out each other's flaws and help each other to grow because of it. Sazed was also cool, and I really came to love Elend, especially as he became a main character in the latter books.

Books 2 and 3 brought all of the great parts of the first, like characterization, into a more unique story that ditched the typical dark lord plot for a far more original one. Brando Sando likes his slow burns but the payoff is fantastic. Elend had probably one of the most badass character arcs in existence in the second book, and the relationship between Vin and Oreseur was another great highlight. And that cliffhanger ending - man. I can't remember the last time a book gave me genuine chills.

I just finished the third book today, and don't really want to say much more in case anyone hasn't read the series yet, but what a well-plotted, well-crafted trilogy. The ending was a bit strange, but ultimately satisfying and actually left me a little teary-eyed. The villain felt threatening but also personable, and despite everything didn't really feel evil - just like a force, trying to do his thing. I like how Spook actually had something to do in this one. And honestly, Elend might have become one of my favorite fictional characters ever.

I just wanted to come here and unleash my appreciation for the series. I was a little hesitant at first since I was never much of a fantasy guy, but this was the perfect intro into the world of  adult fantasy. I'll definitely be reading more Brandon Sanderson, and I think I've opened my mind to more books in the genre in general. I just saw a post challenging people not to recommend Sanderson, but Imma refute that by saying I think he just made me a fantasy nerd, and I only heard of him because of the people on this subreddit. That is all. Just had to gush about this trilogy for a minute.",Fantasy
1681487774.0,What to do when you've read all of the good books?,"**Edit2: Oh Reddit, I love you. I'm turning off notifications for the night, but make sure to sort by controversial! :)**

&#x200B;

I've read Sanderson, Abercrombie, Butcher, Erikson, Martin, Hobb, and Jordan. I've either read what's at the bookstore, or have dismissed it as trash because I know it's not for me. Why aren't there any good books left? What am I supposed to do? Do I just re-read now? I should just re-read now, right?

**Edit: I know a lot of you stopped reading here, but maybe keep on going ;)**

Okay the title and that opening paragraph is clickbait, except it isn't. I've been on Reddit for over a decade now (fuck I'm old), and I see this regularly. Either blatantly (posts with the exact same title as I've used) or more just as a frustrated ""I have no idea how to find anymore books from what I've been reading."" Most book places tend to get a little stuck with what they love, and there tends to be a feeling that there's nothing else ""good"" out there beyond the little circle.

I've decided to come to the rescue. This is a massive roundup of places to find your next favourite read.

**Read some Canadians**

None of you are reading enough Canadians. Tanya Huff. Charles R. Saunders. Spider Robinson.  Élisabeth Vonarburg. Charles de Lint.  Nalo Hopkinson. Eileen Kernaghan.  Silvia Moreno-Garcia. Robert J. Sawyer. Nancy Kilpatrick.  Julie E. Czerneda. Peter Watts. This list continues.

Your first stop would be the check out the [Prix Aurora Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Award_for_Best_Novel) to get started. Then, check out the [Sunburst Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunburst_Award), which often has very different winners from the Aurora Awards. Then, check out my essay about Canadian SFF [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/67wnmh/reflections\_on\_community\_and\_gender\_in\_canadian/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/67wnmh/reflections_on_community_and_gender_in_canadian/) \-- reddit isn't letting me link it in).

**Check out the Aurealis Award**

With some categories going back to the 90s, the [Aurealis Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurealis_Award) offers up an amazing selection of fiction that is often difficult to find on big box shelves here in Canada (since, let's face it, this is a Canadian-centric post). I also recommend you check out the anthology category - there's some fabulous work in there, including Kisses by Clockwork and Bloodlines (...or was it Bloodstones I read? They're both edited by the same person...you know what? Get both just to be sure).

**Read Jo Walton's Short History of the Hugos**

Now, this seems like a weird one, but trust me. You don't need to have liked a single book ever shortlisted by the Hugos to find immense value in this book for the sheer book recommendations Walton offers. I'm talking year over year lists of what she read from the 50s to 2000. She also brings into the book the World Fantasy Awards, too, which offers a completely different list of books a lot of times.

**Check out Janny Wurts' post history**

Trust me. This woman knows more obscure, underrated books than I do, and that's quite an admission on my part. I did a [short roundup of her recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/c306z8/janny_recommends_some_of_the_books_janny_wurts/) a few years ago to get you started.

**Sign up for the ebookaroo newsletter**

It's difficult to get a wide net of indie book recommendations on r/Fantasy (we tend to recommend just a handful of authors that rotates out every year), so I think [ebookaroo is a great way to find new-to-you authors](https://pattyjansen.com/ebookaroo/). It's ran by SFF author Patty Jansen who's Australian, for those who need that extra info ;) ), and I think it's weekly (might be every 10 days, I forget), and contains a mixture of box sets, new releases, free books, giveaways, sale books, and all of that. It's quite a mixture, too. I often find new SF in particular to read through it.

**Check out our top lists...starting oldest first**

[Scroll right on down to 2014](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/wiki/lists/) and start there. r/Fantasy's tastes have changed a lot over the years (except for the Top novels. That tends to be the same with some recent bias). All of the other ones, however, I've found change a far amount over the years and so I really do think giving it a go from the bottom up would work for so many people here.

1685857747.0,"Friend and I are looking for non-military ""competence porn"" - people who are just EXCELLENT at their jobs","**UPDATE: I HAVE AGGREGATED THE LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS THREAD INTO A SPREADSHEET**   
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12gohixpu8k4x4UYFkOqCehDou05Kmc8HFcosrR7PRGY/edit?usp=sharing   

It has links to goodreads. If a series was recommended, I only added the first book. 

------

Hey guys, I just finished Project Hail Mary and was telling my friend about the story. He correctly identified my description, along with The Martian, as fitting into the genre of, as he terms it, ""competence porn"".  

- character excels at their job because they have worked hard to attain the skills, not because they are The Chosen One who is Supernaturally Special.     
- the thing they're good at is not violence, martial arts, killing, or military strategy. the more mundane the better, although thieves or  politicians might fit in this category.
- you get to see them do the thing they're good at, so you are kinda ""learning how it works""
- frequently doesn't have an actual antagonist; the setting just presents a situation where the protagonist's skills are needed
- they are applying their skills in either unexpected ways (thinking outside the box) or at a virtuoso level of skill

FWIW when you're recommending stuff, we both like hopepunk/cozy stuff more than grim stuff, but that's not necessary to the original idea. 

I also think heist stories *can* fit here, but some of them don't, because often the characters just get lucky and everything goes their way, or because they're ""the chosen one"" of cleverness. I think Locke Lamora doesn't work, for example, because he's just supernaturally good at lying and disguise, even above and beyond all the practice he and his crew get.

He gave a couple other examples:  

* The Dragon's Banker by Scott Warren    
* Machine, by Elizabeth Bear   
* Monk and Robot by Becky Chambers   
* Cithrin in The Dagger and Coin by Daniel Abraham  
* Tara in Three Parts Dead by Max Gladstone  
* Apollo 13 (movie)   
* Fred the Vampire Accountant brushes on this, because his accounting skills frequently save the day, although you don't spend much of the books ""seeing"" the accounting happen  
 
some stories that have a bit of military stuff in them but lean closer to what we're looking for: 

* Sixteen Ways to Defend a Walled City - KJ Parker  
* in The Expanse - Anna Volovodov (the minister), Avasarala is on the edge of it because she's a politician  
* Gen from The Thief/Attolia series by Megan Whalen Turner  

Baru Cormorant might fit, but we both hated it so much we didn't finish the first book, so I can't tell you for sure.   

Murderbot is technically a great example of the IDEA of competence porn, but we're specifically asking for some recs that DO NOT include violence. Plus murderbot was programmed that way ;)

edited to add:
holy moly, I've NEVER gotten a response like this on a post before. This is amazing! Thanks for all your suggestions. Many of them I have read but didn't include either to keep the post ~~short~~ less endless, or because I forgot, or because we were trying to be specific enough in the request to prevent every fantasy book ever from qualifying, lol!

I think for me, the ultimate thing that helps a book fit in this category we've made up is whether I get to watch the person do their skill, step by step. Extra cool if I learn about the skill, too.

Finally, someone pointed out a non fantasy book, which reminded me that the realistic fiction kids' books My Side of the Mountain and Island of the Blue Dolphins fit this category as well. They were some of my favorites as a kid.",Fantasy

1666396444.0,Things from Tolkien No One Copies,"Everyone thinks of Tolkien as the father of Epic Fantasy.  His influence was huge...but sometimes exaggerated.  There are things everyone thinks came from Tolkien that did not.  There are things that Tolkien did that have seldom been imitated.  

What things elements from Tolkien are rarely imitated?  

I'll start.  The MC.  Few books that aren't parodies have hobbits, and few have one hundred year old gentry as MCs.  (Street rats, thieves, and young nobles are more common.)",Fantasy
1636941038.0,DUNE - Do yourself a favor and try the book,"I just have to voice this here if anyone is on the fence like I was. Was thinking about reading Dune for years, but a lot of common criticisms get levied at it: boring, sterile, confusing, pretentious, and slow.

After watching the film I really wanted to spend more time in this universe, so I grabbed my Kindle and found myself blasting through the first 100 pages and had to force myself to go to bed. Now I keep thinking about it. I'm now at page 300 and I'm loving it more and more. Can't wait to get past where the movie ended.

Let yourself decide if you like it. The plot, political complexities, subtle yet expert character work, immersive world building, and touches of dark fantasy/scifi is so satisfying. There is some older forms of English wording present in the text I struggle with, but nothing a dictionary can't help. It's not slow at all; the pacing is really satisfying and tense. The dialogue is nuanced and clever, with a smooth shifting of POV within scenes. You get a really clear idea of what's going on in the minds of each character in a given conversation. The plot is relatable in the sense that you can think about what's going on and meditate on the complexities of our own world/context. My favorite thing about the book is how the chapters flow. It provides a sort of instant gratification in how the scenes and plot progress, which makes me want to keep reading.

If you enjoyed the film, I think you should try the book. My main gripe with the film is I didn't think the character work had enough room to breathe. The book satisfies my gripe. My fantasy background is primarily Tolkien, Abercrombie, and Sanderson. If you like the First Law I think you'll feel at home here if you enjoy the sinister political atmosphere. Feel free to recommend anything else that you think I or others might enjoy.",Fantasy
1615043152.0,Fantasy has taken the magic out of magic.,"I've loved magic, horror, and the supernatural for a long time (big fan of Tolkein, Lovecraft, etc) and so I've been struggling lately to try and figure out why so much current fantasy (Sanderson, Hobb, for example) bores the hell out of me. Its been very frustrating, especially when fantasy seems on the cusp of a renaissance, to find yourself bored out of your mind. It wasn't until I started reading magical realism that I figured it out, that as the title says, a lot of modern fantasy has taken the magic out of magic.

I'll explain using Mistborn. In Mistborn, magic is has very rigid rules. Everyone knows it exists. Government programs use it for suppression. It's even powered by minerals that need to be mined. An extremely industrialized magic. It is, for all intents and purposes, just an alternative science. And so Mistborn is really just a matter of watching people use the science of their world to solve problems in a straightforward, very materialist and pragmatic way. Reading the book, I felt bored.

Just this week, I turned to magical realism and started reading A Murmur of Bees. It's set in our world, during the Spanish Flu epidemic. When it become clear that little Simonopio >!can speak to the bees that kept him company while he was abandoned as an infant, and that he can see the future,!< I felt that familiar rush of wonder. It was exciting and it drew me in! the reason is: his magic takes place in a world where it is not part of the natural order; it is a strange, mysterious intrusion, inexplicable and also wonderful! It bears that mark of total otherness from the quotidian world, something truly supernatural.

I get it, of course, different strokes for different folks. Some people love magic that is just actually alternative science, that's a mundane, well known part of the fantasy world inhabited by the protagonists. And you are not wrong to like what you like.

But I think there is room for more fantasy that treats magic as something truly outside of the natural order: that still confronts us with what is not understood (and maybe can't be), that upsets our materialistic understanding of the universe rather than supporting it. 

Just thought I would submit this for discussion. Has anyone else felt this way? Does anyone have book suggestions where magic is still magic

Edit: Oh my God, thank you guys! This has been such an interesting conversation and I appreciate all the book suggestions so much. I'm a big reader, but it's been really hard to find books I can get her into lately, and this is great for me.

And thank you for the awards!",Fantasy

Absolutely Fantastic.","I'm obviously a bit late on this, but this is coming from someone who's heard great things about Discworld on reddit and elsewhere. This week I just finished my first book, *Guards, Guards!* and I'm already hooked. The references and humour were amazing and I even sent some friends pictures of the excerpts with no context (and they haven't read Discworld either).

I loved how dragons were portrayed in the book, and carrot might be one of my favourite non-serious characters of any book I've read

We, as readers, are allowed to point out inconsistencies and call out authors for their mistakes. Though we should always remember to be reasonable in our commentary and not hate on an author just because we can. That being said, fans have every right to defend their favorite authors and stories.

However, every time someone mentions that Tolkien is hard to read, or points out Martin’s hypocrisy and Pullman’s delusions when it comes to their comments on Tolkien (yes, I see my own hypocrisy), throwing a tantrum is just ridiculous.",Fantasy

1591465146.0,The Gentleman Bastards is absolutely amazing,"If you care only about my opinions skip down

First off, I have only listened to the first 2 book, now yes, listened not read, but I wanted to use my free Audible credits, and a book tuber named Daniel Greene greatly recommended the Gentlemen Bastards series. So the first book was 22 hours so I thought it was a good idea to get a long book for free rather then a short one, so I picked up ‘the lies of Locke Lamora’ and after I finished, oh my, this is one of the best books ever (that I have read)

SKIP HERE

Now, the first book, the Lies of Locke Lamora was amazing, I plan to listen to it again cuz it’s so great, but the reason why, it doesn’t just follow the ‘good guys’ the main characters, the gentlemen Bastards are dirty thieves, the book is kind of a heist but in a fantastical world, the main character don’t have any powers beyond being just really great at stealing. Now that may sound boring, but no, the book is also about saving the criminal underworld, it is an amazing combination that I have never seen anything like (not that I’m sure well read) but I immensely enjoyed it, and I hope you would too, please, if your interested ask any questions in the comments, also the first book has a finish that doesn’t demand you read the next book, so if you read it and think ‘meh’ then you don’t need to pick up the second 
Anyway I hope this was helpful, I have been told it’s one of the most underrated series, but I hope this will encourage more people to read it

They were like on death´s door but they got rescued in the . I really dislike this kind of writing. If the main antagonists do not suffer setbacks in some of the books, then it seems that the tension will be lost, or least for me. My critic seems to be premature since i have not finished the books yet. But everything Nathair does works out very well. I still like the books and will continue reading them. I find this trope annoying. 

This is not only about TFATF series but many series fall into making the antagonists infallible until the final book.

If the antagonists do not suffer setbacks or defeats, how would a villain learn, evolve, grow and reflect  on the mistakes that one made.

I understand that authors write this way to create more tension and desperation for the protags, but this annoys me especially when reading Courage and seeing every antagonist win or escape at the last moment.

These shows need ridiculously high viewer numbers in order to be profitable.  There is no book or series popular enough to get the ratings a show needs by simply bringing in the original fans alone.

These shows are made specifically for non/new fans. 

Studios know that they will likely be able to keep the majority of book fans no matter what, because we are loyal to the author/series, etc. But even if they lose most of us, so what?

As cynical as it sounds, they don’t really need us. They don’t have to be 100% loyal to the source material, just enough to make a show that new people will be into.

This also means that even if we the fans, in our echo chamber, think a show sucks - the studio may view it as a success.

Like it or not, Wheel of Time was a massive success, ratings wise. Witcher was too. 

Even Blood Origin seems to be doing well with viewers. 

Folks, we are not the target audience. 

We are the happy bonus. 

EDIT: To be clear, though, I blame studios on this more than (most) showrunners. I know many don’t agree, but I think most of these showrunners are still passionate about the source material (Rafe Judkins for example)",Fantasy

1596380337.0,Some excellent fantasy books by Black authors,"Though almost absent in the early years of fantasy writing, the number of Black authors—and the recognition of their work—is growing year by year.

It’s impossible to talk about fantasy written by Black authors as a cohesive genre because, like writers of other skin tones, Black authors come from all over the world and write about a wildly diverse array of subjects in their own unique ways and voices.

Despite that, I’m including this list because most other lists of fantasy books tend to be heavy on white folk, and trumpeting the achievements of Black authors should help balance that out a little bit.

Note: I’m using “Black” instead of “African-American” because a number of these authors are not American.

 

#23. *The Haunting of Tram Car 015* by P. Djèlí Clark – 2019

Finalist for the Hugo, Nebula, and Locus awards.

Cairo, 1912: The case started as a simple one for the Ministry of Alchemy, Enchantments and Supernatural Entities—handling a possessed tram car.

Soon, however, Agent Hamed Nasr and his new partner Agent Onsi Youssef are exposed to a new side of Cairo stirring with suffragettes, secret societies, and sentient automatons in a race against time to protect the city from an encroaching danger that crosses the line between the magical and the mundane.

#22. *Kingdom of Souls* by Rena Barron – 2019

*Book 1 of 2 in the Kingdom of Souls series*

Heir to two lines of powerful witchdoctors, Arrah yearns for magic of her own. Yet she fails at bone magic, fails to call upon her ancestors, and fails to live up to her family’s legacy. Under the disapproving eye of her mother, the Kingdom’s most powerful priestess and seer, Arrah fears she may never be good enough.

But when the Kingdom’s children begin to disappear, Arrah is desperate enough to turn to a forbidden, dangerous ritual. If she has no magic of her own, she’ll have to buy it—by trading away years of her own life.

Arrah’s borrowed power reveals a nightmarish betrayal, and on its heels, a rising tide of darkness that threatens to consume her and all those she loves. She must race to unravel a twisted and deadly scheme… before the fight costs more than she can afford.

Life in real-world Atlanta isn’t always so simple, as Alice juggles an overprotective mom, a high-maintenance best friend, and a slipping GPA. Keeping the Nightmares at bay is turning into a full-time job. But when Alice’s handsome and mysterious mentor is poisoned, she has to find the antidote by venturing deeper into Wonderland than she’s ever gone before. And she’ll need to use everything she’s learned in both worlds to keep from losing her head… literally.

#20. *Dread Nation* by Justina Ireland – 2018

*Book 1 of 2 in the Dread Nation series*

Jane McKeene was born two days before the dead began to walk the battlefields of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania—derailing the War Between the States and changing the nation forever.

In this new America, safety for all depends on the work of a few, and laws like the Native and Negro Education Act require certain children attend combat schools to learn to put down the dead.

But there are also opportunities, and Jane is studying to become an Attendant, trained in both weaponry and etiquette to protect the well-to-do. It’s a chance for a better life for Negro girls like Jane. After all, not even being the daughter of a wealthy white Southern woman could save her from society’s expectations.

But that’s not a life Jane wants. Almost finished with her education at Miss Preston’s School of Combat in Baltimore, Jane is set on returning to her Kentucky home and doesn’t pay much mind to the politics of the eastern cities, with their talk of returning America to the glory of its days before the dead rose.

But when families around Baltimore County begin to go missing, Jane is caught in the middle of a conspiracy, one that finds her in a desperate fight for her life against some powerful enemies.

And the restless dead, it would seem, are the least of her problems.

#19. *The Ballad of Black Tom* by Victor LaValle – 2016

This novella was a finalist for the Hugo, Nebula, Locus, World Fantasy, and Bram Stoker Awards.

People move to New York looking for magic, and nothing will convince them it isn’t there.

Charles Thomas Tester hustles to put food on the table and keep the roof over his father’s head. He knows what magic a suit can cast, the invisibility a guitar case can provide, and the curse written on his skin that attracts the eye of wealthy white folks and their cops. But when he delivers an occult tome to a reclusive sorceress in the heart of Queens, Tom opens a door to a deeper realm of magic, and earns the attention of things best left sleeping.

A storm that might swallow the world is building in Brooklyn. Will Black Tom live to see it break?

#18. *The Good Luck Girls* by Charlotte Nicole Davis – 2019

Aster, the protector

Violet, the favorite

Tansy, the medic

Mallow, the fighter

Clementine, the catalyst

The country of Arketta calls them Good Luck Girls―but they know their luck is anything but.

Sold to a “welcome house” as children and branded with cursed markings.

Trapped in a life they would never have chosen.

When Clementine accidentally kills a man, the girls risk a dangerous escape and harrowing journey to find freedom, justice, and revenge in a country that wants them to have none of those things. Pursued by Arketta’s most vicious and powerful forces, both human and inhuman, their only hope lies in a bedtime story passed from one Good Luck Girl to another, a story that only the youngest or most desperate would ever believe.

It’s going to take more than luck for them all to survive.

#17. *The Palm-Wine Drinkard* by Amos Tutuola – 1952

This classic novel tells the phantasmagorical story of an alcoholic man and his search for his dead palm-wine tapster. As he travels through the land of the dead, he encounters a host of supernatural and often terrifying beings—among them the complete gentleman who returns his body parts to their owners and the insatiable hungry-creature. Author Tutola mixes Yoruba folktales with what T. S. Eliot described as a “creepy crawly imagination.”

#16. *The Water Dancer* by Ta-Nehisi Coates – 2019

Young Hiram Walker was born into bondage. When his mother was sold away, Hiram was robbed of all memory of her—but was gifted with a mysterious power. Years later, when Hiram almost drowns in a river, that same power saves his life. This brush with death births an urgency in Hiram and a daring scheme: to escape from the only home he’s ever known.

So begins an unexpected journey that takes Hiram from the corrupt grandeur of Virginia’s proud plantations to desperate guerrilla cells in the wilderness, from the coffin of the Deep South to dangerously idealistic movements in the North. Even as he’s enlisted in the underground war between slavers and the enslaved, Hiram’s resolve to rescue the family he left behind endures.

#15. *Mumbo Jumbo* by Ishmael Reed – 1972

Hailed by Harold Bloom as one of the five hundred greatest books of the Western canon.

In 1920s America, a plague is spreading fast. From New Orleans to Chicago to New York, the “Jes Grew” epidemic makes people desperate to dance, overturning social norms in the process. Anyone is vulnerable and when they catch it, they’ll bump and grind into a frenzy. Working to combat the Jes Grew infection are the puritanical Atonists, a group bent on cultivating a “Talking Android,” an African American who will infiltrate the unruly black communities and help crush the outbreak. But PaPa LaBas, a voodoo priest, is determined to keep his ancient culture—including a key spiritual text—alive.

#14. *Skin Folk* by Nalo Hopkinson – 2001

Stories in this collection range from science fiction to Caribbean folklore, passionate love, and chilling horror. Author Nalo Hopkinson spins tales like “Precious,” in which the narrator spews valuable coins and gems from her mouth whenever she attempts to talk or sing. In “A Habit of Waste,” a self-conscious woman undergoes elective surgery to alter her appearance; days later she’s shocked to see her former body climbing onto a public bus. In “The Glass Bottle Trick,” the young protagonist ignores her intuition regarding her new husband’s superstitions—to horrifying consequences.

#13. *A Stranger in Olondria* by Sofia Samatar – 2013

Jevick, the pepper merchant’s son, has been raised on stories of Olondria, a distant land where books are as common as they are rare in his home. When his father dies and Jevick takes his place on the yearly selling trip to Olondria, Jevick’s life is as close to perfect as he can imagine. But just as he revels in Olondria’s Rabelaisian Feast of Birds, he is pulled drastically off course and becomes haunted by the ghost of an illiterate young girl.

In desperation, Jevick seeks the aid of Olondrian priests and quickly becomes a pawn in the struggle between the empire’s two most powerful cults. Yet even as the country shimmers on the cusp of war, he must face his ghost and learn her story before he has any chance of becoming free by setting her free: an ordeal that challenges his understanding of art and life, home and exile, and the limits of that seductive necromancy, reading.

#12. *The Fifth Season* by N. K. Jemisin – 2015

*Book 1 of 3 in the Broken Earth Series*

It starts with the great red rift across the heart of the world’s sole continent, spewing ash that blots out the sun. It starts with death, with a murdered son and a missing daughter. It starts with betrayal, and long dormant wounds rising up to fester.

This is the Stillness, a land long familiar with catastrophe, where the power of the earth is wielded as a weapon. And where there is no mercy.

The band is a hodgepodge, full of unusual characters with secrets of their own, including a shape-shifting man-animal known as Leopard.

As Tracker follows the boy’s scent—from one ancient city to another; into dense forests and across deep rivers—he and the band are set upon by creatures intent on destroying them. As he struggles to survive, Tracker starts to wonder: Who, really, is this boy? Why has he been missing for so long? Why do so many people want to keep Tracker from finding him? And perhaps the most important questions of all: Who is telling the truth, and who is lying?

#8. *The Rage of Dragons* by Evan Winter – 2017

*Book 1 of 2 in The Burning series*

Everyone else is fodder, destined to fight and die in the endless war.

#7. *Everfair* by Nisi Shawl – 2016

What if the African natives developed steam power ahead of their colonial oppressors? What might have come of Belgium’s disastrous colonization of the Congo if the native populations had learned about steam technology a bit earlier?

Fabian Socialists from Great Britain join forces with African-American missionaries to purchase land from the Belgian Congo’s “owner,” King Leopold II. This land, named Everfair, is set aside as a safe haven, an imaginary Utopia for native populations of the Congo as well as escaped slaves returning from America and other places where African natives were being mistreated.

#6. *Zoo City* by Lauren Beukes – 2010

*Correction: Lauren Beukes is South African, but white. Thanks to the redditors that pointed this out.*

Zinzi has a Sloth on her back, a dirty 419 scam habit, and a talent for finding lost things. When a little old lady turns up dead and the cops confiscate her last paycheck, Zinzi’s forced to take on her least favorite kind of job—missing persons.

Being hired by reclusive music producer Odi Huron to find a teenybop pop star should be her ticket out of Zoo City, the festering slum where the criminal underclass and their animal companions live in the shadow of hell’s undertow. Instead, it catapults Zinzi deeper into the maw of a city twisted by crime and magic, where she’ll be forced to confront the dark secrets of former lives—including her own.

> *“Beukes delivers a thrill ride that gleefully merges narrative styles and tropes, almost single-handedly pulling the ‘urban fantasy’ subgenre back towards its groundbreaking roots.”*

And when she travels to America for college, a traumatic event on campus crystallizes the selves into something powerful and potentially dangerous, making Ada fade into the background of her own mind as these other selves―now protective, now hedonistic―move into control.

When Paama leaves him for good, she attracts the attention of the undying ones—the djombi—who present her with a gift: the Chaos Stick, which allows her to manipulate the subtle forces of the world. Unfortunately, a wrathful djombi with indigo skin believes this power should be his and his alone.

Kindred is an astonishing, fantastic book. Author Butler is a master. This book is often considered science fiction, but it easily could be called fantasy.

Rufus, the white son of a plantation owner, is drowning, and Dana has been summoned to save him.

I remember GRATUITOUS rape and sexual slavery. I remember the main character having to play football to beat communism.

1639596382.0,Denis Villeneuve to adapt Arthur C. Clarke's RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA after he is done with DUNE,"Denis Villeneuve [has lined up](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/denis-villeneuve-rendezvous-with-rama-movie-1235062337/) his first post-**Dune** duology project. Villeneuve will be tackling a film adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's classic 1973 science fiction novel, *Rendezvous with Rama*.

Set in the year 2130, *Rendezvous with Rama* charts what happens when an apparently huge, rogue asteroid enters the Solar system. A probe flyby reveals that the object is in fact a geometrically perfect cylinder, fifty kilometres long, and clearly of alien origin. The spacecraft *Endeavour* is diverted to intercept the object, which is dubbed ""Rama."" Penetrating the interior of Rama, the explorers discover an entire alien world held within a cylindrical construct, apparently devoid of organic life...but that does not mean it isn't dangerous.

*Rendezvous with Rama* is Clarke's most acclaimed novel, even moreso than *2001: A Space Odyssey*. *Rama* won the Hugo, Nebula and John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Novel, as well as the Locus, Seiun, Jupiter and BSFA Awards. The book features a fictional space agency mission to look for rogue asteroids, known as Spaceguard. In 1992 NASA created a real Project Spaceguard, inspired by the fictional one. Since 1992, the Spaceguard and related programmes have discovered tens of thousands of Earth-orbit-crossing asteroids and comets.

Clarke returned to the setting sixteen years later, co-writing with former NASA engineer Gentry Lee a sequel trilogy dubbed **The Rama Cycle**: *Rama II* (1989), *The Garden of Rama* (1991) and *Rama Revealed* (1993). Lee later wrote two more novels in the same universe, but not featuring a Rama spacecraft: *Bright Messengers* (1995) and *Double Full Moon Night* (1999). These novels were not as well-received as the original book. Clarke noted that he considered these sequels to constitute one ""possible"" continuation or sequel to the original story, not the definitive one.

The novel has previously been adapted as a 1996 video puzzle game (inspired by *Myst*) and a 2009 BBC Radio adaptation. Morgan Freeman is a huge fan of the novel and in the 1990s picked up the film rights. He developed the project for many years, bringing on David Fincher to direct. The Freeman-Fincher partnership to make the film endured into 2012 before Fincher departed. Freeman noted that finding a script and finance for the film was difficult, partially due to the high vfx requirements but a distinct lack of traditional action sequences. Villeneuve is the perfect director to tackle this project, having encountered and overcome a similar restriction with his 2016 movie *Arrival*.

Alcon Entertainment (who shoot **The Expanse** for Amazon) will produce and finance the film. They are looking for a studio distribution partner. Villeneuve will tackle the project once *Dune: Part Two* is released in late 2023. Villeneuve had previously voiced a desire to adapt the second **Dune** novel, *Dune Messiah*, after completing the original novel, but it sounds like that would have to wait until after *Rendezvous*.",Fantasy

The spoiler free part, in case anyone still needs convincing to watch the show: 

* The whole cultural worldbuilding is *amazing*. I was super surprised when I realized the show was produced in America for the most part, simply because it's so unlike any other Western cartoons I've ever seen.   
* The writing and character development in this supposed kids' show put a whole lot of more supposedly 'mature' series to shame. 
* The animation is absolutely gorgeous, especially whenever there's combat.
* Aside from Legend of Korra, is there literally anything else remotely like this show? I've seen Trollhunters, which is also a decent YA/teen fantasy show, but I feel like it doesn't quite match the brilliance that is Avatar, at least so far. (Will be watching Korra next anyway, but after that?)  
* Really this show has everything you want from a good fantasy TV show. It's funny, it's epic, it's got really good dialogue, the conflicts feel real for the most part, the magic/bending is great and used fantastically (though if it weren't PG13, that stuff would look a lot different I imagine) 

---
Okay, and here come the spoilery parts 

* [Zuko's character arc](#s ""Zuko is no doubt my favorite character in the show and his whole story/development is freaking amazing. I love how much time the show takes to show him going from angsty spoiled brat with a vengeance to badass redeemed villain and hero"")  
* [Katara and romance](#s ""I don't know how popular or unpopular an opinion this is, but I was surprised and a bit disappointed that Katara ended up with Aang. All throughout the series, it seemed like she really liked him, but not necessarily in a romantic way. I thought Zuko and Katara had way more chemistry and was hoping that *that* was endgame shipping material. I don't even particularly dislike the development of her relationship with Aang, I just thought Zuko fit way better."") 
* [Bending](#s ""I love love love the development of bending over time, like how Katara discovers bloodbending and how Toph invents metalbending. I am stoked to see how these things get picked up again in Korra - I watched the first episode already so I know that metalbenders are now a thing."") 
* [Sokka](#s ""I'm not sure how much of an established trope/archetype this is, but Sokka is a fantastic example of the whole 'the one normal person among OP people' thing. The show gave him time to deal with that without it ever becoming annoying. Also, Sokka is hilarious and I love him"")

1645019942.0,"I'm reading every Hugo, Nebula, Locus, and World Fantasy Award winner. Here's my reviews up through 1990 (Vol 6)"," Hello again! Turns out that there are a lot of books out there. 

**Neuromancer by William Gibson**

* **Plot:** A down and out hacker gets in over his head.
* **Page Count:** 271
* **Award:** 1984 Hugo, 1984 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: Yes.
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Oh sweet saskatoons.
* **Review:** Look, it's great, alright? Does the story jump wildly? Sure. Does it require more than one reading? Probably. And yeah, it's intentionally confusing. But the plotting is superb - truly breakneck speed. And just what a world. It's spectacular. It's work to get into it, but I enjoyed the heck out of this.

**Mythago Wood by Robert Holdstock**

* **Plot:** There's a fine line between myth and reality, one that doesn't exist within the Wood.
* **Page Count:** 274
* **Award:** 1984 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Hard Fail
* **Technobabble:** Fantasy Babble in Spades.
* **Review:** Very clever premise and good writing that ultimately lack payoff. Unavoidable and excessive sexism to astounding levels. Obsession is a good character trait - but it's also the only one that anyone in this book has. Plot events occur for the sake of something happening - without reason, often without impact. They just... happen. Also, obsessively explaining the rules of this world while then having arbitrary new rules sneak up for plot convenience feels silly.

**Ender’s Game by Orson Scott Card**

* **Plot:** When the Buggers return, we're going to need the greatest military mind Earth can produce to stop them. Which means we need to start training young.
* **Page Count:** 256
* **Award:** 1985 Nebula, 1986 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: Absolutely
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Possible Technical Pass? But Likely Fail.
* **Technobabble:** Moderate.
* **Review:** Look, it's great, okay? Writing is solid, characters are consistent, pacing is deftly executed. Stakes are maintained throughout. Relentless nature of issues brilliantly done - the moment one issue is solved, another appears. It's just a really great book. It's got some flaws, sure. But it's just a joy to read. I'm also extremely biased: this is also the first real science fiction book I can recall reading, when I was nine.

**Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card**

* **Plot:** Ender Wiggin travels to the only planet where humans are interacting with another species, in the hopes of finding somewhere to leave the Bugger Queen.
* **Page Count:** 419
* **Award:** 1986 Nebula, 1987 Hugo
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Moderate.
* **Review:** A very different side of Ender, but a believable development. A truly massive cast of characters to keep track of, for the most part successfully. The Piggies are excellent - aliens with confusing customs, misunderstandings, physiology, and so on. And all grounded with some compelling and heartbreaking human drama. A worthy follow up to *Ender's Game*.

**Xenocide and Children of the Mind by Orson Scott Card**

* **Plot:** Buggers, Piggies, and Humans all live together in uneasy peace. But the descolada virus lives with them, lethal to humans. Perhaps the only way to stop it is to destroy the planet.
* **Page Count:**  

   * **Xenocide:** 592
   * **Children of the Mind:** 370
* **Award:** Books 3 and 4 of a series; 1 and 2 won awards.
* **Worth a read**: No. Which hurts to say.
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Mucho.
* **Review:** Were you satisfied with the evolution of Ender from *Ender's Game* to *Speaker for the Dead?* Good, because we're done with character development. Massive cast of characters, each with one negative character trait, which is fixed by the end of the story. Slapdash inclusion of galactic politics to try to add stakes instead rips out the human core of the Enderverse. Meanders unpleasantly - actual story has some interesting beats but could be told in a third of the time.

**Job: A Comedy of Justice by Robert Heinlein**

* **Plot:** When Alex comes to, he is not in his own world. Is God testing him?
* **Page Count:** 377
* **Award:** 1985 Locus Fantasy
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal to moderate.
* **Review:** All the fun of parallel worlds with no charm. Irritating characters responding in incomprehensible manners to unfortunate but often uninteresting twists of fate. New candidate for weakest female lead character in a book! Pacing is atrocious - up to and including a massive shift for the final third or so of the book, making it feel like two lackluster novellas. This book felt significantly longer than its 370 pages. Everything about this book feels half-baked and peculiarly self-indulgent.

**Song of Kali by Dan Simmons**

* **Plot:** It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to speak with an elusive author. But darkness and danger are everywhere...
* **Page Count:** 311
* **Award:** 1986 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: Maybe? But probably not.
* **Primary Driver:** Rare bonus: Atmosphere.
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal.
* **Review:** Excellent use of atmosphere, legitimately gripping as horror. Masterful interplay of understated yet unsettling and acutely horrifying. Pacing is slow but usually well executed to ratchet up tension. Like much horror, often hard to get behind the protagonist - he continues to do unreasonable things, and push himself needlessly further into these situations. Also, feels kinda... problematic. No one is slinging slurs around, but there's definitely some extreme fetishizing goin' down.

**The Postman by David Brin**

* **Plot:** Society has already collapsed. But someone needs to deliver the mail...
* **Page Count:** 339
* **Award:** 1986 Locus SF
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail (Slim chance that there's a technical pass, but... I don't think so.)
* **Technobabble:** Minimal to moderate.
* **Review:** I am a sucker for a good grifter, and Gordon Krantz is one of the best. He's one of the few ""full"" characters here - but I was rooting for him the whole time. The natural evolution of his role is believable; it keeps the story moving. His interpersonal interactions are also good - and the few other characters who are more developed are nicely done. *The Postman* stumbles when it tries to expand this small-scale story of a survivor to a broader world - pacing, plot, and character all suffer in the home stretch. Can be preachy about American Exceptionalism…

**Chronicles of Amber (Corwin Cycle) by Roger Zelazny**

* **Plot:** Amber, a parallel realm to ours, is in a state of turmoil. Fantasy hijinks ensue.
* **Page Count:**  

   * *Nine Princes in Amber: 175*
   * *The Guns of Avalon: 223*
   * *Sign of the Unicorn: 192*
   * *The Hand of Oberon: 188*
   * *The Courts of Chaos: 189*
* **Award:** None, but Book 6 (which begins the next quintet) won.
* **Worth a read**: Yes.
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot, World, or Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail (Unsure...)
* **Technobabble:** Fantasy Babble - yes
* **Review:** Delightful fantasy. Wildly unpredictable, charming protagonist, neat world. A deftly handled update to the standard sword and sorcery formula. Clearly written with tropes in mind, and uses them (or subverts them) to excellent effect. This is not an impactful read; it is not profound, or deeply thought-provoking, or anything else. It is instead a perfectly streamlined snack, and as such it is one of the best.

**Chronicles of Amber (Merlin Cycle) by Roger Zelazny**

* **Plot:** As much as Merlin wants to be his own person, Amber keeps pulling him in.
* **Page Count:**  

   * *Trumps of Doom: 184*
   * *Blood of Amber: 215*
   * *Sign of Chaos: 217*
   * *Knight of Shadows: 251*
   * *Prince of Chaos: 241*
* **Award:** *Trumps of Doom:* 1986 Locus Fantasy
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail.
* **Technobabble:** Mild fantasy babble.
* **Review:** A remarkable job of creating a sequel series. Takes the previous five books as a foundation and develops it, filling in details of the world. Also adds a new magic system – or, more accurately, adds new aspects to the already neat system of magic. Zelazny struggles a bit in giving Merlin a distinct voice from Corwin. Pacing stays quick, writing is cleaner than the earlier books. Merlin’s motivations are much clearer than Corwin’s as well. Totally enjoyable.

**Perfume: The Story of a Murderer by Patrick Süskind**

* **Plot:** If he gathers enough material, he'll be able to craft the perfect smell. He'll finally smell human.
* **Page Count:** 263
* **Award:** 1987 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**) + **Atmosphere**
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail.
* **Technobabble:** Barely.
* **Review:** Evil is a challenge. How do you make a monster believable? If it's too ridiculous, there's no justification. If motivations are too believable, well, your monster is not really evil. Süskind nails it. This is evil as a fundamental lack of morality; an indifference to the needs and wants of others. And it's terrifying. Pacing is not always great, plot meanders a bit - but the mood, which is the essential characteristic of a horror story, stays oppressive, and unsettling. At less than 300 pages, this is worth reading for that alone.

**Seventh Son by Orson Scott Card**

* **Plot:** In an alternate-history America, the seventh son of a seventh son is born with remarkable abilities.
* **Page Count:** 377
* **Award:** 1987 Locus Fantasy
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** None.
* **Review:** An intriguing alternate timeline that is ultimately undercut by bloat and poor pacing. Interesting use of different magic systems. Many well written scenes of believable family interaction, generally convincing interpersonal stakes. The protagonist, however, is the least compelling character by dint of being exceptional at everything. Weak antagonists as well. This book is longer than it needs to be, the series is even more so.

**Tales of Alvin the Maker by Orson Scott Card**

* **Plot:** In an America much like our own, Alvin is one of the only forces of order capable of countering the Unmaker.
* **Page Count:**  

   * **Red Prophet**\*: 311\*
   * **Prentice Alvin**\*: 342\*
   * **Alvin Journeyman**\*: 381\*
   * **Heartfire**\*: 336\*
   * **The Crystal City**\*: 340\*
* **Award:**  

   * **Red Prophet**\*: 1988 Locus Fantasy\*
   * **Prentice Alvin**\*: 1989 Locus Fantasy\*
   * **Alvin Journeyman**\*: 1995 Locus Fantasy\*
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass, but only barely. As in, I think in only one book.
* **Technobabble:** Mild fantasy babble.
* **Review:** The delicate crafting of Alvin's world gets wackier and wackier the further the series goes. Card desperately scrambles to cram any and all historical figures he can into the narrative with little to no justification. Pervasive religious themes come across as excessive. Slow plotting and attempts to overdevelop backstories leave the story at a standstill.
* **One Sentence Summaries of Each Book**  

   * **Red Prophet**\*:\* What this series really needed was more backstories and some genocide.
   * **Prentice Alvin**\*:\* Racism is bad, education is groovy.
   * **Alvin Journeyman**\*:\* The best way to add action to a series is including legal proceedings.
   * **Heartfire**\*:\* Witchcraft trials are not super-ethical.
   * **The Crystal City**\*:\* The real Crystal City is the friends we made along the way.

**Replay by Ken Grimwood**

* **Plot:** Jeff Winston dies of a heart attack and returns as his younger self. What would you do with a second chance?
* **Page Count:** 311
* **Award:** 1988 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: No.
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Minimal to none.
* **Review:** The most generic possible take on (de facto) time travel. Dislikable protagonist doing the blandest and most predictable possible things. If you've read anything similar, you know every single beat of this story. Unremarkable writing. Slow pacing. Completely underwhelming.

**Soldier of the Mist by Gene Wolfe**

* **Plot:** Latro forgets everything: he must keep a close record on a scroll. Even his meetings with gods.
* **Page Count:** 335
* **Award:** 1987 Locus Fantasy
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Nah.
* **Review:** A lot of fun elements that do not quite gel. All of the basic elements of story are good: interesting cast of characters, particularly the cameos from different gods; cool settings as we wander through ancient Greece; generally good pacing. It is the central conceit of this book that makes it hard to read: it feels like 20% of the text is Latro either being informed or informing others that his memory does not work. It gets exhausting - and while the rest of this is better than competent, it's not enjoyable. Also, Wolfe's terrible at ending books.

**Soldier of Arete by Gene Wolfe**

* **Plot:** The great amnesiac adventure continues!
* **Page Count:** 354
* **Award:** None, but books one and three of the trilogy won.
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail.
* **Technobabble:** None.
* **Review:** A less-inspired continuation of the Latro's journey. Wolfe's love of obtuse allusions to historical events and figures would make this a compelling mystery if this was even remotely engaging. Neither characters or situations draw the reader in enough to make this feel like more than a slog. Actual quality of writing is quite high - deft use of imagery, poetic phrasing that avoids feeling overdone. But all in service of an underwhelming product.

**Soldier of Sidon by Gene Wolfe**

* **Plot:** Our favorite amnesiac soldier is back, but this time he's in Egypt!
* **Page Count:** 320
* **Award:** 2006 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: Not really.
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** No.
* **Review:** Did you like the military adventures of Sir Forgetful the first two times it came out? Then this is a great book for you. A different set of supporting characters and a new location - as well as a significant in-world time jump - offer surface level differentiation from the previous volumes. But once the adventure actually begins it is more of the same. Slow pacing and constant reminders of amnesia punctuated with occasional excellent scenes involving the gods. Also, Wolfe's still terrible at ending books.

**The Falling Woman by Pat Murphy**

* **Plot:** An estranged mother and daughter are reconnected on a troubled archeological dig.
* **Page Count:** 287
* **Award:** 1988 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** None
* **Review:** A bland coming of age story/relationship drama with pretensions of being either horror or suspense. Characters are flat: the woman who threw herself into her career and ignored her family, the man who needs to protect people, the old woman who is superstitious. Story is a plodding mess that is meant to give the characters and their interactions the spotlight - but characters don't deliver, and the whole thing crumbles. Boring and predictable.

**Falling Free by Lois McMaster Bujold**

* **Plot:** Quaddies were genetically engineered to thrive in null gravity. Too bad they're basically kept as slaves.
* **Page Count:** 320
* **Award:** 1988 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: For a Vorkosigan Saga completionist: Yes. But can be skipped.
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Yes.
* **Review:** One of the weaker stories in the *Vorkosigan Saga.* Characters lack depth - and the childlike state in which the quaddies are kept becomes grating. Pacing is decent and the story is somewhat engaging. Leo Graf, the main ""standard"" human character, is far more compelling than any of the quaddies. Corporate greed is a believable but underwhelming bad guy, because \[gestures vaguely at everything\].

**Cyteen by C J Cherryh**

* **Plot:** The only person brilliant enough to run the cloning colony cannot live forever - but a perfect copy of her can take her place.
* **Page Count:** 680
* **Award:** 1989 Hugo and 1989 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** Oh yes.
* **Review:** Slow, dull, and plodding, this book is a rough read. Interpersonal relationships are the backbone of the story but a lack of believable or compelling characters make it all fall flat. Beneath it all are some legitimately interesting questions of identity and self, couched in the context of cloning but more broadly applicable. These are posed as unresolved questions, and would be better served by a short story than a text girthy enough to pull a body underwater.

**The Healer's War by Elizabeth Ann Scarborough**

* **Plot:** A nurse in Vietnam tries to navigate the everyday danger of life on the front, and puts herself at risk to care for others.
* **Page Count:** 336
* **Award:** 1989 Nebula
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (Plot, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass
* **Technobabble:** None
* **Review:** Turns out the Vietnam War was not that great. Turns out being a woman in a warzone is not that great. Turns out viewing your enemies as subhuman is not that great. This is a character-driven story, and is semi-autobiographical. Kitty is likeable enough, though inconsistent. There is not really a story, exactly. She is thrown from one situation to another, usually without agency of her own. Pacing is all over the place. Not a terrible book but feels like yet another war story in a long line of such.

**Koko by Peter Straub**

* **Plot:** A series of murders over many decades point to only one person: Koko. But his former squad mates could have sworn he was dead...
* **Page Count:** 562
* **Award:** 1989 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** Doesn't really apply.
* **Review:** Turns out that the Vietnam war was pretty much not a good thing. Superb use of atmosphere and mood coupled with generally good writing. Plot is not great, heavy flashbacks break flow of present-day story. Scenes of gratuitous gore and violence are at first shocking and then become dull. Most characters are flat, making it hard to stay invested in what is a heavily people-driven story. Ends up feeling more like an experience than a story. And gets relentlessly depressing.

**Mystery by Peter Straub**

* **Plot:** The best detective out there - a misanthropic bookworm - tackles corruption and violence in his own backyard.
* **Page Count:** 548
* **Award:** Sequel to *Koko*. No awards of its own. Published 1990.
* **Worth a read**: Yes
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass.
* **Technobabble:** None.
* **Review:** A delightful if surprisingly dark mystery/adventure. Elevated above comparable stories by compelling protagonists and a clear love of books woven throughout. As is the case with many mysteries, some jumps are a bit contrived - but the suspense elements deliver, and Straub's writing shines. Excellent character work.

**The Throat by Peter Straub**

* **Plot:** Tim Underwood and Tom Pasmore team up to investigate a death close to Underwood.
* **Page Count:** 692
* **Award:** None, final book in *Blue Rose Trilogy*
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, World, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail
* **Technobabble:** None.
* **Review:** A decent horror thriller with interesting meta-fiction elements. However, it feels less like a culmination of a trilogy than a retread, and does not build appreciably upon *Mystery*. Main character work generally solid, but falls off for side characters. Writing is good, plot is messy. Pacing is alright for a 700 page tome, but the story does not justify its length.

**Lyonesse Trilogy by Jack Vance**

* **Plot:** Kingdoms vie for supremacy, wizards do the same, and the fairy folk mock them from the sidelines.
* **Page Count:**
* **Suldrun's Garden:** 436
* **The Green Pearl:** 406
* **Madouc:** 544
* **Award:** Madouc - 1990 World Fantasy Award
* **Worth a read**: No
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or Character)
* **Bechdel Test**: Pass.
* **Technobabble:** Some magic gibberish.
* **Review:** A fantasy epic with a remarkable number of storylines, sometimes told out of chronological order. As a demonstration of how to effectively interweave a huge number of characters and plots this is a masterclass. This does not, however, make it an enjoyable read. Character work is underwhelming - a few standouts highlight how flat most of the others are. Pacing is choppy - sudden frenetic bursts followed by 100 page slumps. World feels pretty standard for medieval fantasy - tricky fae, conspiratorial wizards, arrogant monarchs. Ultimately there is nothing terribly wrong with this trilogy, it just does not feel worth 1300 pages.

**Hyperion by Dan Simmons**

* **Plot:** Seven pilgrims journey to the one place that connects them: the planet Hyperion.
* **Page Count:** 492
* **Award:** 1990 Hugo, 1990 Locus SF
* **Worth a read**: Yes. Right now.
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot, World, or Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Possible Pass?
* **Technobabble:** Moderate.
* **Review:** Hot diggity dog. What a book. It's a masterpiece. The world is great. The characters are distinct and fantastic. A sense of mystery permeates everything, as well as urgency. Every plot beat is woven brilliantly - each character telling their story informs another, fills in blanks. But doesn't overfill! Keeps things mysterious! World building both answers and raises questions - but so, so, so well. Writing is crisp, pacing is great. I cannot recommend this one enough. Go! Get thee to a bookery!

**The Fall of Hyperion by Dan Simmons**

* **Plot:** The Shrike is not the only threat facing the pilgrims of Hyperion, and much needs to be resolved before the Time Tomb opens.
* **Page Count:** 517
* **Award:** 1991 Locus SF
* **Worth a read**: Yes.
* **Primary Driver:** (**Plot**, **World**, or **Character**)
* **Bechdel Test**: Fail(?)
* **Technobabble:** Yeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh
* **Review:** A decent sequel, though a huge change in both tone and format from *Hyperion.* Characters are solid, though heavily dependent upon their development in the first book. Plot is interesting enough to keep raising questions - but not every answer is satisfying. Pacing is all over the place - intermittent monologues pause everything for the sake of exposition. Read it because you've read the first book.

The Bechdel Test is a simple question: do two named female characters converse about something other than a man. Whether or not a book passes is not a condemnation so much as an observation; it provides an easy binary marker. Seems like a good way to see how writing has evolved over the years. At the suggestion of some folks, I’m loosening it to non-male identified characters to better capture some of the ways that science fiction tackles sex and gender.

Greetings Ladies and Gentlemen, Elves and Demons,

On August 17, 2018 the fantasy cartoon comedy Disenchantment by Matt Groening, creator of the much beloved Simpsons and Futurama, was released with a second season soon following. Since that day, my every waking moment has been consumed by dark festering vitriol for the show. Okay, maybe not every moment. But this is an internet rant, I’m obligated to exaggerate a little, right? In truth, I find the show fascinating despite my dislike for it. If you’d be so kind I’d like to use this post to vent my explosive animosity in a raving rant that will attempt to parse the contrasting reactions people have had to the show and construct a theory about which elements attract or repel the differing audience factions.

There seem to be two major camps: people who liked the show and people who were very meh about the show. I haven’t really seen anyone who actually hates the show in the same way as, let’s say, the Eragon movie adaption. The people who dislike it seem to think it was boring and unfunny, but not to a painful degree. They simply stopped watching or finished but were underwhelmed. Despite my introductory ravings, I fall into this camp. I don’t hate Disenchantment; it’s just boring.

Some of my dislike, I think, is a matter of my expectations. I was looking forward to Disenchantment partially because of Futurama’s reputation for its nerdy sci-fi references and so my thought was that this show would have a similar degree of genre savviness. I had seen articles puffing up the show as Groening’s lampoon of contemporary fantasy shows like Game of Thrones.

This expectation turned out to be dead wrong. As a mindless hatefan of the show, I have devoured interviews by Groening from which flowed an obvious conclusion: Disenchantment is not a lampoon of contemporary fantasy like Game of Thrones but a parody of classic fairy tales and fantasy from Groening’s youth.

[Groening listed his influences](https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/disenchantment-influences-list/ls029771332/?ref_=ls_mv_sm) as works like Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Italian Folktales by Italo Calvino (1956), Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride (1987), Jabberwock (1977), The Wizard of Oz (1939), and the original Pinocchio (1883). He also pays a bit of lip service to Lord of the Rings, though it sounds like he just assumes it’s an influence because of how foundational it is to the genre.

Notice a trend? As iconic as many of these works are, they’re all over 40 years old. The most recent influence he lists is the 20-year-old Spirited Away.
Where Futurama oozed with creative usage of the setting and genre, Disenchantment trickled. Even just comparing the pilots of the two shows, Futurama has relatively uncommon sci-fi concepts like suicide booths and heads-in-jars while Disenchantment’s pilot has an unwanted arranged marriage and Lollipop Guild Keebler elves.

Is this a bad thing? Did Groening do something wrong? Technically, no. I don’t consider contemporary relevance an artistic virtue, but it certainly impacts the appeal of the show. This is what I believe dictates the watershed of audience reactions.

I think that those who are looking for the humor in the show to be derived from satirical takes on fantasy tropes, references, or creative usages of the fantasy genre are going to be bored by uninspired rehashing of half-century-old tropes while those who are more drawn to Groening’s character-focused banter and slapstick comedy will be amused.

An example of this divergence of reactions may the scene where our protagonist Princess Bean makes a drunken fool of herself at a diplomatic banquet. Groening intended this to be funny in two ways: first, as the timeless [Alcohol-Induced Idiocy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholInducedIdiocy) gag and, second, as the subversion of proper princess behavior.

[As Groening explains](https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/tv/matt-groening-disenchantment-influences-50816), “The reason why she drinks so much is not because I'm fond of alcohol jokes. It's because I want you to know from the beginning that this is not Cinderella, and this is not Disney. It's like, 'What wouldn't Disney do?' Well, they wouldn't have the princess get drunk!""

This is our first hint that Groening’s focus on classic fairy tales and tropes is not an informed artistic choice but a byproduct of being uninformed about the nuances of contemporary fantasy. 

Sure, a kid-targeted company wouldn’t get a princess drunk, but Cinderella was released 70 years ago, and Disney is full-throttle into an era of bucking many of the tropes they’ve been criticizing for in the past and dozens, more likely hundreds, of stories have bucked that particular trend before. Disney’s 2007 Enchanted is a great example of how this type of parody has become mainstream and it’s long ago wormed its way into the mainline princess films. Seeing a princess misbehaving is the expectation, not the exception.

When I say in the title that the writers of Disenchantment aren’t into fantasy, I don’t mean to gatekeep. It seems that recently Groening has rediscovered an old love of the fantastical and that is a beautiful thing. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that Groening is into a very narrow and outdated type of classic fantasy which has led him to believe he is being subversive when he is truly being by-the-numbers. Such as when the witch turns out to be the misunderstood victim in Disenchantment’s take on Hansel and Gretel. Once again, it was not surprising, it was expected, and, therefore, it was uninteresting.  

As for the other writers, I can’t truly comment on them because they seem to be kept on a tight leash. Bafflingly, he has a [rule against Game of Thrones](https://mashable.com/article/matt-groening-disenchantment-game-of-thrones-reference-easter-egg/) references and has admitted to actively shooting down his writers’ attempts to get around the rule. 

“’I had to flat-out say: “This has nothing to do with Game of Thrones.”’ Yet people still tried to sneak it in occasionally, leading Groening to put his foot down even more. ‘No — we are not doing it!’”

Another interview I read hinted at some tension between the older and younger writers on staff and I would imagine the older writers usually won any disagreements due to seniority.

“We have a writing staff that’s a combination of old guys from Futurama and The Simpsons and some younger writers who definitely have a different point of view,” [says Groening](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/03/matt-groening-goes-back-to-the-drawing-board-for-disenchantment/). “They just don’t understand the appeal of old character actors from the 1930s and ’40s.”

Groening had been watching Game of Thrones, but actively stopped watching for the three years he made Disenchantment because he didn’t want to be influenced by it. While I can wave away much of his lack of fantasy knowledge as the harmless result of age gaps, I can’t think of a term to describe this other than willful ignorance. Perhaps Groening truly does consciously intend for his take on fantasy solely to focus on old classics. Like I said, there isn’t anything technically wrong with this and I don’t think being a fantasy fan has anything to do with how up to date you are or how much you’ve consumed, but I guess it’s hard for me to believe someone is truly a  fan when they go out of their way to avoid reading or watching fantasy. How does someone who is into fantasy seriously not have a single influence made within the past two decades?

As Stephen King famously suggests, the best way to improve your writing is to read as much as you can. Surely an inverse rule could be suggested. Something like “The best way to cripple your writing is to avoid reading.” Suddenly, the shallowness of Disenchantment’s fantasy setting makes sense. Elsewhere, there are hints that this avoidance has fed into certain misunderstandings he has about the genre. 

""The tendency for fantasy – and many Hollywood films – is 'good versus evil,' we tried to make the world not so black and white,"" [Groening said](https://www.imdb.com/imdbpicks/disenchantment-influences-list/ls029771332/mediaviewer/rm2828972032).

Hmm. Yes. If only we had more dark versions of fairy tales laced with moral ambiguity. Funnily enough, I wouldn’t even say Disenchantment succeeds at moral ambiguity. In every situation where it counts, Bean is kind to the unfortunate, loyal to her friends, opposes evil, and apologizes for her mistakes. Such dilemmas are always clear cut. Even the demon’s only crimes are being snarky, smoking, and giving up his immortality to save his drinking buddies. What’s that? That last one didn’t sound like something an incarnation of pure evil would do? How subversive! The demon was good at heart all along! Friendship saving the day truly is heartwarming. Ugh. Disney’s [Descendants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descendants_\(2015_film\)) was more morally ambiguous than Disenchantment. (Don’t watch Descendants though. Disenchantment was way better. Descendants was cringe, and I love musicals.)

Groening’s avoidance of contemporary fantasy also seems to fit poorly with his attempt to have Disenchantment be his first narrative focused project. Disenchantment’s story is passable, but uninspiring. Bean, the rebellious princess who always does the right thing in the end turns out to be the chosen one…but chosen for evil! How innovative.

Is it so surprising that much of his audience is bored by Groening’s take on Fractured Fairy Tales when many of them, myself included, have grown up hearing the fractured versions before they hear the originals?

And so, my theory is that those looking for fantasy parody will likely not be amused by Disenchantment’s subversions that are actually clichés, but those who are there for wholesome lowbrow humor and drunken buddy shenanigans, or have little exposure to other works of fantasy, may be satisfied. Despite utilizing the fantasy genre, Groening has no obligation to make it more than a pretty backdrop for character comedy to suit my somewhat snobbish fantasy tastes. Narrowing audience appeal is not a crime. 

Regardless, I think Groening thinks he is being innovative with the fantasy genre when he is not.

“Every time I thought of a different kind of fantasy trope, I’d write it down and see if there was a way of sticking it in the show. I have lists of every kind of small mythical forest creature: gnomes, fairies, imps, goblins, gremlins, trolls, plus a bunch that I can’t remember right now. It’s all there in the notebook. But it’s hard. If you want to tell jokes about elves and dragons and so on and so forth, pretty soon you realize, Oh, every single dragon joke has already been made,” [Groening said.](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a22627833/matt-groening-disenchantment-netflix-interview/)

Perhaps it is telling that when he discusses fantasy tropes, he lists surface-level set pieces. Perhaps it is telling that his image of elves is more in line with a cookie commercial than one of their hundreds of portrayals in various fantasy works.   

I think this is a tale of an expert stepping outside of his wheelhouse and stumbling. I want to emphasize that Disenchantment is a competently executed show. The jokes are competent. The story is competent. The characters are competent. But, they’re bland and boring. There is nothing new to be found here, and Groening does not wield the old clichés well enough to imbue them with new life.

Still, trying new things is to be commended. I hope his experience with this show results in Groening being exposed the marvelously deeps and rich fantasy worlds he is missing out on. As he is a cartoonist, I’d recommend he start with some Disney shows that blow his out of the water in terms of creative fantasy settings and narrative strength like Gravity Falls and Star vs. the Forces of Evil. I’d also say he should read Pratchett, but, shockingly, he has. I wouldn’t have won that bet.

Thanks for letting me vent my bile! Am I simply blinded by my incoherent hater rage or am I enlightened by supremely logical righteous anger? If you liked Disenchantment, was it for the fantasy stuff or for the other elements in the show?

""He could laugh at anybody, but most of all himself, and his complete lack of any sense of dignity could and often did make him behave like a riotous schoolboy. At a New Year's Eve party in the nineteen-thirties he would don an Icelandic sheepskin hearthrug and paint his face white to impersonate a polar bear, or he would dress up as an Anglo-Saxon warrior complete with axe and chase an astonished neighbour down the road. Later in life he delighted to offer inattentive shopkeepers his false teeth among a handful of change.

1600629723.0,Hyperion is a masterpiece,"Haven’t enjoy a book like this in so long. Had actually been turned off fantasy a little recently. Had finished Wheel of Time, which is incredible. But it’s vast, lots of characters, lots of places, complex, but still brilliant. 

Then I moved on to Malazan. This broke me a little. No clue what’s going on most of the time. Started the 2nd book and couldn’t go further.  Sometimes fantasy gets a little too much for me. Too many nations, wars, characters, etc. Can be hard to follow, and especially difficult when I’m on audible

But Hyperion is wonderful. Love the knitting together of the stories. It almost reminds me of a Stephen Kjng series of short stories. Love the mystery. Great characters. A truly enjoyable sci fi fantasy novel that doesn’t overwhelm you with with an overly broad landscape and character list",Fantasy
