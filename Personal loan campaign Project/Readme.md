### Context

AllLife Bank is a US bank that has a growing customer base. The majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).

A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio.

As a Data scientist at AllLife bank, I have to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan.

### Objective

To predict whether a liability customer will buy personal loans, to understand which customer attributes are most significant in driving purchases, and identify which segment of customers to target more.

# Business Recommendations
* The ZIPCode column could potentially be a very valuable information source. However, there isn't nearly enough data in this set for it to make any difference in any of the predictive models. I would recommend a bigger data set if one is available.
* The model with the highest test Recall value is the pre-pruned model. We're most concerned about True positive predictions and thus want to limit False negatives. This model does the best on Recall with a 79% success rate. It also scores really well on Accuracy: 98%, Precision: 100% and F1: 88%.
